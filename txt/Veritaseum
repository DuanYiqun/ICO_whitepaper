Description: Veritaseum is a smart contracts-based, peer-to-peer wallet interface (in beta) that 

currently interacts with Bitcoin blockchain (to be ported to Ethereum). It allows non-technical 
individuals & entities to quickly create, enter and manage smart contracts directly with others 
without an authoritative 3rd party. It was the first of its kind written on a public or private blockchain.  

Problem being solved: Financial institutions that control most global transactions have a 
structural deficiency in their business model – overcompensation. Up to 60% of gross revenues are 
paid out to employees. This “structural deficiency” in the financial entity business model is passed as 
higher expenses, directly to the consumers of financial products and services. These higher expenses 
tend to manifest themselves in manners encompassing more than just greater cost – higher 
transaction friction, conflicts of interest, material counterparty and credit risks, etc. 

Veritaseum utilizes smart contracts and blockchain technology to enable individuals and 
entities to transact directly with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion, with capital escrowed to the 
blockchain contingent upon smart contract-enforced, mutually agreed terms. Due to the nature of 
these “smart contracts”, the agreements cannot be broken, contracts cannot be breached and 
most importantly, each side is forced to deliver under an and all circumstances. This is done 
without the highly compensated “staff” of extant financial entities at costs that are dramatically 
lower than status quo. Veritaseum is enabling software-driven peer-to-peer capital markets without 
brokerages, banks or traditional exchanges. Veritaseum is a software concern, not a financial 
concern and no actors on its platform are exposed to its balance sheet in any way, nor does 
Veritaseum hold, control or have the ability to frustrate access to any participant’s capital. 

Upcoming Products & Services: Veritaseum has global (US, UK, EU, China, Japan) patents 
pending for the application of its technology for P2P letters of credit and P2P value trading (with long 
running functional beta facilitating the trading of exposure for over 25k tickers of 
stocks/bonds/forex/commodities) predating all similar applications mgmt. is aware of, ref. pg 18). 
DAOs (digital autofocus organizations) are being designed to disintermediate businesses with high 
structural costs by offering similar services at near zero margin, while funneling analysis and 
infrastructure business to Veritaseum (full description). 

Risks: Dependent upon availability & fortitude of Ethereum public blockchain. Veritaseum strives 
to be platform agnostic, but man/months (at a minimum) would be required to rewrite for a different 
blockchain. Regulation in this space has not kept up with the pace of innovation, hence there is 
ambiguity. If Veritaseum is successful, significant and very heavily capitalized competition will arrive 
very quickly. Many institutions have already filed multiple blockchain-related patent applications 

Use of digital assets: Research and Development 30%; Sales, Marketing, Business Development: 
30%; Operations: 13%; Legal: 10%; Reserves: 10%; DAO liquidity provisions: 7%
