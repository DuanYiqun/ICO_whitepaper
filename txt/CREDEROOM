Whitepaper

2017

https://crederoom.com


credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.Incorporated in European Union

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Whitepaper

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Whitepaper

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

-0,328%

3 Month EURIBOR + 2%-2,5%

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

Whitepaper

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Whitepaper

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on. 

Roadmap

April 2017
CREDEROOM started development of the software and technologies. Main efforts 
were concentrated on Analytics, mostly building Predictive Analytics platform. On the 
date this document was written we had models for fraud detection, credit risk and 
credit score evaluation. While some part of company are running ICO Campaign, 
development remains in progress all the time. 

16 October 2017 - 15 November 2017
ICO Campaign. Funds aggregated during this campaign will be used for the initial 
development of the business and technologies. 

15-21 November 2017
CDRT Token release.

November 2017
Incorporation of The Main Company in Cantone Zug, Switzerland.

January 2018
HR Campaign will be held for both: The Main Company and the subsidiary 
companies in the states of Zone A.
Optional. To lower expenses on development, the subsidiary companies can be 
incorporated in a country outside the European Union.

in 2018
Further development of the software and technologies. The task will require strong 
collaboration of experts in all areas: credit score, marketing, legal, security 
specialists, accountants, mathematicians and software engineers.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

Localization of the software and technologies for the ZoneC state’s languages. 

Marketing Campaigns in the states of Zone C.



credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Whitepaper

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

Whitepaper

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Whitepaper

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Whitepaper

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Whitepaper

MCC MSINMNC

No more than 15 digits

NMSI

IMSI

3 digits 2 or 3

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on. 

Roadmap

April 2017
CREDEROOM started development of the software and technologies. Main efforts 
were concentrated on Analytics, mostly building Predictive Analytics platform. On the 
date this document was written we had models for fraud detection, credit risk and 
credit score evaluation. While some part of company are running ICO Campaign,

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Whitepaper

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Whitepaper

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Whitepaper

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Whitepaper

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer ’s data. 
On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize risks. 
Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it is possible 
to boost company’s performance greatly.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke


credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Whitepaper

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Whitepaper

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Whitepaper

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on. 

Roadmap

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Whitepaper

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

Whitepaper

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

Whitepaper

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

Whitepaper

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

Whitepaper

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Whitepaper

1 1 EUR=

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Whitepaper

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on. 

Roadmap

April 2017
CREDEROOM started development of the software and technologies. Main efforts 
were concentrated on Analytics, mostly building Predictive Analytics platform. On the 
date this document was written we had models for fraud detection, credit risk and 
credit score evaluation. While some part of company are running ICO Campaign, 
development remains in progress all the time. 

16 October 2017 - 15 November 2017
ICO Campaign. Funds aggregated during this campaign will be used for the initial 
development of the business and technologies. 

15-21 November 2017
CDRT Token release.

November 2017
Incorporation of The Main Company in Cantone Zug, Switzerland.

January 2018
HR Campaign will be held for both: The Main Company and the subsidiary 
companies in the states of Zone A.
Optional. To lower expenses on development, the subsidiary companies can be 
incorporated in a country outside the European Union.

in 2018
Further development of the software and technologies. The task will require strong 
collaboration of experts in all areas: credit score, marketing, legal, security

Neverending Story of development of the software and technologies

January 2022

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Whitepaper

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.

Whitepaper



credere – verb. It. to trust, to believe 

Word Credit came to almost all European 
languages from the Italian word credere.

Credit is a contractual agreement in which a 
borrower receives something of value now and 
agrees to repay the lender at some date in the 

future, generally with interest. 

infinita an fiduciam fons

Introduction 
Have you ever given much thought to the time of day you ask for a loan? What about how many 
emails you send out every day? You’re using a new email for the express purpose of applying for 
the loan? Did you know that your Facebook friends could determine how likely you are to repay a 
loan? 

Well, billions seemingly innocuous elements may be more accurate than the usual credit score in 
determining repayment reliability. We will learn all of them.

The CREDEROOM project is a team of financial, security, legal and 
technical experts. We are raising funds in order to develop a 

lending company operating throughout the European Union.

It can be a complex financial and executive task to run a successful lending company, but the 
potential revenues can outweigh the complications and risks. With the appropriate planning and 
leadership, the company has an endless potential.

We would like to present a combination of an old fashion 
business and the modern digital technologies. Similar to 
icebergs only small part of which is visible above the 
surface of the sea, the lending business is only a small 
part of the CREDEROOM project.

We plan to develop a high-power scalable platform aimed 
to ease management of financial assets and marketing 
actions. An open-source API and modern technologies will 
make us a company with a high cost-benefit ratio.

Lending 

Typical loan we are aiming for is a small unsecured loan from 50 to 500 Euros for a term of 30 
days. Average APRs on such loans are from 150% to 1500%. They vary from country to country 
in the EU and depend on a country’s economics and legislation. A high cost-benefit ratio in this 
business will give us good growth and development, which in turn will result in faster development 
of technologies and new services.

Credit Portfolio Capital
On 20 June of 2017, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank have made a decision 
to keep all rates on the previous level. This includes the deposit facility rate that was kept 
negative at -0.4%1.

At the moment when this document was developed, the three-month EURIBOR was negative 
either at -0.328%2. 

According to the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank, the assets of 
European banks have been approximately 1 trillion Euros; they can be kept in cash or deposited 
in the ECB. By keeping their assets, European banks lose money anyway. Deposit at the ECB is 
unprofitable because of the negative rate, and it is hard to imagine what resources would be 
necessary to keep this amount of cash.

CREDEROOM is not new to the financial market. It has 
been a long time we have worked on the financial 
market of the European Union under the name … 
providing lending services to both residents and 
non-residents of the EU.

During the working period, we have developed strong 
partnerships with several European banks, and when 
the idea of the EU-wide lending company was 
introduced, these banks were among first we shared 
the idea with.

Banks were interested and highly rated our idea and the technological background. All of them 
are ready to invest their capitals in our credit portfolio with interest rates at 

A partner bank is looking forward to investing in software and 
technology development, which we have not accepted yet. 
Our reasons are simple. 

We believe in the open-source community and 
believe that most of technologies should be open to 

public.

If we will partner with bank technology will be owned by the bank and not go open-source.
The World of Fintech 
There are many Fintech companies in the world and we would like to tell about those inspiring us:

ZestFinance LA, uses Big Data to underwrite loans. 

Funding 60 million USD. 

Partner of Chinese web giant JD.com

LENDDO – API solution from Philippines, that analyze over 12000 data points of customers 
seeking loans. 

Funding 14 million USD. 

Works in 10 countries.

AIRE.IO credit score, credit check, API for lenders. 

Funding 5 million USD only this year. 

Partner of UK subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services.

Idea
According to KMPG report in Q1 2017, global investment in Fintech companies hit 
3,2 billion USD.

We have spent time on development of our idea, the concept, vision and business plan, and now 
we are ready to present our project to public. We are making an offer to everyone who would like 
to become a part of the brand new, future world.

This document covers the business, technical and legal aspects of our project, the road map of 
its development and the description of the technologies for the CREDEROOM infrastructure we 
are working on.

European Union wide operation.

Development of new services and new markets.

To be continued...

European Union and Country Zones
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of the 28 member states. Its 
population in 2015 was more than 506 million people; there are many national languages in use; 
the legislation and business practice vary from country to country.

A lot of preparatory work should be done to commence the operation of our project in all EU 
states. The quality of the team and the amount of capital aggregated during ICO will greatly 
influence the speed of our development. 

We would like to be as open as possible and will do our best to provide comprehensive 
information on our strategy and tactics to everyone interested. We have divided all the 28 EU 
states into 4 Zones. We took population, economics and business environment of the states into 
consideration.

Zone A
 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia

Approx. market capacity: 15 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 17 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 25.5 million EUR.

Zone B

Finland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Romania

Approx. market capacity: 26 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 20 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 30 million EUR

Zone C

Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Portugal, Greece

Approx. market capacity: 52 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio 1 year: 100 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit,  1 year: 110 million EUR.

Zone D 
Poland, Italy, Spain, France, Ireland, UK*, Germany

Approx. market capacity: 200 million people;
Max. estimated credit portfolio, 1 year: 150 million EUR;
Estimated gross profit, 1 year: 180 million EUR.

Approx. market capacity is equivalent of the population of the zone in the age between 18 and 65 
years old. Certain risks exist when lending to young or elderly borrower. Still, our studies show 
that, in the long term, profits exceed possible risks.

Max. estimated credit portfolio and Estimated gross profit are calculated considering reasonable 
costs of marketing campaign and reasonable number of staff for the first year of operation, in the 
selected zone.

New estimated values for next year of operation will be published regularly 2 months prior to the 
end of a year. 

* Can be excluded from plans if Brexit results in bad business environment.

Digital technologies

Digitalization of our daily lives is now undisputed. Fast and reliable internet is available and used 
by 82% of the EU population3.  More than 60% of the EU citizens use smartphones connected to 
4G networks. Finances are also a part of this modern digital world.

Everybody knows such companies as Facebook, Google or Amazon. They are able to collect, 
process and analyze enormous amounts of data related to users’ behavior, interests and needs. 
Nowadays, we call it Big Data. These companies are the recognized leaders in the world’s 
marketing and commerce.

Obviously, if any company wants to increase its performance, the development and integration of 
technologies collecting, processing and analyzing their customers’ data are a must.

The CREDEROOM project will have an advantage, as it will have 
an access to customers’ financial information!

To create all-in-one technology that could rate the success of marketing, evaluate credit score and 
provide a customer with the best offer… well, that would not be enough. To add the identification 
to third-party services, credit history and rating registry, marketing tools for bad debt recovery – all 
EU-wide… still this is not all. The full list will be published on our website upon development.

Let us guide you through the new world of fintech!

Customer Interaction
We believe that successful business in digital age should focus all its efforts on going online. We 
think that time when customer should come to financial institution to get a loan are gone. Going 
online for financial institution is not an easy task, security should be concerned first. 

The company must be sure that client is properly identified and there 
was no identity theft. This is why we developed special procedure for 
Initial Customer Identification and we will briefly explain it. Interaction 
starts when customer sign up on CREDEROOM website or 
smartphone app. Smartphone app will be free and available for iOS, 
Android and Windows.

For customer email verification common verification procedure 
is implemented. Email we are sending email with unique link 
back to our website to customer’s mailbox and only person who 
have access to mailbox will be able to click it.

For customer mobile phone verification SMS code is sent to customer 
and should be entered on CREDEROOM website or in smartphone 
app. For security reasons customer’s mobile phone IMSI is collected 
and stored, trusted third-party HLR-lookup service is used.  The 
common practice is to assume that access to mobile phone is secured 
by owner himself.

Previous steps are very popular in the Internet, but could be tricked 
easily. This is not enough for financial institution and we have next 
step. Customer should upload ID and Proof of Address. Our 
OpenCV based software process uploaded documents and 
compare it with data provided by customer, publicly available data 

and data from closed registers. It also detects and save customer photo from ID for further 
analysis. 

If automated check fails or fraud detected request will be forwarded 
to manual check. Credit score officer will take steps to 
identifycustomer, including making video call with customer or 
arranging personal interview in our office if high risk is detected.

Customer’s bank account verification should be done. Loan can only be deposited on customer’s 
bank account; no third-party’s bank accounts are allowed. Banks are known for strong security 
and customer verification and we can assume that customer is in full 
control of bank account and rely on information received along with 
payment. For this verification customer is asked to make one-time 
payment of 0.01 EUR (or his country currency) to CREDEROOM 
account. Automated check compare data provided with data in 
CREDEROOM bank account statement. 

Customer job and income verification will vary for different EU states. 
Automated verification is possible if there are government maintained 
online registers of current job and taxes paid are available in some 
states. Manual verification if no registers are available, can include 
uploading Certificate of Employment issued by employer or direct 
contact to employer.

 

After initial verification customer will have access to Front-end web 
application and smartphone apps and will be able to enter his 

personal profile section.

CREDEROOM is lending company and after processing customer’s data there will 
be possible loan amount and conditions available in customer’s profile. Customers 
will be “one-click away” to get a loan deposited in his bank account.  

Full history of loans taken and paid will be available in customer’s profile. Full list of 
all collected sensible data will be available in profile for editing, adding or deleting.

The amount of current loan, its APR, the amount to be paid for 
current loan, payment date and payment instruction will be 
available and integrated with client’s internet banking for direct 
payment (if available from customer’s bank). 

Contacts of personal credit officer will be available in personal 
profile. Customer will be able to select his preferred method of 
communication: direct phone call, call back, email or messaging 
with most of popular messengers. 

Interest rates will be calculated for each customer, depending 
on our analytics. Still customer will be able to lower it, by 
installing smartphone app, giving permissions to direct 
marketing and some other actions.

Profile and customer security and protection

Owning profile at CREDEROOM is contract between customer 
and company. That’s why security is our first concern and all 
efforts will be made by CREDEROOM to protect customer from 
maleficent actions of third-parties and customers will also be 
encouraged to protect their profile and informed how to do it. 
Security measures used by customer also will be rewarded with 
lower interest rate.

2FA will be used for authentication and getting loan: SMS and 
software token Time-based One-Time passwords.

Biometric verification will be used in smartphone apps (if 
available).
Connection data, like IP, IMSI, IMEI, and browser fingerprints will 
be monitored to protect customer.

We will use SSL for protection of network connection, but we have 
to take in consideration that it is common to use public or 
corporate networks nowadays.  We believe Emercoin based 
EMCSSL technology provide better protection. EMCSSL does not 
permit MITM-attacks, since the server checks on the Emercoin 
Blockchain whether it is a real certificate from the client, or fake. In 
smartphone apps we develop EMCSSL will be integrated by 
default, but for Front-end application and browsers there will be 
optional support of EMCSSL. 

Customer’s bank account should be verified before for getting loan. This verification will be used 
each time customer changes his account. Only accounts owned by customer and with his name 
will be accepted. 

Customers cooling off period will be defined: customer can return 
loan without penalty and interests for some period. This customer 
protection will be implemented as addition and will not limit any 
customer rights in his respective state.

Analytics, The Heart of CREDEROOM 

By the nature of lending business CREDEROOM will constantly collect and update customer’s 
data. On the other hand, lending is risky business and every company in this area try to minimize 
risks. Using our analytics on collected data, modern methods of communication and marketing, it 
is possible to boost company’s performance greatly. 

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic. Sir Arthur C. Clark.

Yes, when we speak about prediction magic is the first that come in mind. And yet, there are only 
math, statistics and technologies. Let’s take a closer look at it.

Analytics refers to the skills, technologies, applications and practices for continuous iterative 
exploration and investigation of data to gain insight and drive business planning. Analytics 
consists of two major areas: Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics.

Business Intelligence – traditionally focuses on using 
consistent set of metrics to measure past performance 
and guide business planning. Business Intelligence 
consists of querying, reporting, OLAP and can answer 
questions including “what happened”, “how many” and 
“how often”.

Advanced Analytics – goes beyond Business Intelligence 
by using sophisticated modeling techniques to predict 
future events or discover patterns cannot be discovered 
otherwise. Advanced Analytics can answer questions 
including “why is this happening”, “what if these trends 
continue”, “what will happen next” (prediction), “what is the 
best can happen” (optimization). 

Internet Marketing

Using our Predictive Analytics technologies, it is possible 
to identify the most effective combination of product, 
marketing material, communication channels and timing 
that should be used to target given customer. 

Customer retention
With the number of competing services available, 
businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous 
customer satisfaction, rewarding consumer loyalty and 
minimizing customer attrition. Small increases in customer 
retention have been shown to increase profits 
disproportionately. Some studies conclude that a 5% 
increase in customer retention rates can increase profits by 
50%. Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a 

reactive basis, acting only after the customer has 
initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, 
the chance of changing the customer's decision is 
almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics 
can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a 
frequent examination of a customer's past service 
usage, service performance, spending and other 
behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the 
likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime 
soon.

Collection Analytics 

Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do 
not make their payments on time. The financial institution has 
to undertake collection activities on these customers to 
recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are 
wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to 
recover.
 

Predictive Analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the 
most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each 
customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs. 

Predictive Analytics also allow us predict two steps 
ahead. We can calculate cost-benefit ratio for possible 
customer with low credit score before loan issue, 
including higher interest rate, possible late payment fee 
and collection costs. 

Fraud detection
Lending business is very sensitive to fraud. Inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent 
transactions, identity thieves. These problems plague companies in this business. Our predictive 
modeling will be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates and fraudulent transactions.

The source of fraud can also be inside the company from it’s employees. Monitoring and 
predicting transactions for each credit officer will help eliminate this risk.

Analytics and ICO
We develop Predictive Analytics tools for business and most of them is complementing each 
other: by processing customer’s data we are able close to real-time monitor each customer credit 
score, effectiveness of marketing and communication with them and cost-benefit ratio. 

As was said in the beginning we have good investment offer from partner bank. This is why we 
can’t set all of our already developed products to open source. If the ICO Campaign will 
fail, we will accept investment offer and these products will become proprietary. If the ICO 
Campaign will succeed we will be able to open it to public, except products critical to our security.

Other Software and Technologies
Web-tracking and Web-analytics
We did deep research of both proprietary and open source 
projects and found Open Web Analytics4 and Piwik5 are well 
developed projects. Our software engineers will participate in 
development of these tool in original projects. 

On top of these tools we will build tracking and web-analytics as stand-alone 
web-product. 

Development of the Front-End and Back-end applications
We use an open source PHP framework Laravel6 recognized 
as the best PHP framework in the world, for many years. Our 
software engineers develop our applications and will 
participate in the Laravel open-source community as well.

Smartphone apps development
It is hard to imagine a modern company without a smartphone 
app. We will develop smartphone apps for Android, iOS and 
Windows. 

Customer will be able to request a loan to be credited to their bank account in 
one click. Smartphone apps will be secured to prevent misuse or fraud.

Databases, decentralized technologies and security
Information security is of critical importance for financial 
institutions. The data require highly secure and redundant 
storage that would also allow private access and exchange of 
the information between CREDEROOM, its customers, 

partners and law organizations. 

Most banks and financial institutions use Oracle as the software 
for databases. We will be conservative here and will use Oracle 
too, while for some application it will be possible to use a mix of 
several software products. 

EmerCoin7 blockchain technology will be adopted to several 
applications: 

Multi-level permission-based access to data using EMCSSL
Sensitive personal data will require the company to protect it from 
unauthorized access and, at the same time, to grant the multi-level access to 
it for the CREDEROOM staff and partners. 

The advantage provided by the blockchain 
technology comes from the complete 
decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a 
group of servers running under a single 
authorization.

Due to this decentralization, it is not possible 
for technologies based on blockchain to suffer 
from the system-wide service disruption, either 
due to technical failure or malicious attack 
upon authorization servers. 

Multi-purpose Distributed Security Logging on EMCTTS
By its nature, the well-being of CREDEROOM as a financial institution is highly dependable on the 
security of transactions. Logging the actions in IT is a common practice. Emercoin provides a 
universal, extensible service to store and maintain name->value pairs without imposing a narrow 
specialization. We will make logging for financial transactions, like loan approval too. 
 
Inventing the combined logging of IT actions, physical access control, customers’ contacts and 
electronic document signing on distributed blockchain basis will definitely increase the company’s 
security and validity of decisions taken by staff on all levels.

Data Integrity Blockchain
Any stored data is vulnerable to tampering. Storing the non-reversible signature of data to 
blockchain and then verifying it will help to reduce business risks of tampering with the data.

This technology will be adopted in many key areas, such as the registry of the customers’ credit 
history and the storage of documents.

 
Access control

A mix of technologies will be used to grant and track employees’ actions:

RFID for physical access to corporate the infrastructure and office space will be 
implemented;

Time-Based One-Time password hardware tokens and the appropriate software 
will be used for the access to the IT infrastructure and signing the documents;

EMCSSL technology will be adopted to authorize devices, workstations, 
smartphones, tablets, custom IP-devices, both company’s and customers’ access. 
This will include company’s smartphone apps that we will develop for the 
customers, mixing use of SSL-certificates, pin-code, biometrics and IMSI. 

Communication technologies
Modern technologies allow integrate most communications into 
one. The use of communication will consist of internal 
communication with developers outside the EU on the national, 
EU-wide and the international levels.

Communication technologies, like messengers, allow interacting 
with customers also for marketing purpose.

We will build complex solution based on Asterisk IP-PBX and 
third-party services, like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram and 
many others.

We have described only a small part of the software and technologies we will develop and 
integrate into our company. We do not tend to describe here the regular business software, such 
as mail servers, firewalls, VPN and encrypting software.

All data collected by CREDEROOM will be used according to the EU and national legislations. Good practice politics will be developed and published to protect 
customers’ rights. 

Related Activity
Сustomer Identification and Credit Rating Agancy.
As it was described before, a lot of the customers’ data will be collected, including personal data, 
banking accounts data, money flow, credit history and credit score.

We will mostly use this data for the company’s operation. Still this can be implemented as a 
stand-alone EU-wide Credit Rating Agency providing service for third-parties. 

If the decision to implement Credit Rating Agency is taken, a subsidiary company will be 
incorporated into this business. This company will benefit to the profit of the Main company.

Currently, the European Union legislative package on Credit Rating Agencies consists of the 
regulation No 462/2013 and the directive 2013/14/EU. 

Bad Debts Collection

We believe that bad debts are not money losses, but opportunities to increase profit. This is why 
we have developed the bad debts collection strategy which will comprise the following:

pay date delay fine;
new pay date negotiation (will include fine and interests);
pre-trial recovery company incorporation (customer pays expenses for recovery);
debt collection lawsuits;
adding debt data to our own credit history registry and to third-party registries;
selling bad debts with discount;
using our marketing technologies for the recovery of bad debts. 

To collect the bad debts, the Legal department will be created at the 
starting point of the CREDEROOM project. A stand-alone Collection 
Agency will be incorporated as a subsidiary company, at some stage, 
and all activity on debt collection will be transferred there. This 
company will benefit to profit of the Main company.
Currently, debt collection business is regulated by the national 
legislation and the EU “Late Payment Directive” 2011/7/EU.

Tracking and Analytics

We will develop and run as a stand-alone tracking and analytics 
service for third parties, based on the data collected by our company 
from different sources. 

This service will provide the anonymized and aggregated targeting 
information about website users to third parties in order to enhance 
the use of the third-parties services or to provide products and 
services tailored for each customer.

For advertising reason, CREDEROOM will implement a new or will partner with an existing CPA 
network. Third parties that use this CPA network will be able to target their advertising by using 
anonymized and aggregated targeting information from our company.

This activity will be in strict accordance with the EU legislation and CREDEROOM Good Practice 
Statement. A subsidiary company can be incorporated into this business and will benefit to profit 
of the Main Company. 
 
Open Source

We believe in the open source community. We believe that 
technologies and software once created should be available to the 
public. It is the most important reason why we go on ICO instead of 
being financed by a bank.

We see the benefits to our service from the open source approach, e.g., higher security checked 
by many professionals, rich choice of products and technologies to choose from, and high-ranked 
experts.

We would like to be useful to open source community, too. That is why we will try to open all of 
our technologies to public, as long as it does not compromise our business security. 

We will allow all of our software and technology developers to use some of their work time to 
contribute to open-source projects we use. 

ICO Campaign Goals
During the ICO Campaign we would like to reach the following goals and will lead our business 
according to the reached goals:

If the ICO Campaign fails to reach its first goal, all money aggregated during ICO will be sent back 
to its original owners.

CREDEROOM plan to develop and lead its business as EU Wide Company whether, during the 
ICO Campaign, all the goals are reached or not. If all ICO Campaign’s goals have not been 
reached, the terms of development will be different and will be announced separately.

CDRT Token Price during ICO Campaign
The nominal price of 1 CDRT token is set to 1 EUR.

Bonus Tokens
Early token buyers will receive bonus tokens:

pre-ICO - by request

1-3 days –  +20% bonus tokens

4-7 days – +15% bonus tokens

2 week – +10% bonus tokens

3 week – +5% bonus tokens

4 week – 0% bonus tokens

The CDRT Tokens will be sent to Ethereum address they were bought from, or to the 
Ethereum address provided at check-out. Users who wish to acquire  CDRT Tokens must 
provide Ethereum Wallet for which they control the private key. 

The CDRT Tokens can be bought for Ethereum, Bitcoin, LiteCoin, ZCash, DASH and many 
others. Every cryptocurrency will be converted to Ethereum according to exchange rate at 
https://www.coingecko.com crypto exchange.  

In some cases, for sending CDRT Tokens, the identification of the buyer will be required. This will 
not be used for any other purpose.

Value of CDRT Tokens after ICO
All money aggregated during the ICO Campaign will be spent on starting the CREDEROOM 
project: on software and technology development, on incorporation of the companies and 
applying for licenses, on HR Campaigns and other project expenses. We are thankful to all 
owners of the CDRT Tokens and would like to do everything that depends on us to insure that the 
owners of the CDRT Tokens benefit from our future success.

We will make everything possible to ensure that the value of the 
CDRT Tokens will rise, for the benefit of both the existing owners of 
the CDRT Tokens and their potential buyers. We will make, but not 
limit ourselves to, the following steps:

The total quantity of the CDRT Tokens available for ICO is fixed to 50.000.000 (Fifty million). The 
total final quantity of CDRT Tokens will be fixed at 23:59 (UTC+2) on 15 November 2017. The final 
quantity will include the tokens bought during the ICO Campaign, the 5% Founders and Team’s 
tokens and the 2% Bounty Campaign tokens. Additional CDRT Tokens will not be emitted, and if 
there are excess tokens left, they will be destroyed.

We will do our best to list the CDRT Tokens on crypto exchanges, so the owners could freely buy 
and sell the CDRT Tokens for crypto currency. The market will determine the price of the CDRT 
Tokens, and the success of the companies will be reflected by it.

The Team and Founders’ CDRT Tokens will be locked for selling by 
a smart contract for 1 year after the ICO Campaign. This way we will 
motivate ourselves to work hard for the future of our company and 
the owners of the CDRT Tokens.

The most important thing for any business is profit. We will do our best to make the project 
profitable as soon as possible. We will be publishing the CREDEROOM financial report on our 
website every year.

Reward Campaigns
One year after the end of the ICO Campaign, we will start two Reward Campaigns: The Profit 
Equivalent Campaign and the Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Tokens Buyback Campaign.

Every year, on 15 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 10% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be used to buy the CDRT Tokens back from the market at 
the current price. The quantity of the CDRT Tokens that should be bought back will 
be determined every year by taking in consideration the price and availability on the 
market.

All the CDRT Tokens CREDEROOM will buy under the Buyback Campaign will be 
seized and destroyed on the day of purchase. The decrease in the quantity of the 
CDRT Tokens will raise the value of the remaining CDRT Tokens.
  
As long as the CDRT Tokens exist, the Buyback Campaign will be held. Higher price of the CDRT 
Tokens will mean that the Buyback Campaign will be held longer. 

In case the CDRT Tokens still exist but there is lack of offer to buy on the market, 
the crypto currency reserved for this Campaign will be moved to a special fund until 
there is an offer of the CDRT Tokens on the market. CREDEROOM can decide to 
invest this special fund for profit and this profit, except for the expenses, will also be 
added to the special fund. 

This Campaign is optional and the owners of the CDRT Tokens have the full right to sell the tokens 
back or keep it at they will. 

Profit Equivalent Campaign
Every year, on 10 October, CREDEROOM will buy or in another way acquire crypto 
currency Ethereum in the quantity equivalent to 20% of the profit* earned during last 
financial year and not directly reinvested in growth and expansion. 

This crypto currency will be proportionally divided between the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens. For execution of this Campaign, CREDEROOM will create an Ethereum 
address and a Smart Contract. A snapshot of the current owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will be taken from the Ethereum Blockchain and the crypto currency will be 
sent to the appropriate Ethereum addresses.

This Reward Campaign will be held by CREDEROOM until the CDRT Tokens exist and will not 
depend on the quantity of the CDRT Tokens. The process of decreasing the quantity of the CDRT 
Tokens will proportionally increase a share of the reward obtained by each owner of the tokens.

* Profit in this document means the future net profit of the Main Company that will be incorporated after ICO Campaign according 
to Roadmap. Although the Reward Campaigns will depend directly on the profit of the Main Company, the owners of the CDRT 
Tokens will not have any rights to have any part of this profit. The owners of the tokens are fully responsible for taxes related to 
the Reward Campaigns that might need to be paid in their jurisdictions.
