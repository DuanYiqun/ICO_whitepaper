4. SOLUTIONS

4.1 OVERVIEW OF THE CENTRA CARD & WALLET 

Our mission to connect the world and cryptocurrency is fulfilled with our invention of the Centra Card 
and Centra Wallet. 

Just like it is done in conventional banks and debit card, Centra Tech is making all Blockchain 
assets spendable in real time via the Centra Wallet & Centra Card. Our most prominent milestone has 
been the establishment of a global method of banking that is accessible around the world for users to have 
the capacity to spend & store cryptocurrencies. 

The Centra Card will connect to the Centra Wallet, which permits storage of Ethereum, Bitcoin, Centra, 
Dash, Litecoin, Ripple, Zcash, Manero, and more with additional assets being included in the near future. 

The Centra Wallet App permits the secure hosting of multi-blockchain assets while making the assets 
spendable through customers' smartphone or Centra Cards. 

4.2 CENTRA WALLET 

A multi-asset Blockchain Wallet Network with a full-spectrum of services.

The first step in creating a global account is to download the Centra Wallet application, which will be 
accessible in the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, and soon, on desktop/web. 

Once the client, who will be addressed as "user", has installed the Centra WalletApp, they will enter 
theiressential information. For example, name, phone number, email address, home address, birth 
date, national ID#, and a password, to create an account. 

After the user has created an account, a multi-blockchain wallet will be automatically created after our system 
passes a Identity Verification/KYC check. The funds that are associated with the Centra Wallet account 
holders will be stored safely by means of an industry-approved hot and cold storage solution. These assets 
will be guaranteed from employee theft & network hackers, giving 
users peace of mind. 

Once a customer has assets in the Centra Wallet, they can be securely stored, transferred, or spend via the 
Centra Wallet App or the Centra Card. The user has the ability to select a default currency at any time. A 
user can likewise withdraw blockchain assets to transfer them to another Centra wallet without dealing with 
any exchange fees at any time. Users will also be able to use the in-app Exchange feature to Swap 
their cryptourrency with another coin/token through our integrations of the Changelly platform. Users will also 
have the ability to send invoices to others to collect payment remittances via cryptocurrenciies. We are 
also integrating a "Store" feature in the CEntra Wallet where users can sell items to be paid via 
cryptocurrencies all through the in-app wallet. 



4.3 CENTRA CARD 

A card that allows users to spend their digital assets in real time that accepts a major card carrier 
network. 

To order a Centra Card, the user can place the request directly inside the Centra Wallet App or Centra Tech 
website. All Centra Cards issued will be connected to CCE and Centra Wallet. Clients will have the 
ability to order a virtual card and/or a physical card. 

Using Centra Tech's CCE Module, Centra Card enables all supported cryptocurrencies to become 
spendable in real-time, in view of the government fiat being used at the time the card is used at a 
participating location. 



4.4 CENTRA CTK 

The Centra Tool Kit has been designed to create the next level of integration and scaling of our services to a 
worldwide audience. The CTK will allow coin companies and exchanges to partner with Centra in order to 
carry a wide array of services all built into our network. 

Utilizing CTK we will be offering white label service products for Exchanges to create a branded card where 
their users will be able to spend digital assets held by the exchanges in real time utilizing the CCE via our 
CTK. This gives a robust API service to connect to our liquidty fiat pool to be able to make transactional 
purchases at point of sale and spending their digital assets while doing so. 

Coin Companies would be able to utilize our CTK API to create their own standalone wallet and provide a 
branded card for their usersto make their digital assets spendable. 

We have shifted our focus to making the CTK a platform for users to utilize our APl's to create these 
applications while being able to stay compliant with KYC/AML regulations as all users that are created via the 
CTK will go through those channels of verification. The CTK also creates the bridge to allow any partnered 
company access to tools necessary to create a commerce based cryptocurrency-to-fiat system. 

The CTK will be a growing tools with more features being added as time progresses. We have more 
documentations available on this once a partner program has been enrolled.
