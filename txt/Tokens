White Paper www.tokens.net3

Background

My name is Damian Merlak and I am the leading architect and founder of 
the Tokens trading platform. 

I was introduced to computer programming in primary school at the age of 13 and I 
have been hooked ever since. I started developing web applications professionally in 
2004. Besides technology, I have always had a great interest in finance and investing, 
so I spent a lot of my free time trading and investing the money I earned from my 
software projects.

At the beginning of 2011, something happened which completely changed the course 
of my life. I discovered Bitcoin. At the time, the price was fluctuating between $1 and 
$2, and the financial part of my brain was immediately captivated. I became interested 
and bought some. Soon after that, the first “bubble” happened and the price soared to 
$30.

In the meantime, my technological part wanted to explore the technology a bit more. 
It drove me to build a small bitcoin mining operation in my basement. I immediately 
went to buy the cheapest CPU and motherboard available, along with the best 
graphics card money could buy at the time. Of course, this illogical computer 
configuration caught the attention of the local store owner, so I had to explain why and 
how I was going to use it. I started explaining everything I knew about Bitcoin, and we 
ended up becoming friends.

Soon after that, the two of us decided to create a bitcoin business together. A few 
months later, we had a working exchange ready to be launched under the name 
Bitstamp. It was by far the most professional place to trade bitcoin at the time and 
after the fall of Mt. Gox, became the largest bitcoin exchange in the world. Today, 
Bitstamp is still one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with over $1 
billion of monthly trading volume. 

Since 2011, the cryptocurrency space has evolved, while most cryptocurrency 
businesses aren’t keeping up with the latest trends.

Solution

Our solution is a next generation cryptocurrency trading 

platform, introducing Dynamic Trading Rights (DTR) to 

revolutionise the current trading environment by 

providing a trustworthy, transparent, safe, and reliable 

place to exchange ERC20 tokens and other cryptocur-

rencies that are foreseen to evolve in the future.

Our token trading platform also introduces DTR Voice. 

The community will be periodically consulted about our 

future decisions regarding both future trading pair 

listings and other decisions that would contribute to the 

user experience.

White Paper www.tokens.net6

Right now, crypto/crypto trading represents 23% of all cryptocurrency trading

in the world. We believe this share will grow substantially in the near future as

bitcoin becomes a reserve currency of the crypto economy, and most trading will

be done between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If we exclude all other trading pairs and only focus on bitcoin trading against other

cryptocurrencies, the numbers start to support our predictions even more. Looking

only at bitcoin volumes, 43% of all trading around the globe is already done against 

other cryptocurrencies and only 57% is traded against fiat currencies. We believe this 

trend will only intensify over time, and fiat trading will soon represent less than half of 

all trading volume.

Based on current market data, we have predicted our earnings in the first year of

operations. We have based our calculation on the assumption that we will take

over 2.5% of the world’s crypto/crypto trading volume.

Based on today’s figures we estimate:

• An annual market volume of $1,920 billion

• 25% crypto/crypto market share

• 2.5% Tokens platform global trading participation

• An average platform transaction fee of 0.15% (0.075% buyer/seller direction) 

TOTAL annual fee income of $18 million.

White Paper www.tokens.net9

We will fund the development of our Tokens platform by selling vouchers for all our 

future trading fees to our ICO backers. Vouchers will be sold in the form of future 

trading rights and will be represented by an ERC20 token created under the ticker 

DTR.

DTR tokens will represent a right to make a trade on our Tokens platform on any

currency pair listed at any time in the future. The amount of trading you will be

able to fund using a single token will be dynamically set, based on the market

price of DTR at the moment of the trade. A transaction for a DTR holder will be

charged at the best ask price, ignoring the market depth. This favours buying

DTR tokens in advance even more.

However, there will be no need to own DTR in advance or even be aware of the

fact that transaction fees are payable in DTR, as any client not owning DTR will

be charged a fee in the currency they are trading in. Conversion of the fee cost

into DTR will be executed automatically and clients owning DTR will have their

DTR subtracted from their balance, based on the DTR’s market value.

DTR used for trading will be burned on the Ethereum network using a smart contract 

designed to destroy tokens on a regular basis.

If a client makes a trade without having any DTR, the fee will be charged in a

currency they are currently trading with, and converted into DTR tokens in the

background.

White Paper www.tokens.net10

Example 1:

A trader buys 0.1 BTC and the commission for the trade is 0.20%. 
The DTR price at that moment is 0.00022 BTC.

First we calculate the fee in BTC:

Second we convert that to DTR:

In the above case a trader would pay 0.90 DTR for buying 0.1 BTC.

Example 2:

A trader buys 0.1 BTC again and the commission for the trade is still 
0.20%, but the DTR price rose and is now worth 0.00030 BTC.

We calculate the fee in BTC:

And convert that to DTR:

Now a trader would only pay 0.66 DTR for buying the same amount 

of BTC.

This process will create a frictionless user experience for users who do not want to 

deal with our Dynamic Trading Rights tokens. That said, there will be an incentive for 

our clients to buy our tokens in advance and burn them for trading, as the following 

examples clearly show:



White Paper www.tokens.net11

The above examples show how a smart trader may benefit by locking in inexpensive 

DTR and holding them for future fee exchange when DTR increase in value. A smart 

trader would still be subject to regularly payable fees, but their effective fee cost 

would be substantially lower, due to a cheaper DTR stock value than that of a peer 

trader who does not own DTR at the time of trade.

Since every trade on our platform will burn a certain amount of DTR, the daily volume 

on our platform will have to match the amount of tokens burned every single day. This 

will make Tokens the most transparent cryptocurrency trading platform in the world. 

There will be no way of cheating and artificially boosting the volume on any trading 

pair available.

Since trading fees are payable in DTR, a user may reduce their stock by two options: 

either by inserting a sell order and waiting for an automatic conversion to set against 

it, or by trading, as DTR are subtracted as payable fees. These two DTR features make 

the Tokens platform unique in providing constant liquidity and an automatic offset.

DTR Liquidity



White Paper www.tokens.net13

Tokens platform shall periodically ask community for future decision endorsements, 

either for the platform to decide on future crypto/crypto pair listings or other decisions 

that would contribute to user experience. For this purpose the platform will organize 

votings where DTR will be committed as voting ballots. More DTR tokens will be 

committed, more voting power will be given to their decisions.

This voting shall be for guidance purpose only and not binding nor mandatory for 

Tokens platform. 

DTR Voice



White Paper www.tokens.net14

The majority of DTR tokens, 40% will be proportionally distributed among
ICO backers.

30% will be reserved for team members and future employees. The team will have 4 

years vesting and 1 year cliff.

30% will rest with the company. Should the ICO money run out, the platform must 

not discontinue. To solve this problem, the company will liquidate small amounts of 

tokens to fund operations.

When we collect the equivalent of $15m USD, the ICO will close at that moment and 

no additional funds will be accepted. The ICO will last for 30 days at most.

Since we will be accepting different currencies, we will evaluate all our ICO income 

at the time of token purchase. That means a buyer of our tokens in the ICO period will 

get the exact amount of tokens that their bitcoins, ether or ripples will be worth at the 

time of transaction. Bitstamp exchange rates will be used.

DTR token distribution will be provided in 7 days after ICO completion, taking all 

checks and safeguards into account.

ICO backers are not entitled to any refunds.
