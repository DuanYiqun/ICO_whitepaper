Any app can launch branded tokens on open scalable side-chains, powered by  
Simple Token, a protocol for consumer-app tokenization and an ERC-20 utility token.

4

On 14 November we are launching 
Simple Token to empower an ecosystem 
and to finance further development.



Executive Summary 
A protocol for consumer-app tokenization powered by a blockchain and a utility token.

• What. Technologies that companies can use to design, launch, and manage their own branded tokens powered by 
Simple Token, a protocol and an ERC-20 utility token.   

• Why. Blockchain technologies hold tremendous promise for a new generation of consumer Internet services, but 
blockchain is currently too complex for most consumer apps, too daunting for consumer-facing developers, and 
not currently scalable to millions of end-user micro-transactions without public-private chain innovations. 

• How. The OpenST protocol, available today https://github.com/openstfoundation, enables companies to stake 
Simple Tokens against their own Branded Tokens, minted on open scaleable side blockchains, in a cryptographically 
auditable manner. Developers are building applications on top of OpenST. The Simple Token SaaS platform, under 
development, gives companies the tools to manage, customize, monitor, and analyze their ST-powered token 
economy. 

• Developers. We aim to foster an ecosystem that will take the lead and develop Simple Token protocols on behalf of 
the community. Developers will be encouraged to contribute to the Simple Token project and can earn Simple 
Tokens for their contributions. 

• Team. From the consumer-Internet technology team behind Pepo, Hem, Fab, and Social Median; the lead 
developer of Hyperledger Burrow (Monax); and the Blockchain technology team Enuma (prior work on EOS & 
OpenANX).  

• Token Sale #1: Public sale on 14, November 2017. Total token supply: 800,000,000. 30% of token supply will be 
offered for$20M (hard cap). 27.2% of tokens reserved for a Network Accelerator Program to seed promising 
projects built on Simple Token. 10% advisors, 10% founders, 5.6% early backers (all on longterm vesting schedules). 
12.6% reserved for future token sales. Pre-sale underway as of 5 September, 2017, $200K minimum for pre-sale.

Cryptocurrency Landscape 
Public Ethereum Is Not Yet Capable of Supporting Consumer Micro-Transactions

• A new app like Pepo would account for nearly 1% of the maximum number of daily Ethereum transactions.  
• One medium-sized app like Unsplash (330M monthly API calls) would overwhelm Ethereum entirely. 
• The median Ethereum transaction cost is $0.12 per transaction — not viable for consumer micro-transactions.

Cryptocurrency Landscape 
Some Real-Life Consumer Use Cases for Tokenization & Blockchain Technology



Consumer Business

An Ethereum Token
could help solve this!

• Disrupt incumbents
• Reduce value leakage to
 Facebook, Google, Apple

WANTS

• Engagement
• Growth 
• Monetization

NEEDS

CAUTION!
BUT

AHA!

Tokenization is Hard,
and not Consumer App

Plug-n-Play

• Incentivize users
• Reward value creation
• Monetize micro-transactions
• Decentralize
• Link value realization to value creation
• Interoperability to other services

• High costs: >$500K to ICO (legal, tax, 
advisory)

• High effort & complexity: not core com-
petency

• High risk:  legal, regulatory, tax, security, 
fraud

• High technology constraints: No existing 
consumer protocols, Ethereum is not 
ready for high volume, high transaction 
costs, challenging user experiences

Consumer Apps Need A Bridge To Crypto

The Simple Token Protocol

Simple Token 
Protocol 

• Member companies' branded tokens live on a 
scalable open Side-chain. 

• Branded tokens are “mined” by staking ST 
and/or collateralized crypto-assets. 

• All branded token transactions live on the 
open Side-chain.

Performant  
Ethereum 

Ledger 

TBD: Parity, 
Ethermint, 

Hyperledger Burrow 

The Simple Token Open Side-chain is validated by Simple Token Foundation, Simple Token Company, and member 
companies. Anyone can send transactions to the Side-chain, and anyone can verify it. To ensure immutability of the Side-
chain, the state root is regularly anchored in a Simple Token smart contract on public Ethereum.

Freely Tradable 
ERC-20 Token

Simple Token

• Simple Token Protocol allows staking of crypto-
assets on public Ethereum to mint Branded Token 
on Sidechain  

• Simple Token Protocol uses merkle proofs and 
signed receipts to ensure atomic and 
cryptographically secured transfer of usable value 
between Ethereum and the SImple Token Sidechain 

• Simple Token Protocol keeps all valuable crypto-
assets on Ethereum, and they can be recovered in 
case of proven Byzantine behaviour on the Simple 
Token Sidechain

• We define Simple Token Side-chain to be open because anyone can formulate a transaction and a 
transaction is valid or invalid in its own right. The Side-chain is validated not just by the Foundation 
and the Simple Token Company, but also by the member companies. 

• To ensure that no-one can attempt to rewrite the block history of the Simple Token Side-chain, the 
Foundation will submit the hash of the latest block height to a contract on public Ethereum. 

• Smart contracts for the member companies’ branded tokens and all their transactions will be 
executed on the open Side-chain. This makes privacy of the users, security, scalability, and 
performance important considerations when evaluating the right blockchain technology for Simple 
Token’s needs. 

• To protect the privacy of the users of the services of the member companies on inherently public 
networks, we will work closely with member companies to ensure that no personally identifiable 
information is stored on the Side-chain. We do this out of respect for our users, conviction for what is 
right, and to comply with data protection regulations.  

• For the initial test phase, we will also test on a private version of native Ethereum (Proof-of-Authority) 
to separate the core competency of Simple Token from the evaluation of and contributions to the 
most suited platform to execute Simple Token on.

• Simple Token is on the public Ethereum blockchain while 
the Member Companies are all within a highly scalable 
open Side-chain. 

• ST is a freely floated ERC-20 token, while the Member 
Companies’ branded tokens are not floated. 

• In Phase 1 all Member Company in-app transactions 
happen within their own communities.  

• Notably, the Simple Token solution enables companies to 
obtain Blockchain benefits without requiring their entire 
business to be on a blockchain. 

• As Simple Token evolves and as Ethereum evolves and improves: 
• Interoperability across the Simple Token network with a common Simple Token 

wallet and interoperable services. 
• Interoperability with the broader Ethereum universe. 

• Successful Member Companies with proven market liquidity could spin out of the Simple 
Token Side-chain and float their own token in ICO events.

• One concern of consumer-facing companies considering tokenization is exposing their users to wild price fluctuations as currently experienced 
with crypto currencies.  

• Negative fluctuations could hamper users’ faith in the economy and create challenging user experiences (i.e. if a user earns $100 worth of a 
token for selling a real-world service only to have that drop to $20). 

• Positive appreciation could drive consumers to cash out and / or hoard the currency. 
• To mitigate this, 3rd party companies are exploring providing price stabilization-as-a-service of Branded Tokens to Member Companies. To achieve 

this, rather than staking Simple Tokens against Branded Tokens, a basket of non-correlated and less volatile assets could be staked against the 
Member Company’s Branded Tokens. The potential roadmap conceptualizes that this service could also be provided in a decentralized fashion by 
other holders of Simple Token 

• Any appreciation in the basket of crypto-assets could be captured as profit (sell off excess crypto-assets), while depreciation would need to be 
addressed by loading more crypto-assets into the collateral address.

The Simple Token Platform 
Price Stabilization (Conceptual Concepts, Could be Provided by 3rd Parties)

In this example, the project selects a maximum of 10% 
price appreciation and minimum of 10% price 
depreciation, creating a band between $1.1 and $.09 
within which the BT fiat price is allowed to fluctuate

When the effective price drops below 10%, the 
company must put new cryptoassets into the 
collateral address—or the smart contract makes a 
capital call on a designated reserve address.

When the effective price drops below 10%, the 
company must put new crypto-assets into the 
collateral address—or the smart contract makes a 
capital call on a designated reserve address.

When the effective price rises above 10%, the 
company has the option of selling their excess 
collateral, because they aren’t needed to 
guarantee the price.

At the end of a designated cycle, 
the company has the option of 
adjusting the base price.

S TABIL IZING THE PRICE OF BRANDED TOKEN

• Early on, companies will be able to attain Simple Tokens by: 

• Buying them outright from the issuers or others.  

• Earning them through valued contributions to the Simple Token mission. Bounties will be established for 
desired projects and offers and submissions will be evaluated by the Foundation.  

• Receiving grants for specific projects.  

• Scaling to hundreds and thousands of Member Companies via Pay-Go Programs .  

• We are exploring various methods for enabling Simple Token Participating Companies to pay monthly 
subscriptions for the amount of tokens being utilized in their networks rather than incurring large 
upfront fees, similar to the popular AWS pay-for-use programs. 

• Such programs could be combined with price stability services and other value added services.  

• In the future other 3rd party companies could also offer such products to Simple Token Participating 
Companies.

• The Foundation's purpose is to promote the real world application of the OpenST protocols and its implementations, 
collectively referred to as “the OpenST Platform” or “the Platform.” It will have its own robust governance model. 

• The Foundation also aims to initially develop the OpenST Platform and advocate governance and transparency for the 
Platform. 

• ST Token holders, Developers, and Member Companies will be empowered to determine the direction of functionality 
and improvement to the Platform and associated ecosystem. 

• The Foundation shall be separate from any for-profit ventures, including the separate for profit Simple Token Company. 
The Foundation shall have an independent Board of Directors of 5 members, with oversight over token supply, token 
distribution, and allocation of Foundation resources. 

• The Foundation shall own the IP for the Platform which enables Simple Tokens to be staked against deploying Branded 
Tokens on side-chains and associated API’s which enable Simple Token-based applications and services. 

• The Foundation shall provide the Platform on an “open source” basis for anyone with a license to study, change, 
distribute, to anyone, for any purpose. However, the Foundation reserves the right to approve Memberships to the 
Platform which are required in order to stake ST against Branded Tokens on the Platform. 

• It is initially conceived that The Foundation shall conduct the following activities: 
• Manage the ST token supply. 
• Manage the Platform development and intellectual property. 
• Allocate Foundation resources. 
• Evaluate and approve memberships. 
• Evaluate and approve ST token grants under the ST Network Accelerator Program. 
• Approve the deployment of branded tokens based on Simple Tokens. 

• The Foundation may take on other activities in the future.

• After the Token Sale 27.2% of Simple Tokens shall be reserved in the Network Accelerator Program.  

• Early on, one of the primary uses of the Network Accelerator Program shall be to provide Simple Tokens as 
grants to Early Adopter Companies to help them kickstart their Simple Token implementations and growth 
of their networks. Early Adopter Companies will help define requirements for the protocol, software, and 
related services, and shall help contribute to the Simple Token open-source protocol.  

• Up to 30% of each Network Accelerator grant may be provided to the project team of the Early Adopter 
Company, under a long-term vesting schedule, to further incentivize the team to create value utilizing 
Simple Token. 

• The Foundation shall review and approve Network Accelerator grant requests and determine the terms and 
conditions of grants. 

• In addition to Pepo who is helping define and develop the Simple Token platform, we are currently 
evaluating several interested Network Accelerator Companies. 

Network Accelerator Program

• OpenST Platform, is the open-source implementation of the OpenST protocol.  Any developer can utilize the OpenST 
Platform to build a software suite of modules, dashboards and applications that enables Member Companies to easily 
integrate with the sidechain and allow their end-consumers to carry out different types of transactions using branded 
tokens on the sidechain. 

• For example, while OpenST publishes the specifications and implements the REST APIs for value transfers between two 
addresses, developers can provide admin dashboards with transaction modules where Member Companies can easily 
configure the types of value transfer transactions that Pepo’s users can perform, like Up Votes etc.  

• Developers can then further offer value added services build on top of the OpenST Platform, for example, end-
consumer’s transaction history, analytics, pay-per-go, price stabilization mechanisms, price oracles etc. 

• In future, we envision the protocol to develop in a way that allows the end-consumers to use Simple Tokens for 
transactions across various Member Companies in a seamless manner. Developers can build wallet services for end-
consumers using such protocol methods. 

• OpenST will also work towards advancing the requirements beneficial to the OpenST Platform, particularly related to 
scalability and privacy. This includes work that contributes to (application-specific) sidechain and payment channel 
technology.

“We began exploring tokenizing the consumer marketplace 
Pepo in 2016. Beyond the enormous costs and regulatory 
cautions involved with launching a blockchain-based token, 
we quickly discovered a huge gap between the promise of 
blockchain technologies and the ability to currently deploy 
tokens within consumer apps. An entire set of B2C-friendly 
protocols needs to be developed in order to bridge the 
gap between crypto and consumer. Rather than wait for 
others to develop it, Simple Token is building that bridge. 

Our team has worked on many high profile and high 
scaling projects. Simple Token is far and away the most 
technologically challenging and greatest impact project 
we’ve ever taken on. ”

“Our team prides itself on consumerizing technology. A 
great recent example is our work with AWS SES. We were 
the first company to create a robust and highly scalable way 
for any company to harness the power of AWS SES without 
writing any code of their own. 

Simple Token presents a similar and exciting challenge: To 
enable any Internet company to easily and safely deploy 
blockchain technology and tokens to their end-users. 

Pepo is excited to be the first customer of Simple Token and
