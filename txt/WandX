WANDX - ERC20 TOKEN
PRODUCTS USING SMART
CONTRACTS

1. Executive summary

As consumer appetite in various classes of assets

have grown over the last half of the 20th century,

methods to derisk a purchaser from speculative

activity has evolved. An ideal example of the need for

this derisking is the tulip mania that overtook modern

day Netherlands in the 17th century. Similarly,

purchasers of wine, paintings, property and stamps,

are vexed with the question of how to ensure that pure

speculation does not negatively affect the price of the

asset that they are buying. Purchasers of

cryptocurrencies face the same problem.

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 2/23

WandX seeks to establish an infrastructure for

decentralized creation and trade of ERC20 Tokens built

on the Ethereum blockchain. The pilot application

allows users to create combinations of ERC20 Tokens

(known as a Basket of Tokens) and trade the Basket by

way of a single transaction.

2. Problem statement

Some of the problems that the WandX platform aims to

solve are:

How can users solve the problem that the price of

any single ERC20 Token is higher than it ought to

be, on account of speculation?

How can users purchase multiple ERC20 Tokens in

a single transaction?

How can users not lose money even if there is a

fall in the price of a single ERC20 Token?

How can users increase the liquidity of single

ERC20 tokens?

How can users create and trade digital assets

(such as loyalty points) recorded on a blockchain?

Many of these problems are currently being solved by

centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto-asset

management platforms. Though popular and easy to

use, many centralized exchanges and asset

management platforms face problems with data

security. They provide a centralized platform for

blockchain assets, which by definition are meant to be

decentralized. Other challenges faced by centralized

exchanges and platforms include low liquidity

thresholds and longer waiting periods for users to

withdraw their funds from these exchanges.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 3/23

3. Solution

WandX aims to solve the above problem by providing a

decentralized platform that enables the creation and

trade of Baskets of ERC20 Tokens through smart

contracts.

Users can trade in Baskets of ERC20 Tokens.

Users can acquire multiple ERC20 Tokens with a

single transaction. The WandX platform does not

hold private keys or any Tokens.

Innovative solutions to sell an ERC20 Token or

Basket that is borrowed are being developed on

WandX.

WandX provides tools to create tokens that can be

backed by a digital asset such as loyalty points,

and these tokens can be traded on our platform.

We are experimenting with a larger number of

trades happening off-chain, and only record the

trades happening on-chain.

Some of the ERC20 Token instruments that can be

created on WandX are as follows:

Baskets of ERC20 Tokens: These are combinations of

ERC20 Tokens can be created with a single

transaction. Users can create a basket of ERC20

Tokens; this Basket has an associated price which is

determined by the underlying ERC20 Tokens in the

Basket. Creation and Trade of this Basket happens by

way of smart contracts.

Issue Crypto-assets: WandX would enable a user to

record his/her digital asset(s) on the blockchain

through a user friendly front-end for creating tokens on

Ethereum. These tokens would then represent

ownership of crypto-asset(s) such as loyalty points



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 4/23

which could be transacted with other users. Such

transactions, along with the decentralized exchange,

could be used to create markets for any crypto-asset.

4. Identity

Although anonymity or pseudonymity is welcome in

certain cases, in the WandX business model it would

benefit the network as well as the users to reveal their

identities or parts of their identities. This would be

done through integration with identification platforms

such as uPort and Civic. WandX enables solving the

information asymmetry problem using the

transparency of the blockchain, but still retaining the

business model and working economics of creating

liquidity of ERC20 Tokens.

5. Technology

From a technology standpoint, WandX is built on the

Ethereum blockchain because of its smart contracting

capabilities, large network of miners and users, and a

large number of tokens already having been issued on

Ethereum. Our initial product will be based on creation

of baskets of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. We have six

types of contracts - data storage (d-gen), functionality

enabler (f-gen), trade enabler (t-gen), settlement

enabler (s-gen), rating enabler (r-gen), and analytics

enabler (a-gen). Together they create a holistic

ecosystem to create, trade, view, and settle contracts.

Issuers create the ERC20 Token instruments, market

makers and buyers purchase these instruments, sellers

close the loop and thus all the players together create

the market for the instrument. Using the f-gen, the

issuer creates the product, the d-gen stores the

product, the t-gen and s-gen are responsible for



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 5/23

decentralized trade of the product through smart

contracts. The r-gen is optional, and can be used only

by certain users to rate products.

[Figure 1. WandX platform architecture]

6. Incentivization

Users of each of the gen modules are incentivized to

contribute to the platform. Incentives of different

players on the WandX platform are slightly different

depending on the value they bring to the platform. All

the incentives are distributed using the Wand token

which is based on Ether. The underlying value of this

Dapp will be in its applications to create, trade and

settle instruments based on ERC20 Tokens. The Token

sale will distribute the Wand tokens among the public,

after which bounty programs will be conducted to

incentivize each player in the platform.

Market maker: Market makers are marketing partners.

Their role is a combination of acting as an issuer and

as a seller. They create a market for products that they

think will sell based on their real-world experience in

various industries. For example, if they think that a

certain basket of five ERC20 Tokens has shown good

returns in the past two years, they would create and

trade this basket on WandX. They would receive Wand

for its creation, and they can specify their trading fees

when they sell the basket.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 6/23

Developers: Benevolent developers are always

welcome! Developers can greatly contribute to the Beta

version of the platform by identifying bugs and

suggesting features, and better yet creating and

pushing the fix.

Hackathons: Virtual hackathons will be held once

during the Beta phase.

Issuer: Issuers are basically creators of the ERC20

Token products.

Sellers: Using the d-gen, f-gen, and the t-gen, sellers

will enhance the liquidity of the various products.

Sellers are the other side of the contract, and help with

price discovery of the basket or asset.

Buyers: Buyers will use the t-gen to trade in the

products given below.

Baskets: These baskets can be traded on the API

and smart contract structure built on WandX.

Bilateral Contracts: Two parties could create a

bilateral contract whose settlement would be done

by the s-gen automatically. This would be a

contract which is executed by the EVM.

A month after our Token launch, we will introduce

bounties for each player in the platform, and for each

type of product that can be created.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 7/23

[Figure 2. WandX platform users and modules]

7. Governance

The point of creating this system of decentralized

ERC20 Token contract settlement on Ethereum is to

allow the system to develop trust amongst different

players. However, adherence to the type of contracts

on the platform can be further enforced using

standardized accounts available on the platform.

Since this platform is developed on the Ethereum

blockchain, the single source of truth of the creation,

trade and settlement of the products is based on the

blockchain. Integrations of uPort and other identity

platforms will serve to increase trust in the system.

8. Timeline

[Figure 3. Roadmap of WandX development and feature

addition for the next 6 months.]

9. Competitor Landscape



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 8/23

Decentralized exchanges: 0x project, Etherdelta

Centralized exchanges: Kraken, Coinbase, Shapeshift

Centralized digital assets trading: Kraken, Poloniex,

Prism (by shapeshift)

Decentralized digital assets trading: Dcorp (Not

released as per the time of writing this), EtherOpt

(Beta)

Our biggest differentiator is that we are creating the

entire infrastructure for decentralized creation and

trade of any ERC20 Token instrument. Managers can

create baskets of ERC20 Tokens or programmes to

diversify such holdings, as well as define rules for

trading these baskets.

Digital assets such as loyalty points can also be traded

on WandX. There are no automated market makers or

price discovery mechanisms, it is an open market to

the gamut of users who would participate and benefit

from this decentralized platform.

10. Technology integrations

10.1 Data from other blockchains and oracles

Using applications such as Oraclize, Streamr, and IPFS,

we are in the process of creating the backend for d-gen

and f-gen to connect and retrieve information from

other blockchains as well as different web APIs. The

users can use these third party applications to retrieve

data which acts as an impartial oracle, required when

blockchains have to interact with data on the web.

These features (or suitable alternatives) would release

on WandX 2.0.

10.2 IoT



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 9/23

In the not so distant future, we shall see machines

interacting with each other through blockchains. We’re

building towards this future. Transactions between IoT

machines ought to be permissible within our

architecture.

10.3 Other platforms

After the release of WandX 1.0, we intend to add an API

which could possibly be used in platforms such as

Gnosis. To verify the identity of different players, we

plan to integrate with identity verification systems such

as uPort. This could be used to verify users’

credentials, past transactions, trustworthiness and to

minimise potential loss.

10.4 Analytics engines

We are working on integrating analytics tools such as

R. This could be used to generate statistical models on

the ERC20 products .

[Figure 4. Different technology integrations into

WandX]

11. Legal considerations



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 10/23

The legal and regulatory environment around token

generation events, cryptocurrencies and crypto-

exchanges are in a state of flux. Our ability to operate

legally in the jurisdictions that we operate in are

subject to these legal and regulatory changes. As such,

we anticipate initiating a continuous channel of

discussion with regulators and to modify our roadmap

and plans depending on these discussions.

The legal considerations of using the WandX platform

is tied to the regulations around cryptocurrencies in

your respective countries. Please read our terms of

use, privacy policy requirements and consult with a

legal expert in your jurisdiction before using the WandX

application or taking part in our token sale.

Each phased plan of implementation will involve a

continuous channel of communication with our

lawyers, with regulators (including but not limited to

the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Securities &

Exchange Commission of the United States and the

Reserve Bank of India). Should either our lawyers or

applicable regulators raise any issue in respect of the

implementation of this roadmap, we will remodel this

roadmap or obtain appropriate approvals.

YOU ARE ASSUMING THE RISK THAT A REGULATOR

WILL IMPOSE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON

WANDX. WANDX WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR

ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO

A LEGAL OR REGULATORY EVENT DESCRIBED ABOVE.

12. Development Roadmap

Pilot: Create, trade, and settle a Basket of ERC20

Tokens. For example, you could create a Basket of five

ERC20 tokens in a given proportion. This Basket can be



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 11/23

traded with buyers who don’t want to go into the

trouble of buying five separate ERC20 Tokens. A

trading fee and a creation fee can be specified at the

time of creation. The buyer can then choose to

liquidate his Basket and get the underlying

cryptocurrencies into his wallet.

Beta: We will release our Beta by 16th September onto

the Ethereum blockchain.

Token sale: We are launching our Token sale on 27th

October. Further details are available in the Token sale

section of the Whitepaper.

WandX 1.0: WandX 1.0 will go live on the Ethereum

mainnet on 20th November.

Pilot across industries: We aim to be a truly

decentralized platform for the creation and trading of

baskets of ERC20 Tokens. We believe in building great

products, but also in creating trustworthy brands. We

plan to pilot our platform on a private Ethereum

network in the telecom sector and carbon credit

trading sector. For applications in industries as

highlighted here, we will create a private network

whose transactions will be pegged to the main-net to

reduce transaction time and transaction costs.

P2P contracts for digital assets: In November, we will

launch the P2P traded baskets and digital assets

market on WandX.

WandX 2.0: This releases in Jan 2018. WandX 2.0 will

be the platform to create and trade any ERC20 Token

instrument.

13. Marketing and sales strategy



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 12/23

Our strategy is aimed toward onboarding a gamut of

user types. We want our users to use our platform as a

tool to understand and explore crypto assets, as a

method to create crypto-assets, and to reduce the risk

of fluctuations in the value of crypto assets.

13.1 Online strategy

Ads: Google and Facebook ads.

Social media: Use social media (Reddit, Twitter,

and Facebook) to spread the word.

Other media: Use medium, Blogs, YouTube videos,

Github, our Slack channel, Reddit, and Telegram to

inform users about our updates and new features.

Videos: Create YouTube videos for instructions on

how to use our platform.

13.2 Offline strategy

Crypto Partners: Partnerships with various players

to make it easy for fast onboarding.

Industry Partners: Partner with industry experts

and fintech startups who can use WandX to

improve efficiencies in their processes. This would

be to integrate off-chain transactions with on-

chain settlements.

Use cases: Create pilot programs of use cases.

Sale bounty: Give out bounties for those who are

willing to be our sales partners to identify and

engage with potential clients.

Advisors: We have a large team of advisors in the

fields of statistics, data analytics, and markets.

14. Token Sale

We are launching the Wand token through a Token sale

on 27th October. The Wand token will be used in the

WandX platform for transacting with any of the WandX



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 13/23

APIs. The first WandX API will be the Olio basket

trading application. This application allows users to

create and trade in a basket of ERC20 tokens. The

latest details of our token sale page will be updated on

our site. Users must closely read the Terms and

Conditions before contribution.

14.1 Why launch a new token instead of just using

Ether?

Governance: Governance over updates to the

software which is separate from the Ethereum

ecosystem.

Incentives: Incentive programs for various users,

bounties for bug identification, and promoting the

use of all the modules of our platform.

Future development: If we decide to integrate the

tokens created on other blockchains as well (such

as Tezos and NEO), we would need to be able to

introduce protocols such as the COMIT protocol

for interaction between the blockchains. It would

be more secure and more efficient to do this if we

have our own token.

Contracts for baskets of crypto assets: Collateral

and margin can be posted in terms of a common

Token whose movement is not directly dependent

on Ether.

Developing the WandX protocol: The Wand token

will be used to access any application on the

WandX platform. The functionality in all

applications is enabled by APIs. When external

applications use any of the WandX APIs, they will

be charged a certain fee in Wand; to use any of the

applications on WandX, users will have to transact

using Wand.

Use cases: To pilot the WandX protocol in the use

cases mentioned here.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 14/23

Token sale contribution: The uniqueness of a

Token sale is that it allows you to gather potential

users of your platform.

14.2. Rules for the Token sale

1. A total of 75,000,000 tokens will be created by the

WandX team. For the Token sale, 55,000,000 will

2. There will be a minimum gas limit of 300,000.

Users can participate using Metamask,

MyEtherWallet, Parity, or Mist wallets. For

participating in the Token sale, we will integrate

Civic and uPort as identity management.

3. We aim to raise 12500ETH (ether) over a period of

4 weeks. We will end the token sale either when

the 12500ETH is raised or when the 4 weeks is up,

whichever comes first.

4. Users can send ether to our contract address

which will be displayed 2 hours before the start of

the Token sale. Ether must be sent through

MyEtherWallet, Mist, Parity or Metamask. Do not

send Ether through exchanges such as Jaxx,

Kraken, or others as your Ether may be stolen.

5. The funds raised during the Token sale will be

used for hiring, operation costs, and for technology

development.

6. Start date - October 27th 2pm GMT; End date -

November 21st 7:30pm GMT.

[Figure 5. Description of how the ether received during

the Token sale will be used]

14.3. Pre-Token sale

14.3.1 Why launch a pre-Token sale?

Gauge market sentiment — We would like to gauge

market sentiment for a decentralized basket of

crypto assets trading application such as ours.

Marketing — In the six weeks till the end of our

Token sale, we want to step up our PR and

marketing campaign for our platform.

Fast track mainnet release — We would like to

release WandX onto the mainnet soon after our

token sale, hence we will use part of the funds to

stress test our basket trading application APIs.

14.3.2 Time:

Start date and time — October 9th 2pm GMT.

End date and time — October 12th 7:30pm GMT.

Update: Since the whitelisted users exceeded 500ETH

of contribution, a pre-sale was not done.

14.3.3 Tokens:

5.2% of the total supply of Wand will be available

for the Pre-Token sale.

Pre-Token sale + Token sale = 12500ETH.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 16/23

Pre-Token sale = 530ETH.

Total Supply = 75 million Wand.

Supply offered for the pre-Token sale + Token sale

= 55 million Wand.

Supply offered for the Token sale = 51500000.

Supply offered for the pre-Token sale = 3500000.

Tokens accepted for the pre-Token sale = ETH.

Minimum Ether required to participate in the Pre-

Token sale = 1ETH.

Remaining Supply after pre-Token sale + Token

sale = 20 million Wand.

This remaining 20 million Wand supply will be

reserved for advisers, founders, and offered as a

Seasonal Token Offering during the release of

WandX 2.0.

[Token sale process]

14.3.5 How to participate:

Send your Ether only through MyEtherWallet, Mist

Wallet, Parity Wallet, Metamask to the address

mentioned on the Token sale page at 2pm GMT on

October 8th for pre-sale and 2pm GMT on October 27th

for Token sale. Do not send Ether through exchanges

such as Poloniex or through wallets such as the Jaxx

wallet, since your ether could be misplaced.

Please read the terms and conditions before

participating in our pre-Token sale and our Token sale.

14.4 WandX protocol and the Wand token



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 17/23

The Wand tokens are utility Tokens in the WandX

application. They act as a loyalty points scheme in

retail. Users are incentivized to create and trade in

ERC20 Token baskets, hence every time a creation or

trade occurs, users get a small amount of Wand tokens

added to their address The Ethereum blockchain

protocol token (which is Ether) allows users to use

Ether in the Ethereum world computer; the

filecoin/storj/sia protocol token allows users to use

tokens for file storage; pending regulatory approval, the

WandX protocol would ensure clearing of ERC20 Token

baskets based contracts. These contracts could be a

number of Token products or baskets or variations on

these products or baskets that are used to cater to

users with different reward/risk appetites. Hence each

of the modules at WandX are in the form of an API,

both for security reasons as well as to enable users to

clear contracts on other platforms using our APIs. The

WandX protocol token is a means to an end - create

decentralized markets for any ERC20 Token

instrument/product.

15. System architecture

15.1 Core platform

Data storage: Data on all trades conducted will be

stored on the IPFS/Swarm. However, our pilot will

be designed to store data in our servers. This pilot

is to verify contract creation, trade and settlement.

The next pilot will verify data storage, retrieval and

pushing data back to the IPFS/Swarm.

Methods: Variations of baskets of ERC20 Tokens

will be available as well as the ability to record

current crypto-assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

Users can create, trade, and settle these products



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 18/23

using the front-end, which connects to our smart

contract architecture.

Permissions: Users can set permissions on the

contracts that they create. Permissions help build

an additional layer of trust in the system.

Contract creators: These are functionalities

provided to the users to create their products.

These directly link to smart contracts at the

backend, hence any product that the user creates

is in essence a smart contract on the Ethereum

blockchain.

Connecting to other platforms: We will eventually

provide APIs to retrieve data from our platform for

use in markets such as Gnosis. We would also

integrate crypto-assets recorded on other

blockchains through protocols such as the COMIT

protocol, but this would only happen after the

release of WandX 2.0 since we are experimenting

with the stability of such protocols for mainstream

use.

Off-chain capabilities: We are working on

technology to create most transactions off-chain

in order to prevent clogging of the Ethereum

network. In the real world trades happen in

microseconds, which we can enable either through

pegged blockchains, lightning networks, or state

channels through integration of socket.io and

Whisper.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 19/23

[Figure 6. Front end design of WandX]

15.2 WandX Beta (Olio basket trading application)

Our Beta product enables users to trade in a basket of

ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. There are three main

features of Olio - Create basket, buy a basket, sell a

basket. The basic principles in designing Olio is to

keep all transactions on-chain while all other

computations and non-token transfer transactions off-

chain.

15.2.1 WandX-Olio API

In order to realize the creation of the WandX protocol

for decentralized ERC20 Token instruments, starting

with the Olio basket trading application, WandX is

creating APIs for all future Dapps on WandX. Each API

will contain all functionality available on the Dapp, and

the API will act as a bridge between the front-end Dapp

and the Ethereum smart contracts. In addition to the

protocol, the API would add a security layer for the

platform as well as an additional business model for

external API calls.



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 20/23

[Figure 7. WandX-Olio architecture]

15.2.2 Create baskets

Users can create a basket of ERC20 tokens (known as

a basket from now on) which can then be traded with

other users. For our Beta product, we will enable

creation of baskets from the top 20 ERC20 tokens.

Users can select the percentages of each ERC20 token

in the basket. If the user has the coins in his wallet, the

basket is immediately created. If not, the user is

redirected to an exchange.

15.2.3 Buy baskets

Users can quote bid prices for basket that they want to

own. For the first two weeks, users can quote prices in

Ether, and then they can quote prices in only Wand

tokens. All bids have an expiry date and time; when

sellers accept a bid, the basket along with the

underlying coins is transferred to the buyer and the

seller receives Ether.

15.2.4 Sell baskets

Users who own a basket can quote an ask price when

they want to sell it. For the first two weeks they may

quote in Ether, following which period they would quote

in Wand. When a buyer accepts the ask price, the

basket is transferred and Ether/Wand is transferred to



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 21/23

the seller. If the seller wants to liquidate the basket and

get the underlying coins, he activates the liquidate

contract through the Dapp and the Wand-Olio API, after

which they receive the underlying coins in their

address.

15.2.5 On-chain

All transactions that happen on-chain are through

the WandX-Olio API. The API integrates the Dapp

with the smart contracts, hence improving security

of the platform and providing an additional

business model for future use of the APIs.

Creating baskets: Creation of baskets by users is

done through the WandX-Olio API.

Buy/sell baskets: Accepting Bid and Ask prices

calls functions from the API which execute the

smart contract code.

Liquidate baskets: Liquidation is the process of

getting the underlying coins into your address.

This event again calls the smart contract through

the Olio API.

Recording changes in the order book: Any change

in ownership of a basket is also recorded on the

WandX order book contract.

Use of WandX Token sale revenue: The revenue

gained from the WandX Token sale will be used as

mentioned on our token sale page. Addresses are

assigned for operational costs, hiring, and basket

creation. Users can see how the revenue is used

by seeing the consumption of tokens in each of

these addresses.

15.2.6 Off-chain

Order book listing: Listing the basket available to

buy/sell will be done off-chain. Keeping the list on-



3/24/2018 WandX whitepaper · GitBook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/wandxdapp/wandx-whitepaper/details 22/23

chain would be very expensive because of gas

costs due to change in contract state.

Bid/Ask quotes: Listing of bid/ask quotes is done

off-chain, with only the accepted quote being

moved to the blockchain through the API and

smart contract.

16. Risk and compliance

Token sale: The ETH address to which you will

have to send your ETH during the token sale will be

on the date of the Token sale.

Terms and conditions: Before participating in our

Dapp or token sale, users will have to accept the

terms and conditions and privacy policy of our

platform, login through civic, enter their Ethereum

address.

17. Advantages of WandX

Automated decentralized contracts: There’s no

middleman to guarantee the obligation of smart

contracts on WandX; this process is automated.

WandX provides an easy, automated, decentralised

method of creation and exchanging tokens. This

would help in providing more liquidity to the

contracts and the tradability of tokens.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain based products:

connect with the blockchain.
