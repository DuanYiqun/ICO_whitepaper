Scaling Bitcoin Economy

01 INTRODUCTION 
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies based on the Bitcoin protocol are here to stay. At its core, 
the Bitcoin protocol has the right formulae for it to become the leading universally ac-
cepted currency. Bitcoin already functions as a store of value and medium of exchange. 
But, in order for it to gain significance as a unit of account in global trade, it needs to 
scale both technically and economically.  

This paper does not cover Bitcoin’s technical scaling issues. Instead, this paper aims to 
deal with the economic scaling challenges that Bitcoin must overcome. Bitcoin has dis-
played impressive growth, starting as an obscure open source project in 2009, and achiev-
ing a multi-billion market capitalisation, it is now receiving mainstream financial media at-
tention. In order for Bitcoin to be even more widely adopted as a currency, and for the Bit-
coin economy to play a leading role as a medium of exchange in global financial markets, 
it needs to expand in scale by orders of magnitude. At the appropriate scale, Bitcoin could 
be used to settle global trade in raw materials, such as precious metals, base metals used 
in manufacturing and various industries, consumables, like coffee, wheat, corn and energy 
products, like oil. At this scale, Bitcoin could gain significance as a unit of account by way 
of settling global high volume trades for regional and international imports and exports for 
production and consumption goods, with cash settled and physically deliverable instru-
ments available for producers and speculators alike.  

The three functions of money are (1) store of value, (2) medium of exchange, and (3) unit 
of account and they operate in a hierarchy, especially when bootstrapping a new money 
such as Bitcoin. If any two people are prepared to treat the asset as a store of value in the 
course of a transaction, then it is possible for the asset to serve as a medium of ex-
change. This relationship is sequential. Similarly, when the asset is used substantially as a 
medium of exchange across society, then it may be considered a unit of account. Some 
economists consider unit of account to be the final and most important characteristic of 
money, because it means that goods and services are priced in the numéraire, or basic 
standard by which value is computed. Central banks’ control of the unit of account is typ-
ically argued to be a defining feature of monetary policy. Along the hierarchy from store of 
value to medium of exchange and finally to unit of account, Globitex targets the medium 
of exchange function, which will undoubtedly establish the foundation for Bitcoin as the 
world’s numéraire. [1] 

In order for the Bitcoin economy to achieve the necessary scale, it will require a substan-
tial increase of liquidity which will likely result in greater price stability. Increased liquidity 
and relative price stability are a necessary step in the development of Bitcoin and crypto-
currencies as a global medium of exchange. The formation of stable capital markets, 
along with their corresponding interest rates will establish a natural market-based refer-
ence rates and thus increase liquidity and price stability.

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

In order to facilitate the use of Bitcoin as an industrial scale medium of exchange, we pro-
pose taking the existing Globitex exchange infrastructure and scaling it up into an ex-
change that has global spot and derivatives exchange capabilities, where standardised 
instruments in money markets and major commodities are listed with cash settlement 
and later physical delivery, and where Bitcoin is used as the underlying currency - a unit of 
account. 

To realise this goal, Globitex is issuing the GBX utility Token. The Token will be issued as 
an EIP-20 (previously known as ERC-20) compliant Ethereum smart contract. [2] The GBX 
Token will primarily be used for the settlement of trades on the Globitex exchange, serving 
as a commission payment token. The GBX Token will also function within loyalty pro-
grams planned for Globitex clients and contributors, whereby the contributors will be par-
ticipating in   the company's overall success. The GBX Token can be acquired during the 
Globitex token sale (www.globitexico.com) using Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (XBT) and Bitcoin 
Cash (BCH). The project development will be conducted in stages, each representing the 
team’s commitment to specific business milestones as laid out in this White Paper.  

The full details on the GBX Token are included in the first chapter of this paper. 

In the following chapters of this White Paper, we examine the importance of money 
markets and commodity trading and why such assets should be linked to Bitcoin. We 
present the legal setup for achieving these goals, and enumerate the roadmap and the 
required stages of business development for this undertaking. We include a technical 
description of Globitex product, and the expected system development plan. In the an-
nex, we attach information on commodities markets and statistics that are relevant to 
the Bitcoin economy, which enforce the case for why Bitcoin is potentially the most ap-
propriate medium of exchange for global trade. Finally, we extrapolate an estimated path 
of success in terms of volumes traded for Globitex as a global spot and derivatives ex-
change in Bitcoin.

02 GBX TOKEN 
To realise the business goals set forth in this paper, an Ethereum EIP-20 (previously 
known as ERC-20) smart contract protocol based token (the GBX Token) – will be issued 
by Globitex Limited, private limited company (the Company) incorporated in Gibraltar 
fully owned by AS Globitex Holding (Latvia). The Company will use the proceeds from 
the token sale to obtain various rights to use, exploit and licence the existing Globitex IT 
infrastructure and trading platform. The Company will also use the token sale proceeds 
to further develop the eco-system, infrastructure and trading platform according to the 
aims described in this White Paper in order to develop the services that the Token can 
be exchanged for. 

Application 

The GBX token will serve the primary purpose of a means of settlement of trades on the 
Globitex exchange, serving as a commission payment token, as well as used within loyalty 
programs. Redeemed GBX Tokens are intended to be burned and therefore permanently 
removed from circulation. 

GBX Tokens will be usable to cover commission payments for the trades made on the 
Globitex platform. All registered clients of the Globitex exchange will be able to redeem 
GBX tokens as payment for commissions. Initially the tokens will be subject to a signific-
ant premium of no less than 20%. For example, at a price of GBX 1 = EUR 0.10, the client 
opting to use GBX as payment for trades will be able to enjoy the following bonus: GBX 1 = 
EUR 0.10 + 20%. Over time, depending on overall Company’s success, the bonus will 
largely increase in order to stimulate widespread utilisation of GBX tokens for trade set-
tlement.  

Furthermore,   Globitex will offer other Company success-related member loyalty pro-
grams to reward its clients and token holders during the GBX Token lifetime.  

Overall, GBX Token is expected to have a 10 year lifetime, during which time, tokens can 
be redeemed, loyalty programs and other success-related benefits enacted. After 10 years 
will have elapsed, the Company will review the GBX Token program and make the neces-
sary adjustments on continuation of the program.

Token Distribution and Lock up Periods 

65% of GBX token pool are sold to contributors, whereas 35% are allocated to the Com-
pany for future use, including: 5% for bounty and referral programs; 10% for business de-
velopment (e.g. team expansion, marketing, security rewards, conferences etc.); and two 
tranches of 10% released every consecutive year, following the end of the Token Sale for 
further business promotion.  

Token Sales 

The GBX Token will be sold during the token sale in exchange for Ether (ETH), Bitcoin 
(XBT) and Bitcoin cash (BCH). Token distribution will be done after the end of token sales. 

AML & Due Diligence 

The Globitex platform meets high standards of European anti-money laundering require-
ments in respect of client due diligence, suspicious transaction monitoring and reporting 
and the avoidance of crime and terrorist financing. Token holders will therefore be subject 
to Globitex exchange KYC to be able to redeem Tokens as commission payment. 

Privacy  

Contributors may be asked to provide certain personal information in order to participate 
in the Token Sale and some contributor personal data may need to be verified, according 
to Globitex Token Sale Terms and Privacy Policy.  

Future Provisions 

The Company may partner up with other regulated and unregulated entities in order to at-
tain the business goals described in this paper, such as provision of payment or invest-
ment services for example.

03 PROJECT BACKGROUND 
Globitex is an institutional grade Bitcoin exchange, with a fully functional FIX API con-
nectivity, offering direct market access for algorithmic traders. Launched in the summer 
of 2017 as a working prototype, it is being tested in a limited Beta mode and is expected 
to begin open public operations by the beginning of the year 2018.  

Having built the exchange to meet sophisticated institutional client needs, we now oper-
ate Globitex from the starting point of allowing the exchange of the Bitcoin and Euro trad-
ing pair on a secure and well-established platform. Building Globitex with a view to the fu-
ture, however, requires tackling one of the major issues that Bitcoin faces: liquidity, or the 
current lack thereof.  

Therefore, one of the first goals for Globitex is to launch other major currency pairs; to ex-
pand the Bitcoin-FX order books, thus covering instant trading, deposits, and withdrawals 
in major currencies around the globe. The next step is to develop cryptocurrency money 
markets, where eligible market participants are able to lend out their assets at specific 
maturities by setting market-based interest rates. The development of a money market in 
Bitcoin will be the major catalyst in increasing liquidity and equalising supply and demand 
for Bitcoin in the spot market, as well as for various time future time frames, potentially 
transforming it into the most liquid currency.  

As Bitcoin liquidity increases, and as large money orders can be easily accommodated, 
Globitex will then enable standardised listing of various commodities futures and options 
on an open order book basis. The derivative contracts will be physically deliverable and 
exchanged in Bitcoin as the underlying currency. For example, the counterparties in a de-
rivatives contract could exchange physical commodities (crude oil, jet fuel, gold, silver, 
copper, corn, etc.) for a fixed amount of bitcoins at the maturity of the contract, or opt out 
of the physical delivery and settle in bitcoin instead.  

Scaling Globitex into a global spot and derivatives trading venue will allow producers to 
purchase exchange listed products for Bitcoin. Trading firms and speculators will also be 
able to hedge their risks in Bitcoin with derivatives contracts. Thus, scaling the Globitex 
exchange will benefit Bitcoin and foster its development as a medium of exchange that is 
suitable for facilitating global trade, overcoming geographic, political or monetary restric-
tions.

04 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT STAGES 
In order to be able to achieve the goals set out in this White Paper, Globitex put forward 
a roadmap detailing the business development stages. Proposed Token Sale, which in-
cludes the issuance and distribution of the GBX Token, will fund the initial project devel-
opment. 

  

Stage I: Spot FX and REPO 

Scale spot FX, where Bitcoin can be traded vs. major fiat and other cryptocurren-
cies 

This will involve business development efforts for establishing additional banking rela-
tionships with bank partners around the globe and across the currency spectrum. This will 
also involve the undertaking of a thorough security and business evaluation, including de-
velopment of extensions for the payment system based on the highest security standards 
before adding other cryptocurrencies as trading instruments on Globitex. 

Implement FX margin trading ability - REPO 

By allowing Globitex clients to lend to each other with REPO, or standardised maturities 
repurchase agreement based instruments, Globitex clients will be able to use the bor-
rowed funds for leveraging their trading; the loans will be made available as collateralised 
debt instruments, which can also be used for purposes outside of the exchange. This, in 
turn, will create a money market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and thereby estab-
lish market based interest rates. Globitex will expand its core system level functionality to 
implement FX margin trading based on the peer-to-peer lending principle. Furthermore, to 
allow currency REPO instruments, a new risk module will also need to be implemented.  

List precious metals spot contracts 
Globitex will introduce commodities trading in bitcoin, starting with deliverable 
spot gold. Gold is an obvious choice to begin with, as Bitcoin itself is dubbed “digi-
tal gold”. Globitex will develop order book and distribution channels for gold 
bought on Globitex against bitcoin.

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

Stage II: BIBOR, Money Markets and Commodity Derivatives 

Develop Bitcoin money markets - BIBOR 

Aggregate the leading interest rate markets for Bitcoin margin lending, including the one 
developed by Globitex at stage I, in order to form a tradable interest rate product. Name it 
“BIBOR” (Bitcoin Inter-Broker Offered Rate) and offer BIBOR futures trading, thereby set-
ting the standard reference rate for the Bitcoin economy capital markets. Furthermore, 
expanding to  money markets in other cryptocurrencies based on market appetite.  

List cash settled commodity futures and options 
At this stage, business development and various partnerships will have positioned Globi-
tex to reference the existing USD based markets. By using traditional futures markets pri-
cing in commodities, we shall begin using Bitcoin at the scale needed for global trade by 
synthetically forming derivative instruments in commodities, paired with FX market de-
veloped in Stage I. These instruments will be listed in standardised maturities and settled 
in Bitcoin. We will begin by implementing precious metals cash settled futures trading and 
follow up with other commodities. By further developing IT infrastructure and risk man-
agement, the Globitex exchange will be able to accommodate options listings in commod-
ities, FX and money markets thereby linking Bitcoin to global trade at all levels of derivat-
ives. 

List cryptocurrency futures, swaps and options 

Create cryptocurrency-to-fiat and cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency based futures, swaps 
and options to be used as financial instruments for hedging, investing and speculating 
purposes.

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

Stage III: GCOM Commodity Index and Physical Commodities 

List Bitcoin priced Globitex commodity index - GCOM 

Aggregate various groups of commodities, listed in the previous stage, as cash settled 
futures, such as energy, grains, industrial metals, precious metals, softs, livestock, into a 
Bitcoin priced index. Such index would reflect Globitex and other exchange listed com-
modities value in Bitcoin. The index would have a specific weight for each commodity 
group. The index would first serve the purpose of a reference price, and may later form the 
bases for a tradable index futures product. Name the index Globitex Commodity index 
“GCOM” and prepare to offer GCOM futures trading. 

Enable precious metals futures contracts to be physically deliverable 

The previously established Bitcoin settled derivatives need to be made deliverable physic-
ally in kind. Futures will become available for physical delivery. Starting with a precious 
metals spot market and integrating in existing precious metals distribution channels, we 
shall allow a standard commodity kind to be delivered and deliverable in exchange as a 
collateral in some pre-agreed form. Globitex will work on specific form for certificates of 
ownership - warehouse receipts in the form of tokens, which may be tracked and verified 
on a public blockchain.  

Further develop warehousing infrastructure and expand spot commodities  

For commodities such as non-perishable energy products or industrial metals, which can 
be stored in warehouses for long time periods, we shall rely on the existing warehouse in-
frastructure, be it the established warehouses used by existing exchanges or other private 
warehouses complying with the common delivery standards, to allow other liquid derivat-
ive instruments to be physically deliverable. Similarly for consumables, we shall partner 
with existing wholesalers offering FOB (free on board) or CIF (cost insurance freight) 
commodities for purchase with Bitcoin and delivery in kind at designated ports and ware-
houses.

05 MONEY MARKETS & CURRENCIES 
The need for global benchmark rates for cryptocurrencies 

One of the cornerstones of a market-based economy is the  establishment a mature bor-
rowing and lending market. Bitcoin’s transition from a tradable novelty token, to a parallel 
economy where global trade takes place, requires a functioning interest rate market for 
the currency. Prudent borrowing and lending powers an economy and establishes the 
infrastructure for proper allocation of capital. This chapter will examine the basics of 
money markets, and why these are relevant for Bitcoin’s liquidity and how Globitex will 
position itself to capture this market. 

The Yield Curve 

In traditional finance, a yield curve is a line that plots the interest rates of fixed-income se-
curities that display an equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The typical yield 
curve is formed from the three-month, two-year, five-year, ten-year and 30-year govern-
ment debt. This type of yield curve is used to benchmark against other debt in the market, 
such as bank lending rates, consumer loans, business loans, and mortgage rates. The 
shape of the yield curve can be useful for determining expected inflation rates as well as 
future economic conditions.

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

Components of the Interest Rate Curve 

With the young Bitcoin economy, maturities are much shorter and the data is intermittent 
and often less reliable. Therefore, as a starting point, the development of a true Bitcoin 
economy requires the formation of capital markets with corresponding interest rate dura-
tion curves across 1-day, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 1-year borrowing rates. Globitex will 
make a market in fiat-to-cryptocurrency swaps for the purposes of margin trading as well 
as creating a real repurchase agreement (REPO) market with ability to borrow crypto or 
fiat currency using other crypto or fiat currency as a collateral for the loan. Similar to other 
exchanges, these will start out as overnight borrowing rates for purposes of leveraged 
margin trading where the exchange matches the interest rate swaps for both sides of the 
trade. As the market matures, longer durations can be added or imputed. 

Importance of LIBOR 

LIBOR is referenced as the most globally significant benchmark rate in finance. LIBOR 
stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate. It is a set of daily average rates at which 
banks offer to borrow money from one another. Global financial institutions utilise these 
benchmark rates as a base for interest rate calculations throughout their portfolios. 

LIBOR offers daily average interest rates for five currencies (the U.S. dollar, euro, British 
pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc) and seven lending periods (ranging from 
overnight to 12 months). In total, there are 35 different daily LIBOR rates. LIBOR is gov-
erned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Benchmark Administration. The Adminis-
tration calculates the LIBOR rates every day by surveying participating banks. 

There are currently outstanding contracts worth trillions of dollars spread across differ-
ent maturities from overnight to 30 years that all reference the benchmark LIBOR. Ac-
cording to the UK Treasury, the value of financial contracts tied to LIBOR touches $300 
trillion. However, this does not include consumer loans or adjustable rate home mort-
gages. According to the ICE Benchmark Administration, “In total, hundreds of trillions of 
dollars’ worth of interest rate exposure is tied to ICE LIBOR.” [3] 

Bitcoin Borrowing Reference Rate (BIBOR) 

Globitex will aggregate the leading interest rate markets across the Bitcoin ecosystem to 
form a consolidated and published reference interest rate. Short-term and long-term rate 
sources will be taken from a variety of applications, such as margin trading rates, P2P 
lending rates, and fixed deposit facilities. The initial quotations will be in Bitcoin (XBT) for 
1-day and 7-day durations, expanding into 14-day and 30-day durations going forward.  

www.globitexico.com � Page �  of �14 46

http://www.globitexico.com


Scaling Bitcoin Economy

The aggregated reference rate will be referred to as BIBOR (Bitcoin Inter-Broker Offered 
Rate), a term first coined by Jon Matonis. [4] 

Token/Cryptocurrency Index Futures 

Likewise, as the overall market for tokens and cryptocurrencies develops and becomes 
more sophisticated, Globitex will be in a position to standardise a relevant selection of 
tokens and cryptocurrencies into indices. Such indices will function much like traditional 
equity indices, for which there will also be a standardised futures market, provided by 
Globitex. 

Source: FIA, 2016 VOLUME SURVEY 

In traditional futures and options exchanges, equity indices make up the bulk of exchange 
trading volumes, followed by individual equity and commodities markets, see the table 
and chart representation of contracts traded on global spot and derivatives exchanges 
around the globe. [5] 

It is therefore essential for Bitcoin to acquire a standardised exchange platform, where the 
listing of highly demanded investment products can be accessed by the global investing 
community.

06 COMMODITIES FOR BITCOIN 
The need for Bitcoin linked commodity spot and derivatives marketplace 

Despite the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem in recent years, there are no commodity fu-
tures, swaps or options listed in Bitcoin, whereas these markets offer an unrivalled op-
portunity for price discovery as much for the commodity in question as well as for the 
underlying currency used in the trade. Today, the most used and therefore relevant cur-
rency in global trade reveals to be the US Dollar due to several factors discussed in this 
chapter.  

Demand 

If one were to effectively purchase a shipload of coffee in Bitcoin, one would need first 
convert one’s Bitcoin to US Dollars, and then enter a forward or futures trade with physical 
settlement. This transaction would favour the USD fiat currency by demand directed to-
wards conversion and then settlement for the trade and delivery. If however, commodities 
had a direct pricing mechanism for Bitcoin on an organised exchange, it would diminish 
demand for fiat currency and therefore increase demand and subsequently liquidity for 
Bitcoin as a currency and unit of account.  

By allowing Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange on Globitex for global trade scale 
consumption and production of goods, such as commodities, it will strengthen Bitcoin’s 
relevance as a currency or unit of account globally.  

Imports and Exports 

One of the most important factors that determines the relevance of any currency is how it 
is represented in global trade, where nations and large institutions exchange production 
and consumption goods: both physical and intangible goods and services. Global trade is 
the ultimate exchange arena for a currency to gain relevance, because the currency that is 
in most demand for such trades will establish the liquidity to be considered a medium of 
exchange.  

By virtue of sheer demand for the exchange of goods, currencies, and services, global 
trade feeds the most liquid market on the planet - the foreign exchange market, estimated 
to have daily trading volumes of USD 5.067 trillion per day in 2016. [6] 

Being used as a medium of exchange for global trade is the ultimate destination in terms 
of relevancy for a currency. All humans benefit from trade and our modern material reality

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

is made up of global trade, so much so that we are now completely dependant on it. In 
2016, the annual value of all imports and exports is estimated at USD 15.83 trillion glob-
ally. [7]  

US Dollar Dominance 

According to the Bank for International Settlements 2017 data, we can observe a clear 
dominance by a few currencies in global trade. Indeed, trades are largely denominated in 
US Dollars. These findings are based on data, which exclude Euro payments used inside 
of Europe amongst the member states, and which is best described by data provided by 
SWIFT  organisation. [8] The data is based on international trade and shows that very few 1
countries are able to invoice their trades in their own national currency.  

These facts point to a world where a disproportionate share of trade is invoiced in 
very few currencies, and the dollar has an outsized role. [9] 

These conclusions were originally evidenced by a professor at the economics department 
of Harvard University Gita Gopinath in her research paper [10], where she concludes that 
the reason why import and export trades are invoiced in US dollar is largely due to price 
stability as an endogenous choice. There are no clearly distinguishable political pressures 
or other factors influencing the choice of invoicing currency but for the price stability 
factor alone.

where EUR comes second with 5.9% share followed by the British Pound and Japanese Yen.

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

Bitcoin, as it is used today, is not a stable currency in terms of valuation in other curren-
cies, it is also not used in international trade, because it is not present on global spot and 
derivatives exchanges. Indeed, we cannot speak of a Bitcoin economy per se, as Bitcoin’s 
acceptance and its use cases are few and far in between.  

However, Bitcoin's digital nature and its underlying protocol spell a potential for use on a 
global scale, as is the potential for gaining both the liquidity and the relevance needed for 
use as a global currency.  

The importance of any currency is defined by its use cases, such as being used for global 
trade, which largely marks any currency relevance and liquidity. Bitcoin potentially stands 
as the most suitable currency for use in global trade - cheap, quick, irreversible and bound 
by sound monetary policy at its protocol core.

07 LEGAL SETUP 
This chapter evaluates the legal regulation and necessary licenses in order to implement 
the objectives of this white paper. The Globitex team will start operations from Europe 
and accept clients globally. Further development stages will involve representation out-
side Europe and investigation of country-specific regulations and licensing for physical 
presence. After having assessed regulatory environments in different regions and juris-
dictions, the Globitex team has decided to base the project in the European Union. 
Therefore, the following section of this white paper will provide a short analysis of the 
legal framework in EU for Bitcoin, and for Bitcoin derivatives trading.  

Cryptocurrency Spot Trading  

The financial sector in the EU is regulated on two main levels – by EU legislative acts 
(regulations and directives), as well as the national laws of each member state. National 
legislation is mostly harmonised among member states by implementing EU directives. 
However, where there is a need for very limited discretion in national implementation regu-
lations are introduced that have direct effect across the EU without the requirement for 
national transposition to achieve the aims of the European law. At the highest level Eu-
ropean law is ultimately governed by principles of law contained in the relevant EU Treat-
ies (and that deal with foundational matters such as four basic freedoms of the EU single 
market: free movement of goods, capital, services and workers). 

Most of the member states and their financial regulators have taken the position that Bit-
coin and other cryptocurrencies are not regulated payment services or financial instru-
ments, and therefore it follows that exchange service businesses are excluded from regu-
latory and supervisory scope. For a very limited scope i.e. prevention of money-laundering 
and terrorism financing, European Parliament is currently reviewing amendments to 4th 
AML directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 
2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laun-
dering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Par-
liament and of the Council, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parlia-
ment and of the Council and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC) which would add virtual 
currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers to the list of obliged entities 
within the scope of the directive. In addition, we are beginning to see a demand for a high-
er level of regulatory oversight (and support) for the crypto-economy. For example, Gibral-
tar is currently consulting on a new regime to provide a regulatory framework for financial 
services authorisation of such crypto-exchanges and custodians. [11]

Based on the prevailing legal and regulatory environment, Globitex will seek to provide the 
best regulatory protection to its customers in cryptocurrency activities, and will seek to 
obtain the necessary permissions or agency relationships in order to facilitate fiat cur-
rency transactions.  

Derivatives Denominated in Cryptocurrencies  

As noted in this white paper, Globitex intends to create a trading infrastructure for cash 
settled and physically delivered cryptocurrency futures, options, and swaps. Such instru-
ments, contrary to the unclear legal status of cryptocurrencies themselves, fall under the 
existing EU legal framework. According to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parlia-
ment, and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amend-
ing Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (MIFID II) Annex I Section C, financial 
instruments are: 

(4) Options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and any other derivative con-
tracts relating to securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, emission allowances 
or other derivatives instruments, financial indices or financial measures which may 
be settled physically or in cash; 

(5) Options, futures, swaps, forwards and any other derivative contracts relating to 
commodities that must be settled in cash or may be settled in cash at the option of 
one of the parties other than by reason of default or other termination event; 

(6) Options, futures, swaps, and any other derivative contract relating to commodit-
ies that can be physically settled provided that they are traded on a regulated mar-
ket, a MTF (multilateral trading facility), or an OTF (organised trading facility), except 
for wholesale energy products traded on an OTF that must be physically settled; 

(7) Options, futures, swaps, forwards and any other derivative contracts relating to 
commodities, that can be physically settled not otherwise mentioned in point 6 of 
this Section and not being for commercial purposes, which have the characteristics 
of other derivative financial instruments; 

(8) Derivative instruments for the transfer of credit risk; 

(9) Financial contracts for differences. 

Based on this definition, the derivative instruments Globitex is planning to trade on its plat-
form are financial instruments as defined by EU legislation and as implemented in nation-
al laws.

Licensing Requirements for Derivatives Trading 

The MIFID II directive states that all multilateral trading systems in financial instruments 
shall operate either in accordance with the provisions concerning multilateral trading facil-
ities (MTFs) or organised trading facilities (OTFs) or the provisions concerning regulated 
markets. MTF in the directive is defined as a multilateral system, operated by an invest-
ment firm or a market operator, which brings together multiple third-party buying and 
selling interests in financial instruments – in the system and in accordance with non-dis-
cretionary rules while OTF is defined as multilateral system which is not a regulated mar-
ket or an MTF and in which multiple third-party buying and selling interests in bonds, 
structured finance products, emission allowances or derivatives are able to interact in the 
system.  

The term 'non-discretionary rules' means that the investment firm operating an MTF has 
no discretion as to how interests may interact. Interests are brought together by forming a 
contract and the execution takes place under the system's rules or by means of the sys-
tem's protocols or internal operating procedures. The MTF can be operated by a market 
operator or an investment firm whereas the operation of a regulated market is not con-
sidered an investment service and is carried out exclusively by market operators that are 
authorised to do so. 

After conducting a review and comparative analysis of the pros and cons of the three po-
tential licenses – regulated market, MTF and OTF – the Globitex team has assessed that 
the OTF license is the most appropriate legal framework for the Globitex derivatives trad-
ing platform. While trading on regulated markets and MTFs is mostly done through regu-
lated broker members (as intermediaries between the trading venue and retail client) one 
of the key benefits of the OTFs is that they can deal with the end clients directly.  

Client protection  

According to the MIFID II, OTFs must put in place arrangements, policies, procedures and/
or rules governing the following: 

• access to the OTF, with a focus on suitability/appropriateness for a prospective client; 
• which instruments can be traded on the OTF; 
• fair and orderly trading, with objective criteria for efficient execution; 
• the efficient settlement of transactions; 
• sound management of technical operations associated with the OTF, including contingency planning; 
• the monitoring of transactions for rule breaches, disorderly conditions and suspicious activities (par-

ticularly in relation to market abuse); 
• setting and monitoring position limits in certain commodities; 
• the retention of relevant records;  
• appropriate management oversight of the above.

Transparency Requirements  

Pre-trade and post-trade transparency both apply to any order or transaction executed 
through the system or under the rules of an OTF. According to the directive, OTF operators 
have to publish the details of current bids and offers and the depth of trading interests of 
those prices. To comply with post-trade transparency rules, OTF operators have to make 
public the details of transactions as close to real time as is technically possible.  

Passporting Rights in the EU 

According to MIFID II, Member States shall ensure that any investment firm authorised 
and supervised by the competent authorities of another Member may freely provide in-
vestment services (which includes operating OTF) within their territories, provided that 
such services and activities are covered by its authorisation. Thus, OTF licensed in one 
member state can operate freely across all EU countries.

08 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION 
Presently launched in a limited Beta test phase, Globitex is operational, thoroughly 
tested and validated by our Beta Testers and Globitex software development team, and 
is planned for an open public launch by beginning of the year 2018. As the Token Sale 
project outlines substantial business commitments, the team will develop the required 
enhancements, with a view of adding them to the current trading platform, in order to 
adapt the system for the new products and services laid out in this paper. 

Working Prototype 

Currently, the Globitex platform is implemented as an advanced, high-performance Bitcoin 
spot trading venue utilising industry best-practices with various well-designed API types, 
customisable web interface, sophisticated reporting tools – overall intended for use by 
professional traders as well as retail clients. High-security standards are used across the 
system. The technological base for the exchange system can be divided into 3 layers:  

•  Frontline modules layer, including networking and connectivity interfaces, 
•  Core system layer, 
•  Backend management system and support channels layer.

The Exchange Interfaces 

Frontline modules are used by customers and partners for communication. These mod-
ules exhibit all the functionality provided by the system Core. They support protocols and 
industry standards that are widely used in the largest trading venues across the world. 
Each of these modules supports horizontal scaling to accommodate for growing system 
loads on the Globitex exchange. 

The standard protocol used by a wide range of well-established exchanges, banks, and 
brokerage systems, to accept and process the bulk of client order flows is the FIX protocol 
(Financial Information eXchange). The FIX protocol is the preferred trading interface for 
automated trading systems and algorithmic traders. It is supported by the Globitex ex-
change and can be used by clients and match the highest performance, latency, and 
throughput expectations. It also allows integration of existing trading applications that

support the FIX protocol as an out-of-the-box solution with minimal customisation re-
quired. 

In addition to the FIX protocol, the Globitex exchange supports the REST API (REpresenta-
tional State Transfer Application Programming Interface) and the WebSocket API. These 
protocols display the same functionality as FIX and add even more options that are relev-
ant to payment services and accounts management systems and offer easier develop-
ment similar to existing cryptocurrency exchange APIs. The REST and WebSocket APIs 
are typically used by the large community of web developers and individual algorithmic 
traders who prefer simplicity over low-latencies, who integrate exchange services in their 
applications and web pages. 

For retail clients, the main interface to access the exchange services is the point-and-click 
trading platform. The Globitex exchange provides a web trading platform for hand-traders. 
It features a modular design where each of the modules can be customised and relocated 
to match each user's individual needs, trading skills and preferences. 

The Core System 

The Core System consists of a set of services that ensure the operation of the exchange. 
The central components of the Core System are the Risk Management System, the Order 
Matching Engine, the Clearing and Settlement System, and the Data Feed Services. To 
handle high system loads and ensure fault tolerance, the Core System is designed to be 
modular, redundant, and CPU cycle and cache efficient. The system relies on advanced 
queuing and messaging techniques to achieve the highest throughputs with the lowest

latency requirements. Ultra-low-latency communication protocols are used to connect the 
trading interfaces with the core modules. 

The Payments component is the most security sensitive part of the exchange platform. It 
consists of the Fiat Payment Processing Module, a Cryptocurrency Payment Processing 
Subsystem, an Accounting Module and Payment Workflow Engine. It is tightly linked with 
the other Core system modules, like the Risk Management System for balance checking, 
the Clearing and Settlement system for trade booking and AML (Anti Money Laundering) 
system for transaction checking. The Fiat and cryptocurrency payment processing sys-
tem consists of micro services providing the interfaces to be integrated with several third-
party payment systems and cryptocurrency networks. 

New developments 

In order to support new commodities and money market products and services, and to 
enhance user experience, the following modules are to be added to the system: 

• Cryptocurrency REPO (Repurchase Agreement) system 
• Futures instrument trading module 
• Options instrument trading module 
• Swap instrument trading module 
• Risk control module for leveraged position margin control 
• Clearing and settlement system for futures, options, swaps and physically settled instruments  
• Cross-linkable instrument liquidity derivation services 
• Iceberg and hidden orders 
• Dark pool trading services 
• Responsive web platform for mobile devices 
• FAST protocol (FIX Adapted for STreaming) for low latency price streaming 
• Integration with SEPA euro payment system  

The Globitex platform will organise a REPO as a peer-to-peer lending facility. The system 
will support options to create collateral-secured loans for clients. A real-time risk-control 
module will allow clients to withdraw a part of the borrowed funds that does not exceed 
the specified haircut. 

Introduction of the Futures, Swaps and Options trading modules requires an implementa-
tion of specific processing logic in the Risk Control Module and the Clearing and Settle-
ment system, which involves: 

• position opening and closing for the contract,  
• initial and maintenance margin calculation,  
• a mechanism for margin call processing and position liquidation in case of breach of margin require-

ments.  

A specific execution process for Options instruments will also be implemented. 

www.globitexico.com � Page �  of �26 46

http://www.globitexico.com


Scaling Bitcoin Economy

For some of the cash settled futures instruments, settlement price is calculated based on 
the price indices and the settlement process can be automated. Whereas physically deliv-
erable products have different processing requirements in the system that involve stock 
inventory holding commission processing in client accounts, stock inventory manage-
ment, processing of inventory replenishment and redemption. 

To support large-volume traders in parallel with a public order-book market, the system 
will allow for the introduction of dark pool trading services. Globitex is planning to create 
different options for order matching in dark pools, for example, by allowing order match-
ing events to occur at specified time intervals, this way achieving better protection for 
market participants from undesirable order price discovery and price movement fluctu-
ations. Furthermore, iceberg orders will be added to support tools that allow for adding 
larger liquidity in the public orderbook. 

Another important feature supported by Core Services is ‘liquidity derivation services’ 
based on the cross-linkable order-books. As the Globitex exchange is supposed to sup-
port multiple cryptocurrency-to-fiat instrument pairs, this will allow for synthetically popu-
lating order-books with sparse liquidity by reallocating liquidity from other linkable trading 
pairs. 

By adapting the web platform for mobile devices, Globitex will bring exchange services to 
the fingertips of the users “on the road”. This will expand serviceable reach and will allow 
for targeting of wider client base. 

Globitex will also be adding the FAST protocol (FIX Adapted for STreaming) in addition to 
the already supported FIX protocol. The FAST protocol is designed as a data compression 
protocol and used to transport a high volume of market data to meet the needs for ultra-

low-latency applications. Appreciated by High-Frequency traders, the inclusion of the 
FAST protocol can define a new client base for cryptocurrency exchanges. 

Globitex will continuously develop and maintain the system in order to be able to add new 
protocols and interfaces to the exchange’s Core system so as to support new client de-
mands and application types in the future.

09 GLOBITEX TEAM 
Globitex was founded by a team of traders to bring their expertise and vision to the Bit-
coin industry. The founding team has previously worked together for many years in asset 
management, primarily trading spot commodities and derivatives on global futures and 
derivatives exchanges, including jurisdictions such as China, Japan, USA and Europe. 
Globitex Chairman Jon Matonis joined the team in 2015, bringing to the table his extens-
ive track record as an executive of technology companies, Bitcoin visionary as well as 
his own trading experience in commodities markets.  

In the wake of the demise of the notorious Mt. Gox [12], the Globitex team found validation 
on their belief that a more robust system was required in order for Bitcoin to gain world-
wide acceptance. Already previously close as colleagues, and having backgrounds in as-
set management businesses, they all shared an enthusiasm for the nascent cryptocur-
rency - Bitcoin. Indeed, the failure of the largest Bitcoin exchange, and its impact on the 
Bitcoin ecosystem at that time served as the major impetus for the Globitex team to pin-
point the direction in which to move forward with fostering the growth of Bitcoin.  

Building on our significant experience in derivatives instruments and markets, especially 
commodities spot and futures trading, we decided to build our own exchange and thus 
better the industry overall. Based on our trading expertise and thinking from the perspect-
ive of the traders that would be using our platform, we wanted to bring our experience to 
Bitcoin by building an exchange that reflects our vision of how an exchange should work 
in terms of connectivity, matching, settlement, reporting, and business integrity.

10 CONCLUSION  
In this White Paper we have laid out a plan for how Globitex, by means of issuing the 
GBX Token intends to tackle Bitcoin's economy scaling issues. We have, along the way, 
examined the importance of money markets and commodity trading, and why such as-
sets should be linked to Bitcoin. We have presented the legal setup for achieving the 
goals of the project, and enumerated the roadmap for stages of business development. 
The technical description of Globitex product demonstrates the soundness of Globitex 
as a technically robust system, capable of scaling to the necessary industrial trading 
level, with a capacity to accommodate standardised money markets and commodities 
listings. 

We have presented our Readers with, the idea of linking Bitcoin and thus digital currencies 
to a significant use case – global trade in spot and advanced derivatives for money mar-
kets and commodities. In other words, we have sketched out a natural path of develop-
ment for an independent, decentralised, digital asset to effectively become relevant on a 
global scale as a medium of exchange and a stable unit of account.  

Globitex can be instrumental in the fulfilment of this vision with the currently available 
toolset: technically robust system in place, solid team members, driven by ideals and un-
hindered by political or legal influences.  

As traders ourselves, we understand what is at stake and are prepared to weather the 
storms that will inevitably present themselves on the way of achieving the goals set out in 
this White Paper.  

Indeed, we ask you, the Reader, and our esteemed Contributor, to help us achieve this 
goal, and participate in subsequent success.

11 ANNEX  
COMMODITIES 

Commodities trading plays an essential role in the global economy. Commodities mar-
kets are a venue, where producers, intermediaries and end-users come together to set or 
discover prices for basic raw materials used in production and consumption of goods at 
the wholesale and retail levels. Although some of production and consumption goods 
can be traded for bitcoin, there is no commodities trading venue where  basic raw mater-
ial commodity contracts are priced, margined and settled with Bitcoin.  

To enable global trade in Bitcoin, there needs to be a standardised offering of commodity 
derivatives on exchanges linked to Bitcoin as a currency. For global trade to begin taking 
shape in Bitcoin, exchange traded commodity contracts must also become available for 
physical delivery. For example, a farmer in Kenya could sell their coffee crop to a European 
coffee wholesaler through the bitcoin ecosystem. Buying and selling real-world goods and 
commodities is of the essence for a currency to become truly demanded and relevant in 
our everyday lives. This chapter will provide information on what commodities markets 
are and how they function in global trade. 

Types of Commodities 

Commodity markets trade in primary goods that are used as the ‘raw materials’ in manu-
factured products. Commodities have three main features, they are: 

 1. usually produced by many different producers; 
 2. uniform in quality between producers;  
 3. traded at a price resulting from the balance demand and supply.  

Commodities can be perishable or non-perishable. Non-perishable commodities such as 
metals are called ‘hard’ commodities. Perishable commodities such as agricultural com-
modities are called ‘soft’ commodities. Hard commodities are typically natural resources 
that must be mined or extracted (gold, rubber, oil, etc.), whereas soft commodities are ag-
ricultural products or livestock (corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, soybeans, pork, etc.) 

The World Bank’s global commodity price index accounts for 40 main commodities, 
which can be further divided into regional or qualitative varieties (e.g. different types 
of oil like WTI and Brent). [19]

Commodities Trading Organisation 

The majority of commodities are traded on the Over-the-Counter (OTC) market, however, a 
substantial percentage of commodity trading flows through the global commodities ex-
changes. These exchanges are important as their pricing information is crucial for price 
discovery and is therefore used as a reference pricing benchmark in the OTC market. The 
purpose of a commodity exchange is to provide an organised marketplace in which 
members can freely buy and sell various commodities in which they have an interest. 

The trading of commodities in commodity markets consists of direct physical trading 
(spot trading) and derivatives trading (forwards, futures, swaps and options). A market in 
which goods are sold for cash and delivered immediately is called the physical market. In 
the physical markets, participation is restricted to parties who are directly involved with 
that commodity, e.g., producers, farmers, refineries, wholesalers, marketers, physical 
traders, etc. 

The spot price of a commodity is the price that is quoted in the physical market for im-
mediate or spot settlement (payment and delivery). Spot settlement typically occurs one 
or two business days from trade date. This contrasts with the forward price established in 
a forward contract or futures contract, where contract terms (price) are set ‘now’, but de-
livery and payment will occur at a ‘future date’. 

The spot market is different from the futures market in that the value in the futures market 
is affected by the price of storage and future price movements. In the spot market, prices 
are affected by the existing supply and demand, which tends to make the prices more 
volatile. Another aspect that affects spot market prices is whether the commodity is per-
ishable or non-perishable. 

Contracts traded on the commodity exchanges are no longer limited to traditional com-
modities, and standardised contracts are introduced on a wide range of products and in-
dices like electricity, freight rates, and carbon emissions, besides the conventional base 
metals, soft commodities, oil, gas etc. The concept of “commodity” has been stretched 
beyond the traditional tangible physical products to contracts that are based on an in-
creasing range of physical commodities, market instruments and indices (whether settled 
by physical delivery or in cash). 

A forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specified date for a spe-
cified price. Other contract details like delivery date, price and quantity are negotiated bi-
laterally by the parties to the contract. The forward contracts for physical delivery are 
normally traded outside the exchanges. Forward markets for most commodities are afflic-
ted by several problems, such as lack of centralisation of trading, illiquidity, and counter-
party risk. 

Futures 

Futures markets were designed to solve the problems that exist in bilateral forward mar-
kets. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a 

www.globitexico.com � Page �  of �36 46

certain time in the future at a certain price. But unlike forward contracts, the futures con-
tracts are standardised and exchange traded. To facilitate liquidity in the futures contracts, 
the exchange specifies certain standard features of the contract. It is a standardised con-
tract with a standard underlying instrument, a standard quantity and quality of the underly-
ing instrument that can be delivered, (or which can be used for reference purposes in set-
tlement) and a standard timing of such settlement. A futures contract may be offset prior 
to maturity by entering into an equal and opposite transaction. The main standardised 
items in a futures contract are: quantity of the underlying asset; quality of the underlying 
asset; the date and the month of delivery; units of price quotation and minimum price 
change and place of delivery. 

The primary distinction between a futures market and a market in which actual commod-
ities are bought and sold, either for immediate or later delivery, is that in the futures mar-
ket one deals in standardised contractual agreements only. These agreements (more 
formally called futures contracts) provide for delivery of a specified amount of a particular 
commodity during a specified future month but involve no immediate transfer of owner-
ship of the commodity. 

Commodity exchanges provide platforms to suit the varied needs of their users. First, by 
bringing multiple buyers and sellers in a common platform, they provide a key role in the 
commodity price discovery process. Second, exchanges enable actual users to hedge 
their price risk independently from their bilateral physical purchase and sale contracts; 
hedging is the most common method of price risk management. Third, commodity ex-
changes provide liquidity by involving the physical buyers, sellers as well as investors and 
speculators. Lastly, they allows arbitrageurs trading on different platforms to generate op-
posing demand and supply forces which ultimately narrows down any price inefficiencies 
amongst traded contracts. Broadly main participants in commodity market can be classi-
fied as hedgers, arbitrageurs and speculators. In other words, manufacturers, traders, 
farmers, exporters and investors are all participating in this market. 

Most of the Commodity exchanges, which exist today, have their origin in the late 19th 
and earlier 20th century. The first central exchange was established in 1848 in Chicago 
under the name Chicago Board of Trade. The emergence of the derivatives markets as the 
effective risk management tools in 1970s and 1980s has resulted in the rapid creation of 
new Commodity Exchanges and expansion of the existing ones. Some of the world’s 
largest commodities exchanges currently are: Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), New 
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX, now part of CME Group), London Metal Exchange 
(LME) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). 

Options 

Options are fundamentally different from forward and futures contracts. An option gives 
the holder of the option, the right to buy or sell a contract at an agreed price known as the 
strike price. In contrast to forward or futures contract, where the two parties have a firm 
commitment to exchange the commodity (or the associated cashflows according to a 

www.globitexico.com � Page �  of �37 46

http://www.globitexico.com

formula in financially settled contracts), the option holder can decide not to exercise this 
right. Commodity options are option contracts with a commodity as the underlying. For 
instance, a gold options contract would give the holder the right to buy or sell a specified 
quantity of gold at the agreed strike price. 

There are two basic types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the 
right but not the obligation to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put op-
tion gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell an asset by a certain date for a 
certain price. 

In terms of the flexibility in the timing of the exercise, there are two main types of options. 
American options are options that can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. 
European options are options that can be exercised only on the expiration date itself.  

Clearing and Settlement 

Even though most futures contracts allow for physical delivery of the underlying commod-
ity at maturity, most futures market participants do not use the futures markets to cover 
their physical needs. Usually, only a small percentage of the total futures contracts that 
are entered into are ever settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity. Most 
futures market participants close their open positions before the expiration of the contract 
and settle their obligations with the exchange by receiving or paying a given amount of 
currency depending on the profit and loss from the trade. The margining and settlement 
functions in the exchange are taken care of by an entity called clearing house. 

Futures contracts that are physically delivered require the holders to either make  or take 
delivery to third-parties assigned by the exchange. Futures contracts that are cash settled 
are not deliverable and a simple debit or credit is issued when the contract expires. 

Clearing of trades that take place on an exchange happens through the exchange clearing 
house. A clearing house is a system by which exchanges guarantee the faithful compli-
ance of all trade commitments undertaken on the exchange trading systems. The main 
task of the clearing house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a 
day so that the net position of each of its members can be calculated. The clearing house 
also guarantees the performance to the parties to each transaction. 

Because all members are required to clear their trades through the clearing house and 
must maintain sufficient funds with it to cover their debit balances, the clearing house is 
placed in a position of being responsible to all members for the fulfilment of contracts. 
The clearing house becomes the “other party” for all futures trades between exchange 
members. 

Physical settlement of commodities involves accredited warehouses, which can be as-
sisted by registrar and transfer agents and assayers. Commodity exchange specifies ac-
credited warehouses through which delivery of a specific commodity can be effected and 
which will facilitate for storage of commodities. In exchange for the services provided,

warehouses charge a fee that constitutes storage and other charges such as insurance, 
assaying and handling charges or any other incidental charges. 

The Exchange may specify approved registrar and transfer agents through whom com-
modities can be dematerialised and who facilitate for dematerialisation/rematerialisation 
of commodities in the manner prescribed by the exchange. Exchange specified assayers 
ensure quality and grading of commodities (received at approved warehouses for delivery 
against deals made on the exchange).

BITCOIN ECONOMY 

The Bitcoin economy is still on the runway. This section examines Bitcoin in terms of 
usage and the potential for it to become a universally accepted currency; the statistical 
data on payments, and arguments on the nature of payments that constitute the relev-
ancy of any currency.  

Usage 

Perpetual human action is the very foundation of any economy. Humans are economic 
agents in constant pursuit of their individual goals. If individual agents are free, their busi-
ness interactions result in the exchange of consumption and production of goods and 
services. The medium of exchange that facilitates these transactions between various 
agents swapping goods and services is money - the most liquid of all assets - which cre-
ates a market equilibrium between production and consumption.  Now, what it is, exactly, 
that constitutes a medium of exchange – money – cannot be ascertained by anything 
other than its usage. The more widely an asset is used, the more likely it is to become a 
universally accepted medium of exchange. As stated by Ludvig von Mises:  

Business usage alone can transform a commodity into a common medium of ex-
change. It is not the state, but the common practice of all those who have dealings in 
the market, that creates money. [13] 

To date, Bitcoin is increasingly being used for retail. A comprehensive collection of 
vendors and merchants that accept Bitcoin as a payment is maintained by coinmap.org. 
There are close to 100 thousand venues that accept Bitcoin as a payment for goods and 
services, with new venues being added daily. 

Equally telling is the number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, now nearing 400 
thousand blockchain based transactions per day. This, however, statistically is still insigni-
ficant compared to global payments traffic. Let us, therefore, examine Bitcoin market us-
age in terms of global payment statistics.

Payments 

Consider all non-cash payments, such as cards, bank payments, checks and e-money 
transfers, and compare them with Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain over the follow-
ing timeframe :

Albeit improving every year, the data shows the scale by which the Bitcoin economy lags 
behind fiat in terms of usage. The multiplier value shows the total ‘non-bank’ USD transac-
tion value, divided by the total Bitcoin blockchain USD value.  

Furthermore, by purely looking at the number of transactions per period, the same ‘lag’ 
can be observed. The multiplier below shows the total number of fiat transactions of ‘non-
bank’ institutions, over the total number of Bitcoin transactions recorded on the block-
chain for the year under review [14], [15], which shows Bitcoin transactions growing at a 
steady pace.  2

ted for, due to their untraceable nature, which cannot be traced and made statistically sig-
nificant or relevant on the fiat side.  

From the perspective of ‘payment volumes’ and ‘amounts exchanged’ each day which 
constitutes economic activity, it is fair to conclude that the Bitcoin economy is small, and 
Bitcoin usage has a way to go. 

The Bitcoin Protocol 

It is our belief that the Bitcoin protocol has at its core the right formulae for it to establish 
itself as the leading globally accepted currency. This assumption stems from the bases 
on which Bitcoin was originally conceived by its creator.  [16]  

The original idea for Bitcoin was to create a digital cash equivalent, largely for small non-
reversible payments to enable a cheap, digital medium of exchange. However, given the 
properties of the Bitcoin protocol, it is fit to replace the dominant currencies presently 
used in global trade. 

As global trade is carried out predominantly in US Dollars. The USD monetary system 
dominates world trade in physical goods and derivatives trading alike. By virtue of being 
the dominant currency, it also influences all other national fiat currencies. The most not-
able feature of the USD is called – monetary credit expansion. The USD monetary system 
is governed by The Federal Reserve System of the United States of America.  

Monetary credit expansion is a characteristic of all fiat currencies that are no longer linked 
to commodity money, such as gold - a fixed asset. There used to be a time when gold was 
used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange for trade on markets globally. Before 
the ascent of central banking and fiat currency, gold was used for international trade. 
While debasement has historically been present, due to monopoly rights for coin minting, 
it occurred rarely, usually only when a new king came to power, or a kingdom needed to 
finance a war. The most ruinous effects today, however, constitute the ever expanding 
monetary base of centrally governed monetary systems, synonymous with constant price 
inflation.  

Money is a medium of exchange for goods, not a good in itself. While a nation’s wealth 
increases when more goods are produced, the same cannot be said about the amount of 
money printed. Unlike gold and silver that are favoured for their intrinsic appeal, lustre, or-
namental or industrial value, the initial and sustained demand for Bitcoin stems from a 
deep seated dissatisfaction with the current monetary system. The supply of money is a 
non-issue, as long as it is not meddled with. [17]

Scaling Bitcoin Economy

Bitcoin satisfies all the money and currency prerequisites and thus is bound to replace -- 
or at least strongly compete with -- inflationary monetary systems. Furthermore, by virtue 
of allowing everyone to be their own bank, it eliminates the very ability to expand credit 
and thus does not offer any room for fractional reserve credit.   

Bitcoin can give anyone the ability to trade freely and protect themselves financially 
against corrupt and incompetent governments. [18]  

Bitcoin, as defined at the core of its protocol, is a non-interventionist, decentralised, fixed 
asset currency; one of the most appropriate medium of exchange ever devised by a hu-
man mind. Indeed, Bitcoin even outsmarts the centuries trusted asset - gold as the su-
preme medium of exchange. 

A government can coerce society into using a specific type of money, usually paper bills, 
or electronic equivalents, that are managed by a central bank with the assigned monopoly 
rights to issuance. Bitcoin, however, constitutes a divergence away from such coercive 
notions, going back to historically universally accepted units of exchange, such as gold. 
Thus, let us conclude by examining the basic properties of gold money versus Bitcoin: 

Bitcoin vs. Gold Comparison 

Source: Authors 

These five properties largely define the nature of money, observed by the use of gold 
throughout history - divisibility, portability, scarcity, durability and widespread adoption. 
Bitcoin concurs with these historical properties and has the added benefits of being ex-
tremely portable and instantaneously divisible due to its digital nature. These properties, 
including – scarcity – most importantly, are the underlying features of Bitcoin. Further-
more, the portability of Bitcoin is defined by the network capacity, and not a central gov-
erning body, which allows for the low cost of transactions. These properties are hard-
coded into the Bitcoin protocol and are maintained by the community. The Bitcoin com-

munity that operates and maintains its computational power, act as gatekeepers and en-
sure it remains a healthy monetary system. Bitcoin therefore ticks all the boxes in terms 
of it developing into a stable, non-inflationary currency; a medium of exchange eternally 
sought by peoples since the beginning of trade between individuals and groups.  

Although Bitcoin's digital nature reveals to be the main advantage, it on the other hand 
may prove to be the main disadvantage: if all electronic devices are compromised, or 
cease to exists e.g. due to rare but potentially powerful electromagnetic surge from a sol-
ar storm, it is clear that humanity will have no other recourse for stable medium of ex-
change but gold or its equivalents.

SUCCESS PATH 

Let us first consider Bitcoin’s path of success, by performing a relatively simple set of 
calculations. Then look at the derivatives volumes globally to estimate a successful out-
come for the Globitex exchange as a global spot and derivatives trading venue in the 
making.  

Supposing that the total of world’s monetary unit value, according to the CIA data [20], is 
USD83,558,133,640,000 , of which then Bitcoin usage in terms of market capitalisation 3
constitutes 0.0794%.   4

If, as a result of increased turnover of Bitcoin due to wider usability in exchange traded 
products and global trade, Bitcoin usage increases to at least 5% of total world’s monetary 
value, then Bitcoin would be priced at over USD 250,000 at today’s mined 16.5m+ units, 
and close to USD 200,000, if all 21 million units were mined. In other words, increasing the 
usability of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large, spells an exponential price appreciation 
prospects and eventually a price stability, when market demand meets supply and price 
discovery is enabled on multiple venues linked to various real-life values.  

Indeed, according to the blockchain.info the total USD value of trading volume on major 
Bitcoin exchanges constitutes about 7.6% of total Bitcoin market capitalisation. [15] 

Now, if we suppose that all Bitcoin-related derivatives could constitute at least 1% of total 
currently observed fiat global futures and options market volume, then for a successful 
albeit conservative case in point Globitex, as the first or one of the first derivatives ex-
changes globally, could attain at least 20% of total market share in Bitcoin and cryptocur-
rency spot and derivatives trading, thus attain profitability and therefore attain relative 
success thereto.  

 The CIA numbers for each country include EU region as well as individual EU countries; therefore for precision pur3 -
poses, the  EU number has been subtracted to arrive at a realistic estimate.

 Bitcoin constitutes about 50% of total cryptocurrency market capitalisation. Other major cryptocurrencies: Ethereum, 4
Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, etc.
