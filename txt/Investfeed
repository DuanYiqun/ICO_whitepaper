2. THE PROBLEM 

 

No central hub to buy/sell/exchange, access market data and 
news, or to chat about existing and emerging cryptocurrencies

No dedicated network for enthusiasts and professionals 
globally in the blockchain industry

Cryptocurrencies, especially newer alt coins, suffer 
from lack of exposure, and in turn generate little 
value for those who are not actively using a network

Content creators recognize how advertising may 
diminish their works value to the consumer

Crypto and alt coins information is too fragmented and 
scattered. Centralization is needed

Revenue opportunties for active community contributors are 
weak

3. THE SOLUTION 

We have built a smarter social networking and market access platform (Browser and 

Mobile) for the cryptocurrency community. This will enable the community to establish 

professional relationships, learn, manage their wallets, and exchange ideas. 

  

 

A smarter social networking and 

market access platform for the 

cryptocurrency community.

4. INVESTFEED GOALS 

investFeed plans to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry by bringing transparency and 

ease of use which are currently lacking. Our main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies 

into the traditional financial world and to create a single gateway to the market that is 

open, transparent, and rewards-based for all our users, contributors, and financial 

institutions wherever they may be in the world. 

 

We have been in operation since 2014 and have a fully built-out social investing platform 

with multiple social networking features. This is not a planned product. It exists today. Our 

investFeed Social network app for Android and iOS is available in the respective app 

stores. We have experience and a proven track record maintaining a platform that 

caters to the needs of our users.  

 

Our existing platform has over 15 thousand member sign-ups with over 200 thousand live 

feeds since launch. 78% of our users are experienced traders, 54% are affluent US adults 

($100k+) and 52% are self-employed or founders. This user base can be seamlessly 

converted to our crypto-offering. Again, these are not forecasted user numbers. They 

exist today. Additionally, most crypto-traders invest in traditional financial assets as well 

as cryptocurrencies and so there is a natural synergy between our existing and new 

offering. 

  

We are building a new financial ecosystem, a new way and we want our community to 

be our token holders. As much as we believe in the democratization of digital transacting, 

we also believe in putting the power of our community back into the hands of the 

community. As such, we are going for an ICO Initial Coin Offering and ask you, the crypto-

community to be our supporters.

5. INVESTFEED FEATURES 

investFeed is currently a cross-platform social trading platform in production for US 

Equities, available on Browser, Native iOS, and Native Android. 

  

We aim to transform the existing platform and expand on it, to create a "One Tab" solution 

and dedicated next-generation hub for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency 

industry. investFeed will be the epicenter for cryptocurrency social, market data, crowd 

sentiment, breaking news, information on existing/trending/new projects, as well as have 

integrated asset portfolio/order management and sharing capabilities. 

 

This will be delivered to you via the cryptocurrency epicenter which will feature a range 

of add-on services to improve your experience. All investFeed services are built on the 

Ethereum MainNet - to meet the highest level of security and transparency.

6. INVESTFEED TOKEN 

Ethereum enables the creation of ERC20 tokens, which can be used in an incentive 

system to replace intermediaries. In investFeed’s system, FEED Tokens (IFT) will play a key 

role in providing economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in 

common good. Unlike in Twitter where volunteers must donate their time to contribute 

and validate information, on investFeed’s platform, contributors will be rewarded for their 

work and incentivized to continue increasing the value of the community ecosystem. 

6.1. The Role of FEED Tokens 

 

  

Incentives

•Give and receive 
incentives for great 

content

Purchases

•Purchase premium 
content from other 
members - articles, 

videos & other

•Purchase an ad-free 
experience across the 

platform

Boost

•Promote aka "Boost" 
your content by posting 

a sponsored link or 
video to attract paying 

customers



 

 12 

6.2. FEED Token Marketplace Capabilities 

Every feature in the investFeed platform that gives any added value to its user will require 

payment using FEED Tokens. Every user who facilitates the use of a feature which in turn 

gives added value, will be entitled to receive FEED Token (IFT).  

 

As the network grows, there will be limited token supply versus demand and the value of 

the FEED Token will naturally appreciate, establishing a healthy ecosystem and control 

mechanism that rewards beneficial content and suppresses the noise.  

 

The below are a list of planned initial use cases for the FEED Token. However, this list is not 

exhaustive and as we have done in the past, we will listen and respond to our contributors 

and community network, incorporating their views on how to improve and add more 

value to the platform and the community. 

▪ Members (media outlets, professionals and non-professionals equally) can 

contribute premium content and charge in FEED Token for access 

▪ Promote your own content and profile for network exposure using FEED Token 

▪ Experienced investors and analysts can monetize their knowledge and expertise 

by sharing their ideas, articles, videos, and even portfolio performance and trade 

activity with their subscribers. The FEED Token fee be will determined by the 

content provider and may be set on a time-based subscription level or unlocking 

an individual piece of content 

▪ Users can follow top traders and analysts and news outlets and receive real time 

alerts from those members via in platform notifications, email, SMS, and mobile 

push notifications using FEED Tokens 

▪ FEED Tokens will be required to access the higher levels of advanced trader tools 

▪ FEED Tokens can be used to purchase an ad-free experience from the network

6.3. Token Technology 

Our tokens will be of a standardized ERC20 form, so they can easily be integrated or 

displayable for any other party who wishes to do so. All of this code will be publicly 

available in our repositories and can be audited by anyone who wishes to do so. 

6.4. FEED Token Transaction Mechanics 

Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain all FEED Token (IFT) payment transfers are performed 

in a decentralized, autonomous and completely transparent manner. Sites like 

https://etherscan.io allow you to see and follow transactions on the Ethereum 

blockchain.  

 

We will strive to keep the architectural design and documentation as up to date as 

possible, so everyone can quickly grasp the underlying investFeed architecture. Currently 

we are developing a plan to improve and expand our specific technology stack and the 

full details about the backend solution will be elaborated upon in due course.  

 

The initial marketplace mechanics will be centralized as we require a database where 

we can link contracts to premium content and investFeed products like ad-disabling. Our 

end goal however, is to fully decentralize the investFeed organization and underlying 

database by Q1 2019. 

  

A connection with the Ethereum MainNet will be handled using Parity, which will serve as 

our Ethereum node. This will ensure that our connection to the network is always 

synchronized, and transactions can be processed and validated quickly and securely. A 

React and Web3 stack will be used as our front-end bridge and interface to monitor all 

events in real-time and record them in the database.

1,500 Ethers and maximum 28,000 Ethers (both inclusive) during the token sale & presale. 

The number of tokens issued per Ether will depend on the Ethers raised as per below table. 

You can buy FEED Tokens using any amount of Ethers including a fraction of Ethers like 

0.0023 ETH. We will be offering a discount to early contributors which will decay with 

number of Ethers purchased during the token sale. So, the earlier you purchase, the 

better the token price you will receive. You can also join us in the pre-sale by contacting

site, or earned through a series of bonus / bounty / referral programs or via the investFeed 

platform.

Token sale we have established an escrow arrangement using a Multisig wallet for both 

Bitcoin & Ether.  

  

Ether Multisig Wallet: We will be using standard Ethereum Multisig wallet contract created 

through the Ethereum/Mist Wallet. 

  

Each withdraw from the fund will require 3 out of 4 below signatories to sign the 

withdrawal transaction. Escrow signatories for both the currencies will be:

 27 

Toshendra Sharma & Gary Dmitriev will each receive 0.5% of the amount raised at ICO in 

ETH but with the minimum of 20 Ethers each. This will be treated in the P&L as part of 'cost 

of raising capital' and the escrow fees shall be paid out the day after the ICO has officially 

closed.  

  

They shall be calculated as follows:  

▪ Total raised during ICO x 1% = total escrow fees (of which 1/2 are paid to 

Toshendra & 1/2 to Gary the day following ICO closing).  

  

The remaining balance will constitute the funds the Escrow Signatories will release to the 

project as outlined below.  



 

 28 

9.1. Project Funds Release 

The ICO Balance after escrow fees will be released via Multisig on a 3 of 4 arrangement. 

Funds will be released in 3 stages when the following milestones are met: 

 

1. FEED Token post-Token Sale complete: 50% funds released  

2. Milestone 1: Application Infrastructure integration complete: 25% funds released  

a. investFeed social network application operable, and connected to 

underlying market with live price tracking 

3. Milestone 2: investFeed application live in beta: 25% funds released 

a. investFeed product live in beta, to a designated client’s requirements   

 

Should the circumstance arise where the first milestone has not been met after a period 

of 90 days following completion of the ICO, the REMAINING funds raised will be returned 

to the purchasers.  

9.2. Project Funds Usage 

The proceeds of the funds raised will be used to deliver on our goal of disrupting the 

cryptocurrency industry and create a single gateway to the market that is open, 

transparent, and rewards-based for all our users and contributors. This will entail additional 

human resources within the team to deliver on our development roadmap. Most of the 

funds raised will be allocated to this development task. 

 

We also intend to allocate 20-25% of the raise to marketing in order to drive community 

awareness and grow our community user base. This budget will go towards the creation 

of marketing resources, both in terms of content and ensuring we have the appropriate 

human resources to drive our brand via the appropriate channels. 

 

Over and above development and marketing expenditure, investFeed will incur some 

administration, legal and other operating expenses which will form part of the usage 

budget.

11. DISCLAIMER 

NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FEED TOKEN (IFT) AND 

THE INVESTFEED APPLICATION  

 

Last Updated June 21, 2017  

 

This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or 

solicitation to sell shares or securities in investFeed, Inc. or any related or associated 

company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a confidential offering 

memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities and other laws. None of the 

information or analyses presented are intended to form the basis for any investment 

decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Accordingly, this document 

does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any 

security. This document does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed 

as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, 

any securities, nor should it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in any 

connection with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. InvestFeed expressly 

disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any 

kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information 

contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information 

or (iii) any action resulting therefrom.  

 

The investFeed Token, or “FEED” or “IFT”, is a cryptographic token used by the investFeed 

application.  

 

FEED is not a cryptocurrency.  

At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the 

investFeed platform, IFT cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) IFT has no known 



 

 31 

uses outside the investFeed application, and (iii) IFT cannot be traded on any known 

exchanges.  

 

FEED is not an investment.  

There is no guarantee – indeed there is no reason to believe – that the IFT you purchase 

will increase in value. It may – and probably will at some point – decrease in value. Those 

who do not actually use their IFT honestly and fairly may lose their right to use IFT and may 

lose their IFT to those that do use IFT honestly and fairly.  

 

FEED is not evidence of ownership or right to control. 

Controlling IFT does not grant its controller ownership or equity in investFeed, or the 

investFeed application. IFT does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction 

or decision making of investFeed or the investFeed application. 

 



 

 32 

12. RISK DISCLOSURES 

Risk of Losing Access to FEED Due to Loss of Credentials  

The purchaser’s IFT may be associated with an investFeed account until they are 

distributed to the purchaser. The investFeed account can only be accessed with login 

credentials selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of 

IFT. Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup 

locations geographically separated from the working location.  

 

Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol 

FEED and the investFeed application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any 

malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum 

protocol may cause the investFeed application or IFT to malfunction or function in an 

unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum 

protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to IFT, and also other ways. More information 

about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.  

 

Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials 

Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser’s login credentials or 

private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s IFT. To minimize this risk, the 

purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.  

 

Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions 

Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies 

around the world. The functioning of the investFeed application and IFT could be 

impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or 

restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like IFT, which could impede, 

limit or end the development of the investFeed application.  

 



 

 33 

Risk of Alternative, Unofficial investFeed Application 

Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the investFeed 

platform, it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the 

same open source code and protocol underlying the investFeed application. The official 

investFeed application may compete with these alternative, unofficial IFT-based 

applications, which could potentially negatively impact the investFeed application and 

IFT, including its value.  

 

Risk of Insufficient Interest in the investFeed Application or Distributed 

Applications 

It is possible that the investFeed application will not be used by a large number of 

businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public 

interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of 

interest could negatively impact IFT and the investFeed application.  

 

Risk that the investFeed Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the 

Expectations of investFeed or the Purchaser  

The investFeed application is presently under development and may undergo significant 

changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and 

functionality of the investFeed application or IFT (including participant behavior) held by 

investFeed or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons 

including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation 

plans and execution of the investFeed application.  

 

Risk of Theft and Hacking  

Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the 

investFeed application or the availability of IFT in any number of ways, including service 

attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus based attacks. 

  



 

 34 

Risk of Security Weaknesses in the investFeed Application Core 

Infrastructure Software  

The investFeed application consists of open source software that is based on other open 

source software. There is a risk that the investFeed team or other third parties may 

intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural 

elements of the investFeed application interfering with the use of or causing the loss of 

IFT.  

 

Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of 

Cryptography  

Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum 

computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the investFeed platform, which 

could result in the theft or loss of IFT.  

 

Risk of IFT Mining Attacks  

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain 

used for the investFeed application is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-

spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race 

condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the investFeed application, IFT, 

and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. 

Despite the efforts of the investFeed team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.  

 

Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the investFeed Application  

While IFT should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That value 

may be limited if the investFeed application lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the 

case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform, potentially 

having an adverse impact on IFT.  

 

 

 



 

 35 

Risk of an Illiquid Market for IFT  

There very well may never be a secondary market for IFT. There are currently no 

exchanges upon which IFT would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely be 

relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may, 

therefore, be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges 

for other products and have a negative impact on IFT.  

 

Risk of Uninsured Losses  

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using 

the investFeed application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of 

any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to 

the purchaser.  

 

Risk of Dissolution of the investFeed Project  

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in 

the value of Ether, development issues with the investFeed application, the failure of 

business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the investFeed project 

may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch. 

 

Risk of Malfunction in the investFeed Application  

It is possible that the investFeed application malfunctions in an unfavorable way, 

including one that results in the loss of IFT.  

 

Unanticipated Risks  

Cryptographic Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks 

discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the investFeed team cannot anticipate. 

Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed 

risks or the emergence of new risks.
