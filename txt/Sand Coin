1. Introduction

We are proud to introduce the first ever sand quarry project funded 
through raising cryptocurrency via creating a blockchain option for 
mining non-metallic materials. SAND COIN is a blockchain derivative 
based on a real product.

The goal of the project is to raise funds via a blockchain system and an 
ICO to develop a sand quarry in the Moscow Region. Through creating a 
real product based blockchain option for a low price and issuing SAND 
COIN, which includes entering the cryptocurrency market and 
subsequent buy back, we offer a profitable asset to interested investors.

Objectives:
Raising funds for financing the sand quarry development.
Sand quarry development, building infrastructure and purchase of 
equipment, acquisition of the final required documentation.
Mining and sale of the product
Development of new quarries under the SAND COIN project.
Integration of partners - other sand quarries and non-metallic material 
deposits into SAND COIN.

Positioning:

The creation of a new economic system for the non-metallic material and 
construction business via the blockchain technology, which would allow 
business owners, investors and private entities to participate in the 
development of a new digital economy, for profit.

2. Problems

Moscow and the Moscow Region are one of the most ineffective areas in 
terms of transportation infrastructure and logistics. Millions of people 
are constantly faced with congested highways and motorways, which 
influences business development and ecological situation on a negative 
way. 

At the moment there are several new infrastructure and transport 
projects planned and already underway in Moscow and the Moscow 
Region, which include:
Central Ring Road (ЦКАД) - 525 km in length.
Railroad connection along Central Ring Road
A new highway Moscow - Noginsk - Nizhny Novgorod - Kazan - more than 
800 km in length.

There was also made a decision to demolish old and unfit residential 
property within Moscow, with plans to build new modern housing units 
in place of the demolished ones. This plan was endorsed by President 
Vladimir Putin. There are plans to build 60 million square meters of new 
housing.

Sand is a universal material necessary for building roads, house 
construction, reinforcing new buildings and those under reconstruction. 
More than 150 millions of cubic meters of sand is required for road 
construction just in the immediate vicinity of our sand quarry.

3. The Project

We own a 109 hectare (269,354 acres) plot of land in the Moscow Region. 
The land is situated 60 km away from Moscow and 10 km away from the 
construction site of Central Ring Road junction.

The fortunate transport accessibility and direct proximity to the 
construction of road infrastructure makes our land an attractive area for 
future development into a mortar sand quarry.

This land is valued at $1.8 million as a real estate property, without the 
value of prospective sand mining. 

We have the license from the Russian Federal Subsoil Resources 
Management Agency to prospect subsoil for sand on our land.

Based on the survey made with 16 drill holes on the grid of 300x300 
meters and 5 boreholes on the grid of 300x300 meters, we can evaluate 
the sand resource of the R1 category, and in the near future confirm the 
presence of the sand resource of the S2 category. We have conducted 
appraisal drilling with core extraction and testing samples extraction. 
The drilling was conducted up to 16 meters in depth, and yielded the 
following results:

Topsoil 0,15 meters (stripping 15 centimeters)
Sand, medium and coarse to the depth of up to 16 meters
Water cut from the depth of 4 meters

It’s worth noting that mining would not be conducted on the total area of 
the land plot, but only in the borders of the mining claim so as to comply 
with the legal regulations. In this case the total area of the sand quarry 
development will be 90 hectares (222,39 acres).

The water cut facilitates sand mining via hydromechanical extraction.

The total volume of sand is estimated to be 14.4 million cubic meters.

Extracted and ready for sale product will consist of grade 1 and grade 2 
sand:
Very fine sand - fineness modulus of 1.0 - 1.5
Fine sand - fineness modulus - 1.5 - 2.0
Medium sand - fineness modulus - 2.0 - 2.5
Coarse sand - fineness modulus - 2.5 - 3.0

To supply the mining process we plan to provide 150 kW of electricity. It 
is also worth noting than the necessary infrastructure will include not 
only providing power grids, but the construction of outbuildings:
A building for the sales department, accounting and the administrative 
supply department - 300 square meters.
Housing for the mining staff to provide uninterrupted extraction of non-
metallic materials - 250 square meters

To provide transport infrastructure we plan to build a 500 meters long 
and 8 meters wide asphalt surface entrance complex, which would allow 
year-round sand mining operation.

4. Project implementation plan

Our project is an opportunity to invest into SAND COIN blockchain option 
implemented through a blockchain platform and based on a real product 
- cubic meters of mortar sand.

The total volume of sand is estimated to be 14.4 million cubic meters.
The average market price of 1 cubic meter of sand is $5.30.

Estimated total earnings of the quarry - 14 400 000 m3 * $5.30 = $76 320 
000.

The volume of sand sold during pre-ICO and ICO - 3.4 million m3 = 3 400 
000 SAND COIN. The price offered to investors during crowdsale $0.95 - 
$1.35 = 1 m3 ($0.95 - $1.35 = 1 SAND COIN).

Fundamental stages of the project:

Pre-ICO. July - August 2017.
During the pre-ICO investors will be offered to purchase a block-chain 
option of 230 000 cubic meters of sand (230 000 SAND COIN)
1 SAND COIN = $0.95

2) ICO. September - October 2017
During the ICO investors will be offered to purchase a block-chain option 
of 3 170 000 cubic meters of sand (3 170 000 SAND COIN)
1 SAND COIN = $1.25 - $1.35

The minimal milestone of the ICO - $1 175 000

3) Connecting power grids, construction of the infrastructure necessary 
for sand mining, purchase of equipment.
October 2017 - April 2018

4) Conducting stripping work, the beginning of quarry development 
May 2018

5) The buy back launch
July 2018

SAND COIN blockchain options buy back will start 9 months after 
fundraising ends. We plan to buy back 10% of SAND COIN with 
subsequent burning every year, until buying back up to 50% SAND COIN 
from the market. Investors will also have the right to exchange SAND 
COIN for an equivalent amount of cubic meters of sand (1 SAND COIN = 1 
m3 of sand).

6) Partnering up with other non-metallic material quarries, connecting 
them to the SAND COIN system, February 2019

7) Launching the development of a second sand quarry, 2020

5. Financials

The project plan requires two stages of sand quarry development.

First stage includes:
Legal documentation preparation
Connecting to the power grid, lighting
Entrance complex construction
Outbuildings construction

First stage expenses - $1 175 000

Second stage includes:
Stripping works
Purchase of equipment
Purchase of vehicles for sand transportation

Second stage expenses - $2 353 600.

Monthly expenses: sand mining, staff salary, administrative costs - $95 
000.

Monthly earnings based on an average of 90 000 m3 of sand mined (3000 
m3 a day) and an average market price of $5.30 for 1 m3 of sand - 90 000 
* 5.30 = $477 000.

Mining 1 cubic meter of sand costs $1.25. The mining expenses will be 
gradually reduced throughout quarry development and equipment 
investment recoupment. 

At the average rate of 90 000 m3 of sand mined monthly, the quarry will 
be depleted in 13.5 years. After this we plan to start working on 
recultivating the land for fish farming or other appropriate economic 
activities.

During pre-ICO we offer investors a way to earn a substantial profit as 
soon as SAND COIN enters the market, considering the price of 1 SAND 
COIN (equivalent to 1 m3 of sand) during crowdsale = $0.95 - $1.35. 
Average market price of 1 m3 of mortar sand = $5.30.



sand coin 10

Based on this form of investment we expect a substantial increase in 
value as soon as SAND COIN enters the market, and equalization of the 
blockchain price later on, once the quarry development begins.

We expect SAND COIN to increase in value even more due to the buy 
back in July 2018.
Other price growth stages will happen due to the partnerships with other 
non-metallic material miners and their participation in SAND COIN in 
February 2019, and the launch of a second quarry development in 2020.

6. The team

Our team consists of  builders, both open and closed pit sand mining 
specialists, engineers, non-metallic material quarrying specialists. 
chemists and managers with extensive experience in their fields.

We have built more than 2500 low-rise houses and sold more than 2000 
hectares (4942,1 acres) of land. We have built and brought into service a 
facility for environmentally-friendly brick production from natural 
materials. Thanks to the efforts of our chemists working with Dmitry 
Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia and Moscow 
Automobile and Road Construction State Technical University we have 
created and implemented a new road construction technology, using 
recycled industrial production waste. With this technology we have built 
more than 100 km of roads. Our engineers participate in Russian forums 
and exhibitions, implementing new construction material technologies 
including those than use mortar sand.

ICO organizers have more than 15 years of experience in the 
construction market. We work with major road construction companies, 
residential developers in Moscow and state-owned construction 
companies.

Our experience and competence allow us to have full confidence that our 
goals will be reached. Considering the growing demand for non-metallic 
materials, we can assure you that SAND COIN will be implemented by 
professionals and will be in demand for years to come.

7. Conclusion

Construction market in the Moscow region is rapidly growing with each 
year, and with it grows the demand for construction materials such as 
mortar sand. Construction of new infrastructure projects such as Central 
RIng Road and extensive residential development in Moscow are the 
source of our confidence in the steady demand for our product for many 
years to come.

We offer investors an opportunity to purchase the mortar sand 
blockchain option for a lowered price. During the crowdsale the product 
will be available for the following price: 1 SAND COIN = 1 m3 of mortar 
sand = $0.95 - $1.35, with the average market price of 1 m3 mortar sand 
being $5.30. Moreover, we plan to buy back up to 50% of SAND COIN 
from the market over the course of the next 5 years to increase 
investors’ profits and support demand. 

Attracting other conservative non-metallic material market actors to 
work with us within the SAND COIN system is our more ambitious goal. 
With the advent of blockchain technologies the world is changing, and 
the ways of fundraising change as well. We strive to keep up with the 
latest advancements and wish to offer our partners a way to become a 
part of this new 
technological paradigm of relationships between private individuals and 
businesses.

Being confident that our current mining capacity is not enough to satisfy 
the growing demand in our region, we plan to launch the development of 
a second sand quarry within two years.

The ideal scenario for us is to see the whole of our country’s conservative 
industry and businesses move forward and embrace blockchain 
technologies and ways of fundraising. Our goal is to become the 
foundation of this change by being the first company raising funds for 
mining non-metallic materials through holding an ICO. Join us in this 
brave new world, where even the most conservative and close-minded 
markets embrace innovation and change.
