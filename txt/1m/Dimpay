DIMPAY Whitepaper
Abstract

DIMPAY is a global payment system that is built on the NEM blockchain. The use of 
blockchain technology makes the platform less expensive, instantaneous, transparent  
and it eliminates third parties. The platform is designed for peer-to-peer, business- 
to-business, consumer-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. DIMPAY 
is an integral part of the DIM Ecosystem and it consists of DEPOTWALLET, mobile 
DEPOTWALLET and the DIM Debit Card. DEPOTWALLET allows users to buy, sell, hold 
and manage cryptocurrencies and cryptonized assets. The DIM Debit Card will allow 
consumers to engage in e-commerce and walk-in purchases at merchant shops. The 
DEPOTWALLET Business Account will allow merchants to generate invoices, track 
inventory, make payments and much more. DIMPAY will facilitate cashless transactions 
for consumers and merchants. However, the payment system is not only for consumers 
and merchants; it has the potential to be a financial solution for the 2 billion adults who 
do not have bank accounts around the world.

Risk Disclaimer: Buying DIMCOIN involves substantial risk of loss and it is not suitable for every investor. The 

valuation of DIMCOIN may fluctuate, and as a result, participants may lose more than their original investment.  

Before deciding to participate in the DIMPAY ICO, potential participants must carefully consider  their invest-

ment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite.

1. Introduction

“The true sign of intelligence is 
not knowledge, but imagination”

Albert Einstein

Since the beginning of time, humanity has strived to simplify the process of exchanging 
goods and services. Initially, humanity used to engage in warfare to access goods and 
services that were not readily available. Besides warfare, bartering was the most basic 
form of payment and it laid the foundation for other payment methods.  The payment 
evolution continued. After bartering came hard currencies, paper currencies, credit/debit 
cards, mobile payments and lastly interaction-less payments found in services such as 
Uber. As the payment systems evolved into the financial technology (fintech) behemoth 
that we know and understand today, a need for financial institutions serving as trusted 
third parties to process electronic parties also arose. The introduction of more players in 
the payment system resulted in the whole system being held together by the notion of 
trust. Humanity had to trust the financial institutions that facilitated their finances.

The 2008 global financial crises proved that the notion of trust is very fragile. People like 
Satoshi Nakamoto realized that “what is needed is an electronic payment system ba-
sed on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact 
directly with each other without the need for a ‘trusted’ third party”1 . Such a need did 
not only result in Bitcoin but a technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a decentrali-
zed ledger system that eliminate third parties and it has enhanced security enforced by 
cryptography. Transactions done on the blockchain are peer-to-peer (P2P), immutable 
and irreversible. Blockchain is also the underlying technology behind DIMPAY.

The DIMPAY Foundation is a separate entity from the DIM Foundation. The DIMPAY 
Foundation will have its own board members and employees. The DIM Foundation  
will offer full support to the DIMPAY Foundation as a pilot project. DIMPAY will operate 
independently within the DIM Ecosystem. The DIM Foundation has permitted the  
development of DIMPAY to be outsourced exclusively to the DIMPAY Foundation.  
This is to ensure that the DIM Ecosystem is decentralized, not just at the foundational 
blockchain level but the operational level too.

DIMPAY is a global payment system that is fast, inexpensive and fully secure. DIMPAY is 
part of the DIM Ecosystem and it is built on the NEM Protocol. DIMPAY aims to disrupt 
the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer 
(B2C) and consumer-to-business (C2B) payment systems by offering low fees, transpa-
rency, instantaneous transactions and a decentralized platform. The use of DIMPAY will 
eliminate numerous payment errors that occur with brick and mortar merchants. This 
will be achieved by scanning a Quick Response (QR) code from their mobile devices 
instead of using cashiers. QR codes are two-dimensional codes that “were invented as 
an advancement of the common one dimensional barcodes”2.

There are forms of codes such as the “3D codes with the additional dimension co-
lour-depth and 4D codes with multi-sequential display”3 but the QR code is the main 
focus since it has mass adoption. The QR codes are read by imaging devices such as 
cameras in hand held devices such as mobile phones and tablets. According to Cisco’s 
Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, global mobile traffic grew by 63% in 2016 
reaching 7.2 exabytes (7.2 billion gigabytes) per month at the end of 2016 and that was 
up from 4.4 exabytes per month at the end of 20154.  The monthly global mobile data 
traffic is expected to be 49 exabytes by 2021 and mobile devices will represent 20% of 
the total Internet Protocol (IP) traffic; with smartphones accounting for over 50% of 
global devices and connections5. As mobile devices continue to increase with populari-
ty, the adoption of QR codes and mobile payments will increase. DIMPAY is positioning 
itself for this anticipated mobile usage boom.

The QR code will be the foundation for P2P, B2B and B2C experience using DIMPAY.  
The use of the QR code will eliminate the need for numerous participants such as 
cashiers in the payment process. The elimination of numerous participants will lead 
to decreased costs and increased efficiency and savings for both consumers and 
merchants.

DEPOTWALLET is a web app blockchain based wallet that permits users to buy, sell, 
hold and manage various cryptocurrencies together with cryptonized assets. The 
wallet allows users to make P2P transfers and companies to make B2B transactions. 

DEPOTWALLET is also a doorway for users and businesses to the Hybrid Stock 
Exchange (HYBSE). HYBSE is an online stock exchange that offers small and medium 
enterprises (SME’s) a platform to seek and access international capital.

The mobile DEPOTWALLET will be similar to the DEPOTWALLET. Users will be able 
to select a Private Account or a Business Account. The introduction of the mobile  
DEPOTWALLET will proceed in gradual steps. The first mobile DEPOTWALLET will  
be a basic version for beta testing. The security upgrades and software updates to  
the mobile DEPOTWALLET will happen throughout 2018 and 2019. As the software 
matures, the latest and most advanced security systems will be integrated.  
Examples: fingerprint, iris scan, face recognition, 2-step authenticator.

12

The Private Account will offer the user full control over the account. The account will 
be linked to the DEPOTWALLET account, this will enable users to manage the crypto-
nized assets and cryptocurrencies in the account’s wallet address.  Users will be able 
to make e-commerce purchases and merchant walk-in purchases in brick and mortar 
shops. This will “allow consumers to make payments ‘anytime, anywhere’, becoming 
less dependent on the need to carry cash which in turn could reduce the risk of theft”6.

The primary functions of the Private Account will be as follows:

Engage in point of sale payments

Engage in carrier payments 

View and manage the funds and cryptonized assets in the DEPOTWALLET 
account

Make everyday transactions like sending remittance

Standing orders of recurring payments such as rent, insurance etc.

Direct debit procedures (creditors deduct the amount directly from the DE-
POTWALLET account)

Guarantees (such as a bank guarantee issued to a creditor)

Additional functions can be added at any stage

3.2.1 Private Account

3.2.2 Functions of Private Account

DIMPAY Whitepaper
3.2.1 Private Account  



13

The Business Account will be designed to meet the needs of businesses. The Business 
Account will enable businesses to keep track of inventory and transactions through 
one account. They will have complete management over their customers’ shopping  
and checkout experiences. The Business Account will send merchants payment no-
tifications when payments have been completed and credited to their accounts. The 
account holders can also decide when to receive the notifications. The account will 
allow for standard invoices to be generated. Standard invoices have basic details such 
as the unique invoice number and transaction details such as items purchased, total 
cost etc. As DIMPAY continues to evolve, we will investigate the possibility and practi-
cality of adding more types of invoices such as progress invoices, commercial invoices, 
value-based billing, time-based billing etc. The addition of various billing options will 
widen the pool for businesses beyond merchants and venture into different professio-
nal fields.

The primary functions of the Merchant Account will be as follows:

Check balance of the funds in the account

Track the income and expenditure from the account

Create an invoice

Statement of financial positions (balance sheet, cash flow)

Receive invoice status updates

Salary payments

Expense payments

3.2.3 Business Account

3.2.4 Functions of Business Account

DIMPAY Whitepaper
3.2.3 Business Account   



14

Merchants will receive payments from customers through QR codes. When merchants 
create an invoice, a new QR code will be generated. The QR code will be displayed 
at the counter in a physical shop, whilst an online store will have their QR code dis-
played on their webpage at the end of the purchase when you check-out. A merchant 
needs to have a free Business Account on Depowallet in order to be part of the DIM 
Ecosystem. Every merchant will have a free unique QR code that is linked to their 
Business Account. When a customer makes a purchase they will use their phones to 
scan the merchants  QR code and transfer the relevant amount in DIM Currencies to 
the merchant‘s Business Account. Merchants need a Business Account to receive DIM 
Currencies as payment for their products. For merchants to withdraw their DIM Curren-
cies, they will need to register with WISE Consulting Ltd, they will be required to fill in 
a know your customer (KYC) form.

If a sale does not proceed in a manner that both the consumer and merchant were 
anticipating, they can enter into a Dispute Resolution Dialogue (DRD). The DRD is a bi-
partisan (two-way) private chat between the consumer and the merchant. If the consu-
mer is the aggrieved party, they can initiate the dialogue with the relevant merchant. If 
the merchant is the aggrieved party, the merchant can initiate the dialogue. 
The consumer and merchant engage with each other to find a possible resolution. 

If a resolution cannot be found, one or both parties can choose to escalate the matter 
into the Dispute Resolution Negotiations (DRN). A DRN is a tripartite (three-way) dia-
logue that involves a DIMPAY Foundation Ambassador from their respective country. 
The ambassador will also act herein as the arbitrator. The merchants will be directed to 
refund the consumer in case the Ambassador finds against their case.

If the Ambassador cannot resolve the disagreement, the matter can be escalated to 
the DIMPAY Foundation. The DIMPAY Foundation will view the matter and try to assist 
by  offering an opinion on the dispute. If one or both parties are still not satisfied, the 
matter can be escalated to the DIMPAY Foundation members. The DIMPAY Foundation 
members will then vote on the opinions received from the DIMPAY Foundation and 
offer their opinions. If one or both parties do not accept the opinions and assistance 
from the DIMPAY Foundation members, they can submit the matter to the competent 
court in order to resolve the dispute.

The DIM Debit Card will be connected to the DEPOTWALLET account on the web app 
and mobile versions. Debit card holders will be able to convert their DIMCOIN and 
other cryptocurrencies into selected DIM Currencies such as the DIM GBP and DIM 
EURO. The DIM Currencies will enable debit card holders to walk into brick and mortar 
merchants and swipe for goods and services. The debit card will also enable the hol-
ders to engage in e-commerce shopping.

Debit cards offer a level of convenience of swiping at stores, 
performing online purchases etc.

No limit for online use

Debit cards for (one-time) use can be generated directly through 
DEPOTWALLET and mobile DEPOTWALLET

They provide some level of security because the holders do 
not have to carry cash on them

Debit cards are readily accepted globally

If the card is lost or stolen, other people can’t access the account 
without the PIN

You can create your own PIN

Users can only spend money that they currently have in their accounts 
unlike with credit cards where users can spend funds on credit

ATM fees

The responsibility for balancing the account by managing spending 
habits falls on the user 

Accessing funds requires a pin code

The debit cards will give the holders the convenience to use ATMs. ATMs will enable 
debit card holders to withdraw their DIM Currencies to traditional fiat currencies in 
different geographical locations around the globe.

6. Why use DIMPAY?

“When something is important 
enough, you do it even if the odds 

are not in your favor”

Elon Musk



24

DIMPAY does not intend to disrupt the manner in which consumers and merchants pro- 
cess payments. DIMPAY intends to cryptonize and digitize payment processes in order 
to have cashless transactions. DIMPAY uses blockchain to cryptonize the payment pro-
cess that is familiar to both consumers and merchants. The familiar payment process for 
consumers involves paying for an item using the local fiat currency, such as the Euro or 
Indian Rupee. The traditional payment process for merchants is receiving payment for 
their inventory using a local currency. Local currencies make their accounting easier to 
manage. 

Making the payment process easier is possible through the use of DIM Currencies. DIM 
Currencies are a cryptonized version of fiat currencies. After they have been cryptonized, 
they are referred to as DIM EURO for the Euro and DIM Rupee for the Indian Rupee. The 
DIM Currencies are pegged to the market value of the respective fiat currencies. Later 
in 2018, users will be able to exchange their DIMCOIN and XEM (NEM) for different DIM 
Currencies, then they can scan a QR code to make payments. 

For example, Kimesha wants to buy her favourite sandwich which costs €4 but she does 
not have any fiat money in her wallet. She signs into her mobile DEPOTWALLET and her 
account  has 4 DIM EURO, Kimesha simply scans the merchant’s QR code to pay for her 
sandwich*. The merchant receives 4 DIM EURO into their business account. By receiving 
the DIM EURO, the merchant is shielded from the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The 
merchant can have a reliable and stable revenue forecast for their business. Merchants 
will be able to withdraw fiat currencies equivalent to the DIM Currencies in their Business 
Accounts from WISE Consulting Ltd (WISE Consulting Ltd intends to act as bureau de 
change for the DIM Ecosystems). WISE Consulting will arrange for the transfer of the 
withdrawn amount into the merchant’s bank account**.

The use of DIM Currencies protect both the consumer and merchant from price volatili-
ty and they also simplify the process of purchasing using cryptocurrencies. Using other 
cryptocurrency payment systems, Kimesha will, for example, have to send 0.00072 BTC 
(Bitcoin) for her sandwich. The merchant will receive the amount in BTC after costs have 
been deducted and will have to do their invoices with such amounts. DIM Currencies 
allow the merchant to do invoices using the figures received. Kimesha can also exchange 
her DIMCOIN for DIM Currencies and use the DIM Debit Card to swipe for her sandwich.

*The amount will include fees for transferring DIM Currencies to the merchant

**There are fees associated with fiat currency withdrawals from WISE Consulting

7. DIMPAY Benefits

“It’s easy to quote motivation, 
but you still need motivation 

to master the quote”

Wayde van Niekerk



26

DIM Currencies are the medium of exchange when using DIMPAY. DIM Currencies allow 
users to walk into shops and pay for everyday items. DIM Currencies can be understood 
by the general public because they are digital versions of the currencies they are aware 
of. DIM Currencies have the potential to make the general public comfortable with crypto- 
currencies and blockchain as they are easy to understand and use. Users can transfer 
their DIM Currencies onto their DEPOTWALLET and transact without going to a bureau 
de change, queue in long lines and pay high fees and commissions. The conversion 
of fiat currencies into DIM Currencies allows the user to get the actual value of the 
cryptocurrencies they convert. Users will also be able to convert cryptocurrencies into 
different DIM Currencies.

DIM Currencies give DEPOTWALLET users access to the Hybrid Stock Exchange (HYBSE). 
By using DIM Currencies users are able to purchase cryptonized securities such as 
Exchange Traded Commodities (ETC), Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), company shares 
and others.

There are incentives for +50 DIM TOKEN holders with the introduction of DIMPAY. 
Some of the fees earned on DIMPAY will go to +50 DIM TOKEN holders. DIM TOKEN 
and DIMCOIN holders will automatically get access to DIMPAY by already having a  
DEPOTWALLET account. They will not need to do anything as the payment system  
will be automatically added to their DEPOTWALLETs. The increased usage and success 
of DIMPAY has the potential to trickle down and increase the value of the DIM TOKENs 
and DIMCOINs.

Merchants will be able to use the Business Account for free for one year. After one 
year there will be fees for using all the functions from the Business Account. 

The free Business Account will have the following features:

Check balance of the funds in the account

Track income and expenditure from the account

Create invoice

Salary payments

Bill payments

Standing orders of recurring payments such as rent, insurance etc.

Direct debit procedures (creditors deduct amounts directly from  
DEPOTWALLET accounts)

Guarantees (such as a bank guarantee issued to a creditor)

The DIM community will be able to vote as to which package will be offered to 
merchants. The DIM community will vote by sending 1 DIMCOIN to the respective  
wallet address for the different packages. The funds from the voting process will  
be sent to the +50 DIM TOKENs payout wallet address.

The Business Account will have one of the following packages:

Free use for one year. After a year, if merchants invite five other merchants  
per annum to use DIMPAY and they get another year free

Free use for one year. There after merchants will then pay 1000 DIMCOIN  
per annum to have full access to the Business Account

37

The payment system has gone through great technological changes over the past few 
centuries. The fundamental need to transact with other people has not changed. With 
the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the use of blockchain as a basis for the payment 
was inevitable. DIMPAY is a web and mobile based payment option that incorporates 
point of sale purchases through the DIM Debit Card. The web and mobile payments are 
possible through the use of DEPOTWALLET. As the world moves towards a cashless 
society, DIMPAY will be a platform where consumers and merchants will be able to 
facilitate trade even when they are not in the same shop, country, region or continent. 
E-commerce allows for cross-border trading at the comfort of one’s home. DIMPAY 
through the DEPOTWALLET, mobile DEPOTWALLET and DIM Debit Card will make the 
purchases easier not only for users in the DIM Ecosystem, but for general public that 
will adopt it.

4. RISK FACTORS

Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risks.

Buying DIMCOIN involves substantial risk of total loss and it is not suitable for every 
investor. The valuation of DIMCOIN may fluctuate, and as a result, participants may lose 
more than their original investment or the whole investment. Before deciding to parti-
cipate in the DIMPAY ICO, potential participants must carefully consider  their invest-
ment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. You acknowledge and agree that 
there are risks associated with purchasing DIMCOINs, holding  DIMCOINs , and using 
DIMCOINs, as disclosed in the Whitepaper. BY PURCHASING DIMCOIN, YOU EXPRESS-
LY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE RISKS, including but not limited to 
the risks described below:

4.1 Dependence on computer infrastructure 
The DIMPAY Foundation’s dependence on functioning software applications, computer 
hardware and the Internet implies that DIMPAY Foundation can offer no assurances 
that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of your DIMCOINs. Despite 
DIMPAY Foundation’s implementation of all reasonable network security measures, its 
processing center servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic 
break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other 
disruptions caused by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of 
services, which would limit the use of the DIMCOINs. 

4.2 Regulatory risks 
The issue of tokens and Coins may be a new concept in some jurisdictions, which may 
then apply existing laws or introduce new regulations regarding these applications, and 
such regulations may conflict with the current DIMPAY Foundation concept. This may 
result in the need to make substantial modifications, including but not limited to the 
DIMPAY ICO termination, the loss of DIMCOINs, and the suspension or termination of 
all ICO’s.

4.3 Force Majeure

the Foundation and shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disor-
ders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other 
failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal 
governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond the Foundation‘s control, which 
were not in existence at the time of White Paper release. 

4.4 Value of DIMCOINs 
Once purchased, the value of DIMCOINs may significantly fluctuate due to various rea-
sons. The DIMPAY Foundation does not guarantee any specific value of the DIMCOIN 
over any specific period of time. The DIMPAY Foundation shall not be held responsible 
for any change in the value of DIMCOINs.

foreseen by its team at this time.
