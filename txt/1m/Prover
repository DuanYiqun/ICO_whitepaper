1. Introduction 

We live in the world of rapidly evolving technology, which dictates new 

consumption patterns and communication culture bringing faster, cheaper and 

more convenient ways for people to interact with each other and get 

services from vendors. On the other hand, this new environment leaves 

concerning possibilities for exploiting these new forms of communication 

against its adopters threatening to undermine the trust between the members 

of the new digital society. New security solutions are required to address 

these concerns and eliminate the risks of fraud and disinformation in the 

market. 

 

We present PROVER – an open source decentralized Blockchain platform for 

verification of authenticity of user generated video files. The purpose of 

PROVER is to eliminate forgery of video materials and confirm their 

authenticity using video analysis algorithms and Blockchain. 

2. The Background of the Dilemma 

Growing affordability of smartphone devices contributes to its massive 

adoption worldwide. The average price of an android smartphone in 2016 was 

$208 compared to $380 5 years ago, which translates into 11.4% annual 

decrease in price. This resulted in YoY increase in a number of smartphones 

users by 12% in 2016 and 25% in 2015 respectively reaching 1.48 bln units 

in January – August, 2017. The estimated total number of smartphone users 

globally is of around 2.9 bln. There is hardly any country in the world 

that does not have a significant smartphone users’ community. 

 

These fundamentals shape the behavioral patterns of younger generations and 

significantly influence those of older generations. In 2016 average US 

citizen preferred to spend almost 13% of his lifetime looking at smartphone 

screen. The vast majority of that time is dedicated to social networking 

and direct communication. People value their time more than ever and often 

prefer texting and video messaging instead of calling or meeting in person.  

 

It is only natural that many project these habits and patterns on other 

spheres of life and business and request a similar functionality from their 

counterparts. Many businesses are facing a sharp need to pursue 

digitalization in order to retain clients. Many large corporations are 

allocating increasingly high budgets in 2016 to develop new client-oriented 



 

products and solutions that would fit in the new digital paradigm (bring 

examples). Others are falling behind and lose their market share to new 

ventures oriented on digital audience from day one. 

 

This tendency supports creation of a vast amount of user generated video 

content, for example – a trend that has become a phenomenon in recent years 

shaking media, news, education and entertainment industries all over the 

globe. Moreover, such video content is also required and actively relied on 

in financial, insurance, judicial, medical and other industries. 

 

However, the authenticity of such digital video recordings, when it comes 

to correct depiction of the events and facts of commercial and legal nature 

can often be questioned due to multiple ways of manipulating, editing and 

faking the video files. There are multiple ways of compromising the 

authenticity of the user generated video recordings, including but not 

limited to using a virtual camera (emulator), changing the date of the 

recording, artificially altering the video. 

 

In this regard, there is a fundamental need for an independent, 

decentralized service that will objectively guarantee the authenticity of 

the created video content and protect it from a possible forgery and unfair 

editing. PROVER platform relies on Ethereum Blockchain to guarantee the 

authenticity of the video recording referencing to a specific time of the 

recording and its authenticity. We expect PROVER solution to make a serious 

positive impact on the development of the digital economy and help 

thousands of businesses from dozens of different areas as well as make the 

lives of their clients easier. 

3. Existing solutions 

3.1. Online Content Protection Solutions 

The authenticity of the content and the rights to it (copyright) today are 

mostly being approved at the level of platforms for storing and 

demonstrating video materials. An example of such a solution is Google 

content ID, which allows only to confirm the time of downloading a video on 

YouTube, this is the basis for the assumption of its originality, based on 

the principle of presumption of authorship (a person is considered as an 

author until the real author disputes this fact). 

  



 

The drawback of this and similar solutions is that they do not allow to 

restore the time of real video recording, its originality, and integrity. 

In addition, these solutions work within their platforms "only on YouTube" 

are provided manually by service administrators upon application and always 

depend on the opinion of the service administrators. That is, there is 

always a place for the human factor - subjectivity or simply error. And 

with annoying truth seekers, the conversation is short - "Content owners 

who repeatedly filed unreasonable complaints can lose the right to use 

Content ID and lose their YouTube partner status." 

  

The authors try to protect the content by watermarks and logos on the video 

screen, but this can only help them in the subsequent contestation of its 

authorship, but not to prove the fact of forgery. That means that in legal 

and financial matters this approach is completely inapplicable. 

3.2. Blockchain-based Solutions for Copyright Protection and 

Video Hashing 

As of today, there is a various number of online electronic notary 

services, which make it possible to certify the existence and the 

authorship for all kinds of files, documents and digital content. Among 

them: 

● Block Notary - a service that helps to create "Proof of existence" of 

any content (photos, files, any media) using the TestNet3 or Bitcoin 

network. The frontend system is a mobile application for iOS that 

registers a document hash in a blockchain. 

● Emercoin DPO Antifake - technology based on the Emer platform allows 

to create a unique digital passport for the item (product) stored in 

a decentralized database - blockchain, and provides services for 

managing this passport. It is focused mainly on the offline segment - 

it helps to register individual details (VIN, IMEI numbers) in the 

system  in order to protect real goods from fraud. 

● Stampery - blockchain technology, that can verify e-mail or any 

files. This simplifies the process of verifying letters by simply 

sending them by email to a specially created mailing address for each 

customer. Law firms use Stampery technology for a very cost-effective 

way of document verification. 

● https://www.ascribe.io/ - service for copyright registration , 

further control and distribution of digital content. It is positioned 

for digital works of art. It offers to register a work, put it on 

http://www.blocknotary.com/timestamp.html
https://wiki.emercoin.com/en/EMC_Antifake
https://stampery.com/
https://www.ascribe.io/


 

sale in a secure marketplace, and then monitor its use 

(demonstration). 

● https://letsnotar.me/ - an easy service that automatically stores a 

hash of files that were uploaded in it   in  blockchain. It can  

launch on a smartphone, allows to get access to the camera, take 

photos and videos and hash them. However, it can not guarantee that 

the video is recorded from a real, not a virtual camera - so it does 

not protect against forgery. 

● TrueRec – a service used to verify digital credentials. When someone 

shares his or her credentials from the TrueRec app on a  mobile 

device, the recipient can be sure that credentials are trustworthy 

because TrueRec is powered by blockchain. Records are easily 

verifiable and sensitive information is protected. 

● Verif-y – system that gives its users the power to own, manage and 

communicate their digital identities and verified credentials, and 

gives entities an interface and layer of trust to provide and request 

PII data. Importantly, with Verif-y, all communication of PII is 

exclusively governed by the users, something not available until now. 

● APPII – blockchain platform that is used to verify career credentials 

and CVs. APPII uses biometrical identification to protect its members 

from individuals looking to hijack profiles and act falsely on behalf 

of someone else. 

● PO.ET - is a shared, universal ledger designed to track ownership and 

attribution for the world's digital creative assets. Platform is 

based on Bitcoin blockchain. 

 

Also there is a number of video sharing and video streaming services, which 

are based on blockchain technology and could verify ownership of each 

video. The most interesting and widespread are: 

● LIVEPEER – first project aims to deliver a cryptoeconomically 

incentivized protocol and open media server for live video 

broadcasting. Broadcaster sends video into LIVEPEER network, which 

transcodes video into all formats and bitrates and distributes to end 

users. 

● Flixxo – system where all users could share any content they have on 

their device with the rest of the community. Flixxo is peer-to-peer 

blockchain based platform where every user turns itself into a 

distributor of content and every author is able to upload content and 

set the rules of the distribution;

https://truerec.io/
https://www.verif-y.io/

https://livepeer.org/
https://www.flixxo.com/


 

● Viuly – is a video sharing platform with open source code, which is 

based on Ethereum blockchain smart contract. Video content storage is 

decentralized. Main key features of this platform are: upload and 

manage access to video content, support and donate to video creators; 

● CoinTube – is a private decentralized video system. The service will 

include a web version, Android/iOS application, and software 

solutions. System uses Ethereum for decentralized smart contract 

logic and Swarm for decentralized storage system. 

  

Neither of these services were designed to guarantee the originality of 

uploaded or hashed files, integrity, and authenticity of the video. They do 

not protect users and clients against forgery because they do not carry the 

technology to verify the video recording process. PROVER platform 

technology guarantees that the video was recorded app at a specific time 

from a camera of a particular device, to ensure that there are no signs of 

forgery and editing. 

  

PROVER technology on the other hand can become a functional addition to the 

services discussed above and enhance the level of trust to them. Having the 

opportunity to guarantee the authenticity of the recorded video files, 

these services could, for example, provide services for notarization of the 

authenticity of video statements and video materials. 

4. What is PROVER? 

The PROVER service consists of several components: 

● A mobile app that installs on a smartphone and launches with the 

camera turned on or initiates the launch of the camera itself. 

● A set of algorithms and utilities for integrating PROVER technology 

into third-party solutions and services. 

● On-chain part - PROOF smart contract (only for implementation based 

on the Ethereum platform). 

● Off-chain part consists of  frontend, backend, scripts and utilities 

for working with Ethereum and NEM blockchains. 

  

The main scientific and technical problem, the solution of which is the 

heart of the project, is the verification of user generated video files. 

During verification, the system confirms that: 

● Video footage is produced by a real video camera integrated into the 

mobile device, and not emulated by a virtual video camera. 

https://viuly.com/
https://cointube.org/


 

● The video material is complete, not edited, without gluing and 

insertions. 

● The record was made in a certain period of time. 

 

All source codes will be placed in the public repository at 

https://github.com/proverproject. 

4.1. Swype code verification (Prover SWYPE ID application)  

Video verification is based on the algorithm for automatic swype code 

detection in a video stream. Opposed  to  the classical swype code, which 

is being entered by moving user's finger on the touch screen forming a 

continuous line connecting the points shown on the screen, in PROVER 

technology the swype code is being entered by moving the smartphone with 

the camera in a record mode. The video analytics module that analyzes the 

video stream from the smartphone camera will be able to detect the 

direction of movement of the smartphone, and therefore build a virtual line 

of swype code that must intersect the virtual points in the required 

sequence in the field of three lines by three points in each. 

 
In other words, the user sees a grid of 9 points by 3 points in a row, a 

swype code for input generated in a blockchain, and the current point from 

which the input of the swype code begins. To enter the swype code, the user 

needs to move the phone in a space so as  the virtual swype code line 

https://github.com/isvirin/prover


 

travels along the required path. After the code is entered, the grid 

disappears and a notification appears that the code has been entered 

correctly. 

 

Automatic swype code recognition algorithm based on video analysis will 

allow users at the stage of video recording to be sure that later, if there 

will be a need to check the video for authenticity, this swype code will be 

recognized by the service. 

 

 An illustrative and simplified operational cycle of the SWYPE ID 

application is presented below. 

1. User follows the app instructions and moves the smartphone up, down, 

left, right or diagonal in a certain pattern before, during or after 

the recording (maintaining the integrity of the recording). 

2. If user follows the instructions correctly SWYPE ID creates a unique 

video sequence with embedded smartphone camera movements and hashes 

the file, creating a unique digital number. 

3. SWYPE ID addresses blockchain, which places the hash of the video 

file to the blockchain. 

4. User sends the video file to PROVER client (bank, insurance company, 

news media, etc.) to provide access to its services. 

5. PROVER client uses PROVER platform (frontend) or our open source 

algorithms directly to confirm the authenticity of the recording and 

to hash the received video file to confirm the hash was properly 

placed on the blockchain. 



 

 

4.2. Verification using sensors 

A stream of metadata (data from all sensors available in mobile device, 

with the maximum frequency - an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, 

GPS coordinates, etc) will be recorded in parallel with the video file to 

prevent forgery. Later there will be developed a mathematical algorithm 

that could allow restoring this information in the most precise details of 

the movements of the mobile device in the hands of the user to compare 

these movements with the video. 

 

Here we will describe the mathematical model of positioning in space based 

on a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis magnetometer under 

conditions of displacements with insignificant accelerations. 

 

To determine the position of the object in space, we introduce the global 

three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system 𝑂𝑋𝑌𝑍, so that the axis 𝑂𝑍, 

coincided in direction with the direction of gravity field power lines 𝑔
→
, 

and the axis 𝑂𝑌, coincided with the declination of the vector of the 

magnetic field of the planet ℎ
→

. 

 



 

To describe the position of the sensor in the global coordinate system 

(GCS) we introduce a local coordinate system (LCS), whose axes will 

coincide with the corresponding axes of the acceleration sensors and the 

magnetic field. Then the position of the LCS (sensors) in the GSC can be 

described by four vectors: 

𝑟𝐿𝐶𝑆
→
 – the displacement vector of the origin of the LCS relative to the GCS 

origin; 

𝑖𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

, 𝑗𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

, 𝑘𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

 – directing vectors of the orthonormal basis of LCS expressed 

in terms of the directing vectors of the orthonormal GCS basis. 

  

Such description gives complete information about the orientation of the 

LCS in the GCS in coordinate form. The problem of determining the angular 

orientation reduces to finding the coordinates of the vectors 𝑖𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

, 𝑗𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

, 𝑘𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

 

in GCS. 

 

Due to the fact that the gravitational field is more stable than the 

magnetic field, let us take the acceleration sensor as a basis. The 

acceleration sensor readings are the coordinates of the acceleration vector 

of the free fall, decomposed along the axes of the LCS: 

𝑎𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑎𝑥 , 𝑎𝑦 , 𝑎𝑧} 

 

The normalized vector 𝑎𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

 is nothing else but a vector 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

, i.e., the 

defining vector of the OZ GSK axis, expressed in terms of the directing 

vectors of the LCS: 

𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

=
𝑎𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

|𝑎𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

|
= {𝑘𝑥, 𝑘𝑦 , 𝑘𝑧} 

 

The readings of the magnetic field sensor are the coordinates of the 

magnetic field vector, decomposed along the LCS axes: 

𝑚𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑚𝑥, 𝑚𝑦 , 𝑚𝑧} 

 

Vector 𝑚𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

 in the general case may not be parallel to the vector 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

, 

therefore, it needs to get its normal component: 

𝑛𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= 𝑚𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

− (𝑚𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

⋅ 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

) ⋅ 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

 

 



 

The normalized vector 𝑛𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

 is nothing else but a vector 𝑗𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

, i.e. The 

defining axis vector 𝑂𝑌GCS, expressed through the directing vectors of the 

LCS: 

𝑗𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

=
𝑛𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

|𝑛𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

|
= {𝑗𝑥 , 𝑗𝑦 , 𝑗𝑧} 

 

The defining axis vector 𝑂𝑋 GCS, expressed through the directing vectors 

of the LCS, is found using the vector product: 

𝑖𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

= 𝑗𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

× 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑖𝑥 , 𝑖𝑦 , 𝑖𝑧} 

 

We compose the matrix of the row represented by the vectors 𝑖𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

,  𝑗𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

, 𝑘𝐺𝐶𝑆
→

, 

then transpose it and expand it into vectors (also in rows): 

|𝑖𝑥𝑖𝑦𝑖𝑧𝑗𝑥𝑗𝑦𝑗𝑧𝑘𝑥𝑘𝑦𝑘𝑧|
𝑇 = |𝑖𝑥𝑗𝑥𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑦𝑗𝑦𝑘𝑦𝑖𝑧𝑗𝑧𝑘𝑧| 

 

Thus, the vectors: 

𝑖𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑖𝑥 , 𝑗𝑥 , 𝑘𝑥} 

𝑗𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑖𝑦 , 𝑗𝑦 , 𝑘𝑦} 

𝑘𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑖𝑧 , 𝑗𝑧 , 𝑘𝑧} 

determining the axis of the LCS in the GCS, in other words, determine the 

orientation of the LCS in the GCS. 

 

Let's express the vector 𝑎𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

  in GCS: 

𝑎
→
= 𝑎𝑥 ⋅ 𝑖𝐿𝐶𝑆

→

+ 𝑎𝑦 ⋅ 𝑗𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

+ 𝑎𝑧 ⋅ 𝑘𝐿𝐶𝑆
→

= {𝑎′𝑥 , 𝑎′𝑦 , 𝑎′𝑧} 

 

Vector readings 𝑎
→
 given in the quanta of the ADC of the acceleration 

sensor, for further calculations we translate them into the International 

System of Quantities (ISQ) and write the instantaneous acceleration vector: 

𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠
→

=
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒

𝑁
⋅ 𝑎
→
,  

where the “range” is the range of the analog-to-digital sensor converter, 

and N is the division price. 

 

To take into account the gravitational field, it is necessary to reduce the 

vertical component by the value of the acceleration of gravity: 

𝑎𝑔
→
= 𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠

→
− {0,0, −𝑔} 

 

Let's move from acceleration to speed: 



 

𝑣𝑔
→
= ∫ 𝑎𝑔

→
𝑑𝑡 + 𝑣0

→
≈ ∑𝑎𝑔

→
𝛥𝑇 + 𝑣0

→
 

 

Let's move from speed to coordinates: 

𝑟𝑔
→
= ∫ 𝑣𝑔

→
𝑑𝑡 + 𝑟0

→
≈ ∑𝑟𝑔

→
𝛥𝑇 + 𝑟0

→
 

 

Thus, the proposed mathematical model makes it possible to determine the 

orientation of the sensor relative to the global coordinate system 

associated with the physical features of the planet from sensor readings, 

to determine the linear movement of the sensor by linear integration in the 

global coordinate system, and consequently, from the recorded measurement 

sequence, to reconstruct the trajectory of the movement of the user's 

personal mobile device. 

4.3. Clapperboard (Prover Clapperboard application) 

If the filming is not making on the camera of a smartphone with connection 

to Internet, it can not be verified with SWYPE ID technology. For example, 

SWYPE ID does not fit for action cameras, fixed video surveillance cameras, 

video recorders in cars, cameras in drones, digital cameras for journalism, 

blogging and video clips and many other cases. For these purposes we 

develop Prover Clapperboard technology. 

 



 

Verification of the video, in this case, is based on the algorithm of 

automatic detection of a special QR code inside the video stream. To do 

this, using our application for a smartphone or tablet, user needs to 

request the generation of QR code that contains the current number of the 

block in blockchain (as a timestamp) and other information about the video 

that the user wants to save in the blockchain (for example, the title of 

the video, the location, frame or scene number, etc).  How it works: 

1. User launches the app and inputs the text information which he wants 

to be saved in blockchain and to be associated with video. 

2. Then user sends entered text to the blockchain and gets the hash of 

the transaction and block, which contains this text in blockchain. The 

hash of the transaction and block displays as QR code. 

 

3. QR code appears on the screen of an app and user can capture it while 

filming the video by any kind of digital cameras. 



 

 

4. User can check the video file with that QR code by uploading it using 

frontend or our open source algorithms directly. Video analytics finds 

and recognizes QR-code, searches for a block in the blockchain, then 

retrieves the stored information and detects the block time. If found,  

the video is confirmed. 

4.4.  Prover Certificates  

If system confirms file as truthful - it generates the certificate, which 

can be used as a key to access the actual blocks containing this 

information (hash, dates, etc). 

This certificate can be saved in PDF format and printed. It contains the 

filename, date and time of recording and QR codes with the link to actual 

block of the swype code block for the application of the SWIPE ID and QR 

code for the Clapperboard application and the link to a block containing 

the hash of the file. These codes can be scanned and verify the 

authenticity of the file. We believe that after studying the technology 

these certificates will be in demand by business companies and by 

governments of different countries. 



 

 

  

5. How it works 

5.1. General SWYPE ID algorithm 

The user installs the mobile app PROVER on the smartphone, grants it access 

rights to the camera, which allowed the app to start camera automatically. 

 

When the camera is turned on, the user's smartphone accesses the blockchain 

via the Internet to obtain a swype code as a verification task that the 

user must perform while recording video data. Entering the swype code is 

carried out by moving the smartphone with the video recording mode turned 

on in the space of virtual points 3 by 3 points by the randomly generated 

trajectory (in blockchain or on the basis of data from the blockchain). 

 

The user performs a video recording using the camera of the smartphone and 

at any time of the recording performs "input" of the swype code. When 

entering the swype code, the user can see hints in the form of virtual dots 

3 to 3 and his detected movement of the smartphone. For additional 

confirmation of reliability, synchronous video recording of a sequence of 

measurements from smartphone sensors (an accelerometer and a magnetometer). 



 

 

After the video is completed, the hash of the video file is calculated. The 

resulting hash is stored in the blockchain. 

  

Recorded video is stored by the user on a personal device or cloud disk and 

can be presented for authentication if necessary. 

 

Thus, in blockchain in one form or another, the following information is 

available: 

● Date and time of receipt of the individual swype code; 

● The generated swype code; 

● A hash of a video data file (the video data file itself is stored by 

the user); 

● Date and time of hash loading. 

 

To verify the authenticity of the needed video file, a file hash 

calculationthat retrieves the stored information from the blockchain is 

performed;, if the information  is not there, it notifies that the hash has 

not been uploaded. On the basis of the received information, it is 

concluded that the file with this hash was created not earlier than the 

time of receiving the individual swype code and not later than the time of 

loading the hash in the blockchain. 

 

The user's video file is visually reviewed for continuity to exclude video 

editing and confirm the presence of the swype code, issued to the user as a 

verification task, on the video. After completing the first stage of the 

PROVER project, the presence of the swype code on the video will be 

determined by the automatic algorithm. After the second stage of the PROVER 

project the continuity of the video recording will be determined by the 

automatic algorithm. If existing continuous video record  contains the same 

code as generated swype code from the blockchain, there is a reason to make 

the conclusion that the record was made by the user not earlier than when 

the swype code was issued. Herewith the moment when the swype code is 

issued is fixed in the blockchain and is unavailable for modification by 

the user. 

 

After completing the third stage of the PROVER project an algorithm of 

reconstruction the path of the personal mobile device in the user's hands 

during video recording will be made available and the reconstructed 

trajectory can be compared to the recorded video data. If the video 



 

recording and the restored trajectory of the personal mobile device 

coincide, one prompts the conclusion that it is unambiguously confirmed 

that the recording was made from a real camera embedded in a personal 

mobile device, and is not emulated. 

5.2. Implementation for Ethereum 

The implementation for the Ethereum platform is carried out on the basis of 

the PROOF smart contract. The mobile application of the user accesses via 

the Internet to the PROOF smart contract to obtain the swype code. PROOF 

smart contract captures the issued one-time swype code and the time it was 

issued. 

  

After the video is completed, the hash of the video file is calculated. The 

received hash is sent to the PROOF smartсontract, where it is stored. 

  

The PROOF smart сontract saves the following information: 

● Date and time of the individual swype code issue; 

● The issued swype code; 

● A hash of a video data file (the video data file itself is stored by 

the user); 

● Date and time of hash uploading. 

 

To verify the authenticity of user's video file calculates its hash, which 

is sent to the PROOF smart contract. In response, the PROOF smart contract 

returns the information stored for that hash or notifies the user that such 

hash has not been loaded. On the basis of the received information, it can 

be concluded that the file with this hash was created not earlier than the 

time of receiving the individual swype code and not later than the time of 

loading the hash into the smart contract. 

5.3. Implementation for NEM 

To verify the authenticity of user's video file,  its hash, which retrieves 

the stored information from the NEM blockchain, is calculated. On the basis 

of the received information, it can be concluded that the file with this 

hash was created not earlier than the time of adding to the blockchain of 

the block based on the hash from which the swype code was generated and not 

later than the download time of the hash of the video file in the 

blockchain. 

Why NEM: 



 

1. NEM’s Smart Asset System allows us to define and launch token PROOF. 

PROOF Tokens owners have the right to access PROVER and to obtain 

services that will be provided by PROVER. 

2. NEM blocks complete every 60 seconds. This is important for the 

PROVER. We must store the information about the swype code creation 

in the blockchain, and the time of the user's result waiting depends 

on the transaction confirmation time. 

3. We are going to create our own Namespace. It lets us create a unique 

place for our project data on the NEM blockchain. This makes our 

assets unique, easy to use, and more trustworty. 

4. We will use Messages to store information in NEM blockchain. 

5. Transaction fees are kept low. For each video confirmation we need 

two transactions - one for creating and saving the swype code, and 

the other for storing the hash of the recorded video file. 

 

6. USE CASES 

The PROVER service makes it possible to apply a mechanism that confirms the 

fact of a certain statement and allows you to unambiguously associate the 

fact of this statement with a certain person and exact time coordinates. 

 

PROVER technology can be used independently, but it takes on special value 

because it can be used as a basis for a large number of applications and 

services from a wide range of areas. 

6.1. Fintech 

In the field of fintech the PROVER project is a tool designed to perform 

legally meaningful actions in the absence of any infrastructure except the 

mobile Internet. One of the most striking examples of the place of such 

technology is the spread of various banking products (including 

microcredits in the countries of Central and South Africa, India, Southeast 

Asia, Latin America) The mentioned regions number 3.5 billion people, which 

are not covered by the infrastructure of the international banking 

community, 3.5 billion potential customers. 

 

At the same time, the income of the borrower's family is estimated  no less 

than 1’000 $ a year. Assuming a number of expected earnings from one family 

(6 people) at 10 $ per year, with an average annual rate of 22%, a 

preliminary estimation of the credit market corresponds to $ 5 billion per 



 

year. At the same time, as a rule, the traditional way of life of the 

described part of the population seems to be living in a rural community 

and a similar social association, which substantially alleviates the risks 

of non-repayment of a loan (according to statistics, 3%). 

 

At the same time, in the presence of a solvent demand for credit, the 

further development of the provision of credit products in these regions is 

balking on the inability to relate the identity of the borrower to the fact 

of his will to take a loan. In connection with the lack of technological 

ability to prevent the forgery of this statement. Neither banks nor the 

state simply lacks staff on the ground that could confirm the identity of 

the borrower and his will. 

 

The PROVER service and biometric identification systems provide a 

technological opportunity to overcome this situation by simultaneously 

using traditional smartphone technologies (video fixing capabilities), 

editing and file editing technology and blockchain technology (an 

unequivocally interpreted timestamp and an unchangeable hash of the file). 

 

Let's imagine a traditional rural African family in Sub-Sahara region. 

Husband, wife and their 3-5 children. They work in the field daily, eat 

from their kitchen garden, and they have an income once or twice a year 

after they sell their crops. To earn about 500$ per employee or 1’000$ per 

family. Wife has a dream to buy a sewing machine and start tailoring 

clothes for fellow villagers. And the whole village dreams of a 

purification plant for obtaining drinking water from a nearby river. 

 

Wife, having a cheap Chinese smartphone, found out in WhatsApp from her 

friends  the possibility of obtaining a loan from a European bank under the 

guarantee of fellow villagers. She went to the site, downloaded the mobile 

application and opened it, wrote down her video application for a loan. 

Four of her friends and the head of the village acted as guarantors for her 

application, also reading the text while recording on her smartphone. All 

records were confirmed by the PROVER service. The security service of the 

bank, using the open-source software PROVER, checked the absence of video 

editing and falsification. After that, a verdict  on the approval of the 

loan was reached. 

 

Funds arrives at her account and she can either spend them in an online 

store (by entering virtual credit card details) or pay for services inside 



 

the village by online transfer from her online account to the account of 

the contractor. She buys a sewing machine, cloth, thread, accessories and 

starts her micro-business to tailor for her fellow villagers. The business 

is going up, she gradually accumulates and extinguishes the loan. She pays 

the bills as well as she used to pay for the Internet - buying prepaid 

cards in a village store. Having repaid the loan, she continues to work for 

herself, her income grows, she buys new fabrics and goods for sewing. 

Spends money on other village goods and services - in the village there are 

businesses, the welfare of families is growing, their consumption is 

growing. The economy of the countryside, the country, the region is 

growing. The number of transactions between newly established businesses is 

increasing. Verification of video agreements and transactions between 

participants is performed by the PROVER service. This is a condition of the 

bank to ensure the security of transactions and guarantee the targeted use 

of funds. 

 

Investment money revives the economy of African villages, the region's GDP 

grows. The income of banks is growing. Prover revenue increases, the need 

and cost of PROOF tokens is also increased. 

6.2. Auto Insurance 

Over $80 bln is being lost each year by insurance companies in the US 

because of fraud. PROVER platform and swype ID can be used to create a 

valuable security addition for  a car on demand. The client carries out the 

video recording of the condition of his car for the conclusion of an 

insurance contract with the purpose of providing this video, certified by 

the PROVER system, as evidence in a case of an insured event.  

In a case of an insured event, the user presents the recorded video data to 

the insurance company to verify their authenticity. 

 

The application solution for the insurance company will include the 

following components: 

 

● The platform server (service provider) is a non-visual service that 

receives requests from the Mobile applications of clients, transmits 

them to the Server of the insurance company, and places information 

in the blockchain. 

● The insurance company's server is a service of an insurance company 

that directly rates the insurance services provided to the user. In 

fact, the server of the insurance company believes how much money is 

http://www.insurancefraud.org/statistics.htm#1


 

left for the client. For data verification the insurance company's 

server can access the platform server and directly access the 

blockchain. 

● Mobile application is for managing the status of customers, allowing 

to enable or to disable the insurance and specify the volume of 

provided services. The mobile application interacts only with the 

Platform Server; thisguarantees the client  the preservation of the 

data in blockchain. The access code to the service can be the 

insurance policy number, which is bought by the client directly at 

the Insurance company. When the insurance is activated the user must 

record all sides of the vehicle on the video. A user's video file is 

stored on his smartphone, tablet or on a personal cloud drive such as 

Google Drive or Dropbox, a hash is sent to the Platform Server, which 

is hosted in the blockchain. In a case of an insured event, the user 

sends a video file to the Insurance Company, and the Insurance 

company verifies its authenticity by hash and the time of recording 

through the blockchain. 

 
This approach allows excluding fraud with insurance when a client in 

collusion with an employee of an insurance company or a law enforcement 

officer сonclude an insurance contract of a pre-damaged car or claims 

compensation of fake insurance event. On a global scale, it will allow 

insurance companies to save billions of dollars annually. 

 

The essential point for that application is confirmation unambiguous or 

with a high degree of reliability, that the provided video data has been 

recorded by the client not earlier or not later that known points fixed in 

time  (insured event). And the recording was made by the user with a real 

camera of a personal mobile device (smartphone, tablet, a personal 

computer, a laptop). This will  prevent the possibility to apply the video 

data that were recorded before the insured event happened. 

 

The innovative product will be a server platform and a mobile application 

that allows to enable and disable insurance and lasting of the insurance 

period, enter the amount of requested services (insurance options). This 

will allow, for example, not to insure the car from theft when the driver 

is behind the wheel, or even to disable insurance when the car is parked in 

the garage. In this case, the installation of additional devices in the car 

is not required. 

 



 

Competitive advantages of the created product are: 

● The opportunity to reduce the price of insurance through the flexible 

management of insurance during the entire period of the contract, 

thereby attracting car owners of different levels of prosperity, 

including  those who did not use this insurance product in general 

because of its high cost; 

● No need to install additional devices on the car; 

● The opportunity for the owner of the insurance to easily and quickly 

prove the occurrence of the insured event by sending video materials 

to the Insurance Company, while confirming the authenticity of the 

presented video is carried out using PROVER technology; 

● The possibility of providing a trusted interaction between the client 

and the insurance company using a distributed registry based on 

blockchain that stores all insurance options management transactions 

where the guarantor of the safety of the actions performed by the 

client is not the insurance company but millions of users of the 

blockchain network around the world. 

6.3. Video Proof of Ownership 

The user, while recording video (using a smartphone or tablet camera), can 

also register his authorship and be able to confirm it. This can be 

interesting for mobile reporters, freelance correspondents (stringers), 

bloggers, extreme sportsmen, travelers, musicians, composers and other 

people engaged in creative work, as well as ordinary users of social 

networks and video services. They can use both of our products as SWIPE ID 

for smartphones and Clapperboard for recording from digital and action 

cameras. 

 

6.4. Public Statements 

Public speakers, celebrities and businessmen will use PROVER to prevent 

themselves from reputational damage from montage, CGI and rapidly growing 

sophisticated machine learning algorithms and tools able to edit or 

generate fake video statements. 

6.5. Crowdsourced Media Platforms 

Public and crowdsourced news and content platforms can validate the 

authenticity, exclusivity and timing of video news submitted by individual 

contributors. Both users and platforms can prove the authenticity and 



 

exclusivity of user generated video content and share monetization 

proceeds. They can use both of our products as SWIPE ID for smartphones and 

Clapperboard for recording from digital and action cameras. 

6.6. Video Platforms with User-generated Content 

Public and crowdsourced news platforms can validate the authenticity, 

exclusivity and timing of video news submitted by individual contributors. 

6.7. Online Dating 

Online dating services are often characterized by high share of fake and 

accounts that can possibly lead to increasing fraud levels. By utilizing 

Prover solution users can be sure that they are chatting with a real person 

on various dating apps. 

6.8. Outsourced Work Reports 

With PROVER technology it will be easy to carry out a remote inspection of 

the works (construction, installation, cleaning, patrolling, courier 

delivery,  merchandising, placing outdoor advertising, etc.). Video 

impartially captures the process and fact of the work done, and the PROVER 

service objectively assures the date and time of video recording. Drones 

with cameras can use PROVER Clapperboard app for video filming and remote 

inspections of construction sites, agricultural fields, forests, etc.  

6.9. Traffic Accident Reports 

Both parties involved in a traffic accident can rely on a video recording 

of the crash itself or damages to prove authenticity of time, date and 

record of the accident. 

6.10. Notary Actions 

PROVER technology makes possible to protect and verify video messages of a 

legal nature without a necessity to visit any officials. Remote video 

statement used for a transaction, giving evidence, explanation, report, 

interview, etc., will become objective and legitimate evidence. The system 

confirms the date and the place on the video, the notify body compares the 

video with the photo or video could be available in the database and 

confirms that it is the same person. For example, remote reception of 

citizens. Municipal and corporate officials can work in this way, 

considering the recorded appeals and statements of citizens/clients. 



 

6.11. Home Education / Exams 

For educational projects PROVER technology can perform the function of 

remote identification of users and verification of their actions within the 

educational platform. To date, there has gained popularity of the platforms 

in the world for Mass Open Online Courses (MOOCs), for example, Coursera, 

Udemy, Udacity, edX and others. Vulnerable part of these services is the 

impossibility of 100% confirmation of the learner's personality and 

verification of the received knowledge. At the moment, on the Coursera 

platform, it is required to do selfies, but this approach is absolutely not 

protected from forgery. It is possible to integrate PROVER technology into 

the distance learning applications and create video recordings of the exams 

by the user, to make sure that the exam is really passed by the person on 

the video, and that he did not use cheat sheets, did not left the room, 

etc. This approach will allow to issue personal certificates with a photo 

and be sure that the person pictured in the photo on the certificate is the 

person who passed the exams. The video of exams can also be stored for 

further confirmation. 

7. Team 

The project team has experience for more than ten years of teamwork. We 

implemented a number of large-scale projects in the field of intelligent 

video surveillance systems, hardware products, and IT services for 

healthcare in 74 countries. At the moment, the project team follows to the 

principles of openness and decentralization and invests resources in the 

development of advanced technologies associated with the blockchain. We 

know how to make high-quality and popular products, and we believe that we 

can benefit from the whole blockchain community by making the PROVER 

project our contribution to crypto-economics.

8. Project roadmap 

 



 

 



 

9. Guide to purchase 

To finance the development and ensure the functioning of the PROVER system, 

a fund-raising phase, known as crowdsale, will be conducted. The crowdsale 

will be conducted in the ecosystem of the Etherium. During the crowdsale, 

people could purchase tokens PROOF by a fixed rate, which are a certificate 

for the right to receive services of the PROVER. At the technological layer 

application services (for example, auto insurance services) use the PROVER 

capabilities, paying off the PROOF pre-received tokens, and mutual 

settlements with their users are conducted in any currency, for example, in 

their tokens or fiat money. 

9.1. Pre-ICO 

The PROOF smart contract issues the emission of tokens PROOF, the number of 

which during the Pre-ICO the maximum collected amount is limited to 

500'000$, upon reaching which the release of tokens ceases. Tokens are sold 

at a price fixed in US dollars, 125 PROOF = 1$, i.е. the investor in the 

Pre-ICO stage has a 25% bonus, compared to the subsequent crowdsale. 

 

At a one-time purchase of tokens in the amount of 50'000$ or more a special 

price of 150 PROOF = 1% is valid. 

 

The purchase is carried out by transferring the ether to the address of the 

smart contract, and the sender of the transaction automatically becomes the 

owner of the purchased tokens. Be careful and remember that you should not 

pay from incompatible with ERC20 contracts wallets or from an account on a 

crypto exchange – this can lead to loss of control over the tokens you have 

purchased. The exchange rate of the ether to the US dollar is fixed at the 

time of the launch of the Pre-ICO and remains unchanged during the whole 

period of its holding. The duration of the Pre-ICO is 30 days from launch. 

 

The condition for the success of Pre-ICO is to collect a minimum of 300'000 

$, otherwise all collected sum returned to customers, minus commissions for 

transactions and gas prices. 

 

All summ collected for Pre-ICO are transferred to the PROVER team and 

should be spent on the following works: 

● Development of a prototype of a mobile application for Android, which 

provides interaction with the PROOF smart contract; 

● Marketing and project promotion, preparation for crowdsale. 



 

9.2. Crowdsale 

The PROOF smart contract carries out the emission of PROOF tokens, the 

amount of which during crowdsale is not limited. Our goal is 5 000 000$, 

but we do not limit the collection, because it will make our project 

better. Tokens are sold at a price fixed in US dollars, 100 PROOF = 1$. The 

purchase is carried out by transferring the ether to the address of the 

smart contract, and the sender of the transaction becomes the owner of the 

purchased tokens. Be careful and remember that you should not pay from an 

online wallet or from an account on a crypto exchange, which can lead to 

loss of control over the tokens you have purchased. The exchange rate of 

ether to the US dollar is set up by our team and can be changed during the 

crowdsale. 

 

For early birds there is a system of discounts: 

● 115 PROOF = 1$ during of the first day of crowdsale; 

● 110 PROOF = 1$ during of the first week of crowdsale. 

 

For large investors: 

● 120 PROOF = 1$ One-time purchase of more than 50 000$ 

 

For Cryptaur project CPT tokens holders: 

● 150 PROOF = 100 CPT 

 

After the end of crowdsale, a one-time additional emission is carried out, 

during which 50% of the total issue of tokens are issued, 28% of which 

remain with the project team, 10% are for project advisors, 10% are for 

Partners (Business Developers), 2% are reserved for bounty. The crowdsale 

starts on  30.01.2018 and ends on  31.03.2018. 

9.3. Additional tokens emission 

Additional emission of PROOF tokens is allowed. The decision to conduct an 

additional emission take by voting the key owners of the tokens. The 

decision is made by a simple majority of votes. 

9.4. Synergy of PROOF and HMQ tokens 

Humaniq and PROVER projects expand the ecosystems of each other. So for 

PROVER, the Humaniq project is an application solution. The mutual 

settlements between Humaniq and PROVER are carried out in PROOF tokens, 

while Humaniq works with its clients in its own HMQ tokens. 

http://cryptaur.com/


 

  

Thus, the increase in the cost of PROOF tokens is provided due to the fact 

that the Humaniq project extends the PROVER ecosystem, creating an 

additional demand for PROOF tokens on the market with one time fixed 

emission. 

  

The increase in the cost of HMQ tokens is ensured by the fact that the 

PROVER project extends the functionality of the Humaniq system, providing 

additional value to Humaniq for customers, which is additionally provided 

in the framework of the permanent emission of HMQ tokens. 

10. Conclusion 

The first phones with video cameras appeared around 2002, and the era of 

smartphones officially started with the advent of the iPhone came only 10 

years ago. Until 2005 there was no YouTube service in the world! The first 

version of Bitcoin code originated in 2008, and the first wallet of Satoshi 

Nakamoto was created in early 2009. Can you imagine your life today without 

them? 

 

The number of smartphones users in the world is about 4 billion people, and 

by 2020 there will be more than 6 billion. And all these people will  

instantly communicate in messengers, post content, including video content 

in various of social networks. 

 

All of them will be involved in new economy, they will acquire goods and 

services online, using their smart devices, using cryptocurrency. Most of 

the today's offline services will be transmitted online and scaled to 

billions of users around the world. This process is seriously hampered now 

only by the fear of fraud and security requirements. 

 

Our technology can put a reliable barrier in the way of scammers and open 

widely the doors to online and crypto-economy for whole branches of banking 

and insurance, legal and other conservative spheres. 

 

It should also note the global benefits of our project for the development 

of the blockchain community. Our system could be a driver for the 

popularization of blockchain technology and crypto-currency among the  

population of our planet. It will bring millions of new users from all over 



 

the world to blockchain economy, increasing the overall volume and 

popularity of the blockchain economy!
