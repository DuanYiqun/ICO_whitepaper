01  WHAT ARE CRYPTOCURRENCIES?
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



05BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

What Are Cryptocurrencies? 

 Welcome to BetKing’s Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies. 
Here, we’re taking you through a broad list of all of the different cryp-
tocurrencies, alt coins and tokens on offer here at our Bitcoin Casino, 
and with so many to choose from, your options for withdrawals and 
deposits are almost endless. But before we get started, what exactly 
are cryptocurrencies, and where did they come from? Whether you’re 
an experienced cryptocasino bettor, or you’re a beginner to this excit-
ing new technology, the story behind cryptocurrencies is an interesting 
one. Read on to find out more, or skip to our other pages to find out 
more about your cryptocurrency of choice!

Where Did Cryptocurrencies Originate?

While many people may know of cryptocurrencies, especially with the 
broad number of financial institutions who are beginning to implement 
some form of research, publish a paper or introduce a blockchain tech-
nology side-project, few people actually know where cryptocurrencies 
originated from. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency emerged as a side 
product to another invention. Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor/group 
of inventors (no-one is quite sure), of Bitcoin, didn’t intend to develop 
the Bitcoin currency he created. Initially, Satoshi developed what he 
determined was a ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’, and this was 
announced back in late 2008. 

There are a number of features which Satoshi Nakamoto introduced to 
the world as  a result of Bitcoin’s creation and these include:

• A completely decentralised, peer-to-peer payment network
• A network which has no server or central authority
• The ability to prevent double-spending
• A trustworthy network which would be more reliable than the pre-

vious failed Trusted Third Party based systems such as Digicash. 

This major innovation was something that many did not think was pos-
sible, as Satoshi managed to develop a payment network, without a 
single central entity to record every transaction, yet still ensured abso-
lute consensus.

This transaction between both 
parties is displayed as a ‘block’ 
within the network

Once validated, the block is then 
added to the chain, helping to 
provide a transparent log of all 
transactions

This block will then be broadcast 
to every party involved with the 
network

Once all of this has occurred, 
Person B will receive the funds 
sent from Person A 

Person A wants to send 
funds to Person B

It is their job to then validate 
and approve the transaction 
within the network

What Are Cryptocurrencies? 

So What Are Cryptocurrencies Exactly?

With a lot of spiel regarding the Blockchain technology behind crypto-
currencies and the numerous advantages and disadvantages, the true 
definition of a cryptocurrency can sometimes be blurred. However, if 
you take this all away, the simple definition is that cryptocurrencies 
are limited entries within a database, which no-one can alter or amend 
without fulfilling a specific condition. Interestingly, this is the exact 
same definition as a regular currency - and the only difference with 
the crypto version is that it is completely decentralised as opposed to 
being ruled by a centralised authority such as a government or a bank. 

How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?

This is where things become a little more complicated, however if you 
begin to understand this, then you’re likely to know more about cryp-
tocurrencies than the majority of the human population. While each 
cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin all have their 
own different properties, the process of obtaining them and how they 
actually work as part of the blockchain technology is identical. 

Firstly, someone will request a transaction, and this transaction is 
broadcast to the peer-to-peer network which consists of what is known 
as nodes. At this stage, the transaction must be validated, and it is the 
job of this network of notes to validate the transaction and the user’s 
status using specific algorithms. At this point, the validation can re-

fer to a cryptocurrency, or for other P2P networks, the nodes may be 
used to verify a contract, record or other form of information. Once the 
transaction is verified, it will then be combined with other transactions 
in order to develop a block of data for the ledger. This block of data is 
then added to the existing blockchain and once this occurs, the data is 
permanent and completely unalterable. As soon as the block of data 
is added to the blockchain, the transaction is then complete. Once the 
transaction is confirmed (which can only be achieved through miners), 
it cannot be reversed, forged, or altered in any way. It is on this block-
chain that the records of each and every transaction is recorded, so 
while there is no centralised party taking record, the technology itself 
is, which is what helps to ensure no double-payments are carried out. 

What Are Miners & What Do They Do?

In the excerpt above we mention about miners being able to confirm 
the transaction, but what exactly are miners, and what do they do? Es-
sentially, it doesn’t take a special qualification or skill to become a min-
er, and with cryptocurrencies being a decentralised network, there is 
no authority to be able to delegate the task of mining to a certain set of 
individuals. As a result of the decentralisation of cryptocurrencies, it is 
imperative that some kind of mechanism is in play in order to ensure 
that there is not a singular ruling party out to abuse the P2P network. 
This is where Satoshi’s mining rule comes in.

In order to mine cryptocurrencies, miners must find a hash, a type of 

01



08BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

What Are Cryptocurrencies? 

cryptographic function, which helps any new block to connect with a 
predecessor block (which is part of the verification process). This is 
known as the Proof-of-Work. In order to find this hash, depending on 
each individual cryptocurrency, miners must solve a cryptologic puz-
zle, which will then, once solved, allow them to build a block and add it 
to the existing blockchain. 

Sounds confusing, right? Fortunately, in order to play at BetKing, you 
don’t have to worry about mining your own Bitcoins, Litecoins or any of 
the other altcoins, cryptocurrencies and tokens on offer. All you have to 
do is deposit your funds and start playing. 

Properties Of Cryptocurrencies

So, we’ve covered the background of cryptocurrencies (which is most 
closely related to Bitcoin, but each of our dedicated pages within this 
eBook will dive into how each cryptocurrency is developed), what they 
actually are, and how transactions occur. We’ve even taken you through 
a brief introduction to Bitcoin mining - but we’re not done yet. 

There are a number of exciting transactional and monetary properties 
which is helping to push the popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocur-
rencies even further. 

Transactional Properties

Irreversible - Due to the decentralised nature of the network, once 
you send your transaction, it is sent. You cannot claim it back, or re-
verse the transaction, and you also cannot alter the transaction once 
it has been verified. This means that if a hacker stole the cryptocur-
rencies from your computer, then you would not be able to claim them 
back. This is the case for all cryptocurrencies, which is why it is excep-
tionally important to choose a secure storage wallet in order to protect 
your funds. 

Pseudonymous - While many people believe that cryptocurrencies 
offer an anonymous transactional experience, this isn’t exactly true. 
While transactions and accounts are not connected to any real-life 
identity, it is more accurate to describe cryptocurrencies as pseudon-
ymous, as you will receive and deliver transactions using an ‘address’ 
(which is a flowing chain of up to around 30 characters). This means 
that the transaction flow can be analysed, but it is not necessarily pos-
sible to connect the transaction to a real identity.

What Are Cryptocurrencies? 

Global - Due to the fact the platform is not controlled by a single entity, 
cryptocurrencies are accessible around the world. While there are nu-
merous regulations being put in place, due to the global network of the 
transactions and the pseudonymity of the currency, you can access, re-
ceive and send cryptocurrencies regardless of your physical location. 

Secure - One of the major benefits of cryptocurrencies is the fact that 
they are locked up securely behind a cryptographic public and private 
key system. This means that only the owner of the cryptocurrency is 
able to access and send the cryptocurrencies in their wallet, and due to 
the cryptographic function of the security, it is more secure than some 
of the world’s highest security prisons! 

Monetary Properties 

There are two main monetary properties which is helping to boost the 
popularity of cryptocurrencies, in particular the ever-growing Bitcoin. 

Firstly, there is a controlled supply for the majority of tokens. Each cryp-
tocurrency will have a schedule written in the code to ensure that once 

the last one is mined, no more will be put into circulation. This means 
that the supply of each and every cryptocurrency can be calculated 
and determined, helping to maintain value and avoid circumstances 
such as inflation or deflation. 

In addition to this, cryptocurrencies do not represent debt. They are ex-
actly what they are, and once they’re yours, they remain yours - nobody 
can take them away or demand that you pay them back. 

What’s Next For Cryptocurrencies?

As you can see, there are a huge number of benefits to cryptocurren-
cies, and this is actually beginning to frighten large financial corpora-
tions. While banks, governments and corporate entities are beginning 
to cautiously embrace this technology, with it still being in its infancy, 
there are a number of uses still to be discovered for the blockchain 
technology. Cryptocurrencies offer a wealth of opportunities, and it is 
the security and speed of transactions that attracted us here at Bet-
King. As we begin to expand into a full Bitcoin Casino, there are a broad 
number of new avenues which we are looking to take with this exciting 
technology. Read on to find out more about the different cryptocurren-
cies, alt coins and tokens you can use when you play with BetKing, or

Bitcoin 

 Bitcoin is the world’s most popular and so far, the most estab-
lished cryptocurrency on the market. Despite having been developed 
almost by accident by founder(s) Satoshi Nakamoto, this particular 
cryptocurrency is set to revolutionise the financial markets around 
the globe. Here, we’re taking a closer look at Bitcoin, its history, how 
to store them and how you can use them to play our exciting games 
here at BetKing. 

History Of Bitcoin

There is a key reason as to why Bitcoin has been the main cryptocur-
rency to be impacted by the boom in popularity, and this is due to the 
fact that Bitcoin was actually the first cryptocurrency to be developed 
and made available for public use. This digital asset is secured with 
cryptography and then can be exchanged just like a currency, as with 
all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was the first fully-established and worka-
ble of them all, when Satoshi Nakamoto made the technology public 
in 2009. 

The first transaction took place between Satoshi Nakamoto and a 
trusted Bitcoin enthusiast, Hal Finney, in 2009 and it was in 2010 
when somebody decided to purchase two pizzas for the price of 
10,000 BTC. While that was the equivalent to very little back in 2010, 
since the Bitcoin bubble, the cost of those pizzas would be the equiva-
lent of more than $100 million! It was in 2011 when Nakamoto shared 
the Bitcoin source code and domains, and since then the creator(s) of 

Bitcoin has been undetectable. 

What Is Bitcoin?

Simply put, Bitcoin is a digital currency, which you can find more 
about in the chapter above, and uses a P2P network to encompass 
transactions between buyers and sellers. It is through the use of 
blockchain technology which makes up this particular cryptocurrency, 
as well as the encryption keys (both public and private) which help to 
make a successful and secure transaction. As mentioned previously 
in the ‘What Are Cryptocurrencies?’ chapter, Bitcoin also has to be 
‘mined’ - just like diamonds or gold.

How To Store Bitcoin

Storing Bitcoin can be carried out in a number of different ways, and 
it is important that you have a ‘wallet’ prior to purchasing Bitcoin. 
Essentially, rather than actually holding the Bitcoin itself as if it were a 
real currency, the wallet will hold the private key which will allow you 
to access your Bitcoin address in order to carry out a transaction. It 
is important that the software you choose for your wallet is as secure 
as possible, in order to ensure that hackers are deterred. Some of the 
wallet types include:

Electronic Wallets - These particular types of wallets can be down-
loaded onto your computer/mobile/tablet, or alternatively may be 
hosted in the cloud. In a downloadable wallet, you are able to facilitate 
transactions using the Bitcoin you have stored there. In the hosted 
wallet however, you are essentially trusting a third party with the secu-
rity of your private keys. 

Software Wallets - This wallet type can be installed directly onto 
your computer, which can allow you to secure your very own wallet 

using as much encryption as possible, without having to rely on third 
party security options. The majority of software wallets are actually 
free. However, one of the biggest drawbacks to software wallets is 
the fact that you may have to regularly backup your wallet for security 
purposes. If your wallet becomes corrupted, you are at risk of losing 
them all, as they cannot be restored. 

Online Wallets - These types of wallets offer increased conveni-
ence, as you are able to access them from almost any device of your 
choice, as long as you have the correct passwords and/or keys. Many 
online wallets will also have desktop and mobile apps, to help make 
them even more accessible, making it easier than ever to transfer 
your Bitcoin and make a transaction. However, due to the fact your 
private keys are saved in a cloud format, the disadvantages are simi-
lar to that of cloud-hosted electronic wallets in terms of the levels of 
security. 

Mobile Wallets - Mobile wallets are what they say on the tin - wal-
lets for your mobile. These are generally available in app format and 
designed for ease of use when using a smartphone. This type of 
wallet is especially useful if you are looking to pay for something in a 

02



13BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin 

shop using Bitcoin - which is becoming increasingly possible as more 
companies are integrating this form of payment system into their 
stores. The majority of online wallets, as mentioned above, will have 
some form of app to go with them.

Hardware Wallets - These are possibly the most secure of all 
wallets, in terms of being hacked into or corrupted, as the majority of 
the time they are offline unless you are making a transaction. Howev-
er, this can make them slightly more inconvenient, and they can still 
be stolen as they are a physical object (almost like a memory drive 
or hardware disk). Some larger Bitcoin investors actually store their 
hardware wallets in bank vaults, particularly if they fear their hardware 
wallet being stolen or lost. If your hardware wallet is misplaced, it is 
virtually impossible to retrieve them again (unless you find the original 
wallet).

Paper Wallets - If you’re unsure about any form of technology stor-
ing your Bitcoin, whether online based, cloud based, or hardware, then 
you may want to consider turning to a paper wallet. This is the sim-
plest form of all Bitcoin wallets, and are essentially pieces of paper 

which have the public and private keys written on them. While these 
are ideal for long-term storage, or if you’re looking to give someone 
a gift, they can be extremely easy to misplace. Nevertheless, if you’re 
concerned about hackers, then you can be certain that your Bitcoins 
are safe using paper wallets. 

Benefits Of Bitcoin

As with all cryptocurrencies, the security, pseudonymity and ease 
of transaction is helping to make Bitcoin exceptionally popular, and 
beneficial to both users and institutions. However, due to the fact that 
Bitcoin is possible the most established of all cryptocurrencies, this 
particular coin offers something a little extra that many other crypto-
currencies do not. 

02



14BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin 

Proven - The main benefit to Bitcoin is the fact that it is a proven 
technology, which most other cryptocurrencies are based off of. This 
leads to much higher levels of trust, and therefore increased populari-
ty around the globe. 

No Third Party Interruptions - Despite increasing regulations 
on Bitcoin in particular, there are still no third party interruptions due 
to the decentralised network on which Bitcoin is based. No financial 
intermediaries are able to place freezes on accounts, remove Bitcoin 
tokens from wallets, or involve themselves in any other way. While 
this is leading to a lot of disruption in the financial world, for Bitcoin 
users themselves, this is extremely promising. As a result of this, and 
the pseudonymity the currency offers, users from countries around 
the globe, whether restricted by jurisdiction or not, are able to carry 
out a transaction in a streamlined and simple manner, without fear of 
repercussion. 

Ease Of Use - As a result of the wallets being accessible via all 
different platforms, transactions are easy to carry out, and are glob-
al. The currency is completely accessible, and anyone with a basic 
knowledge of mining is able to do so. With the growth in popularity, it 
is highly likely that accessibility will improve even further. 

Risks Of Bitcoin

With every new technology and innovation, alongside the numerous 
benefits, there are a few risks to take into consideration. Here at Bet-
King, we pride ourselves on our responsible gambling procedures, and 
ensure that all of our players are as informed as possible regarding all 
aspects of our gaming experience. 

With Bitcoin, while being a proven technology when compared to 
some of the newer cryptocurrencies, alt coins and tokens on the mar-
ket, there are still some adverse features to consider. 

Firstly, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is a rival to govern-
ment currency, and as a result, there may be restrictions and regula-
tions put in place against the currency in the future. We have already 
seen some rules, such as the ruling in 2015 by the New York State 
Department of Financial Services which regulated all companies deal-
ing with the buy, sell transfer or storage of the cryptocurrency. This 
meant that any companies would have to record the identity of cus-
tomers, maintain capital reserves and have a compliance officer keep 
track of transactions. This was to remove the element of anonymity 
associated with the cryptocurrency. However, other countries have 
been far more welcoming to this new technology, so queries regard-
ing Bitcoin’s longevity, liquidity and universality may not be a concern 
for many. 

02



15BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin 

In addition to this, there is a security risk that many users may need 
to consider. Due to the currency being entirely digital, the technology 
is at risk from hackers, malware and glitches. While the blockchain 
technology itself offers an extremely high level of security, there have 
been instances where exchanges (such as Mt. Gox) has been hacked 
and a high number of cryptocurrencies have been taken. This is why it 
is important for cryptocurrencies to be stored in a secure wallet. 
For investors, there are a few other risks to consider too, including 

market risk (there has been a high level of fluctuation in the Bitcoin 
market over recent years with some huge drops and some even 
bigger booms), fraud risk, tax risk and insurance risk depending on 
jurisdiction. 

Despite the few risks that are associated with Bitcoin, as there are 
with any investment and innovative technology, the benefits appear to 
far outweigh the drawbacks.

Ethereum

 While Bitcoin is dominating the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum 
is not far behind. This decentralised system offers numerous different 
properties, advantages and disadvantages when compared to Bitcoin, 
and with its implementation across numerous businesses, Ethereum 
is only going to continue to grow. Here at BetKing, we’re embracing 
Ethereum alongside Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies which 
you will learn about further into this eBook. In this particular chapter 
however, we’re taking a closer look at Ethereum and exactly what it has 
to offer its users.
  

History Of Ethereum
 
In 2013, a whitepaper discussing the Ethereum concept was developed 
by Vitalik Buterin, and as this was gradually picked up by numerous 
friends and acquaintances, the interest in this concept progressed. Af-
ter some tweaks to the concept, it was publicly announced in January 
2014, with a core team of 6. Despite having announced and presented 
Ethereum at a Bitcoin conference in the same month, the team held 
off on accepting funds until they held a crowd-sale of Ether. In regards 
to whether or not Ethereum is a cryptocurrency or not is dependent 
on whether you are referring to Ether or the platform itself. Ether is the 
digital bearer asset, which acts as a currency as well as playing a key 
part in the decentralised apps (DApps) which are located within the 
network. 

Differences Between Ethereum & Bitcoin

The interesting technology behind Ethereum proves that, while both 
Ethereum and Bitcoin are similar in terms of their cryptocurrency clas-
sification, they are two very different projects. Ethereum goes far be-
yond Bitcoin in the fact that it is not solely a stable cryptocurrency. 
Instead, Ethereum offers users a multipurpose platform, and with nu-
merous smart contract applications (Ether being a part of this), oppor-
tunities are almost endless. Even when it comes to their similarities, 
Bitcoin’s supply is capped, whereas Ether may be infinite, and Ether 
also offers much quicker confirmations and therefore transactions 
when compared to Bitcoin. With a proof-of-work algorithm which al-
lows almost any individual to mine the Ether, there’s a huge number of 
features which can be implemented.

Ethereum

DApps Ecosystem

Despite being based on the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum offers a broad 
number of differences to Bitcoin, as stated above. One of the biggest 
differences, is the DApps ecosystem which has developed through its 
infinite technology. The DApps ecosystem has led to the creation of 
some of the most exciting and innovative concepts in the cryptocur-
rency marketplace to date, with the likes of Golem, Augur and Status 
(all of which we support here at BetKing) coming to light as a result of 
the technology. 

How Does Ethereum Work?

Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is based on the protocol that stores all 
information on transaction histories within the blockchain technology 
network. However, Ethereum’s blockchain goes far beyond that, and as 
well as being able to store this information, Ethereum is also able to 
download the current information on every smart contract which exists 
within the Ethereum network. Essentially, Ethereum is able to read the 
information which has been input into the blockchain, and change its 
state in relation to what that information is describing. Each ‘state’ that 
Ethereum transitions into will consist of millions of transactions.These 
are then grouped into blocks which ultimately make up the blockchain. 
It is these blocks which need to be mined prior to transactions being 
validated, and this is a similar process to how Bitcoin mines its blocks. 
For Ethereum however, miners are the main target for the platform, 
and are ultimately the token’s backbone, as without miners, new tokens 
would not be created. 

What Can Ethereum Be Used For?

Ethereum is first and foremost a platform on which developers are able 
to build apps which are completely decentralised and unlimited. With 
some of these DApps offering an escrow service, or a platform for the 
trading of goods and services, there are plenty of different uses for 
Ethereum. When it comes to Ether on the other hand, this token can be 
used to purchase a huge number of items, and can also be used here 
at BetKing, with our ETH poker tables, and dice game.

Benefits Of Ethereum

There are three main benefits to Ethereum, which truly capitalise on 
the capabilities of the blockchain technology which makes up the plat-
form; trust, transparency and security. With the entire platform being 
decentralised, and cryptographic security which can help to protect 
against hacks, bugs, malware and other disruptive attacks, Ethere-
um’s smart contracts offer a level of security which Bitcoin is unable 
to provide. 

Disadvantages Of Ethereum

However, with advantages, comes disadvantages, and with Ethereum 
while these are very few, they need to be considered. While the smart 
contracts are designed to be faultless, this is not always the case, 
as there is still significant room for human error which can result in 
codes being mistakenly exploited. As a result of a bug which stole 3.6 
million ETH from a DAO in 2016, the trust that Ethereum deserves 
isn’t quite yet contributed towards the platform, however, the increas-
ing investment and growing standing of this particular cryptocurrency 
could see this change in the near future. 

The Future Of Ethereum 

While many people turn towards Bitcoin when looking at a cryptocur-
rency to invest in and use, those who are looking for an integrated 

03

and decentralised platform on which they can store, buy, receive and 
use their tokens should turn to Ethereum. While this cryptocurrency is 
currently in the shadow of Bitcoin, its future is certainly bright, despite 
the modest predictions from its own creator Buterin. 



04  LITECOIN
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



21BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Litecoin

 Created by former Google developer Charlie Lee, Litecoin is 
an open-source peer to peer cryptocurrency. First introduced in 2011, 
this particular cryptocurrency is a fork of the Bitcoin client and was 
actually one of the first to adopt Segregated Witness. SegWit helps 
to reduce bottlenecks within the network, as the system splits every 
transaction into two segments. This helps to drastically improve 
transaction times. 

History Of Litecoin

First available to the public in 2011, Litecoin has since expanded 
dramatically. In fact, the cryptocurrency was one of the top five cryp-
tocurrencies in relation to market cap in December 2017 and in that 
year, the Litecoin saw a huge rise. This particular cryptocurrency is 
generally deemed to be more accessible to miners and as a result, 
has continually grown in popularity. Having adopted SegWit, im-
plemented a soft fork change, and after taking part in the very first 
Lightning Network transaction, Litecoin is able to tackle the scalability 
problem which is faced by many other cryptocurrencies - in particular 
Bitcoin. It is predicted that the popularity of this particular cryptocur-
rency is likely to continue rising. 

How Is Litecoin Different To Bitcoin?

Litecoin is generally deemed to be identical to Bitcoin, and was in-
spired by this particular cryptocurrency. However, there are a number 

of technical differences which helps to differentiate the two. Firstly, 
Litecoin aims to be somewhat faster and lighter than Bitcoin as a 
whole. With a 2.5 minute block generation time, as opposed to the 10 
minutes Bitcoin offers, Litecoin can offer quicker confirmations and 
transactions. In addition to this, Litecoin also offers low fees, making 
it an important option for both commercial use and personal use. 

With the Segregated Witness process, Litecoin can offer a higher vol-
ume of transactions due to the increased rate at which transactions 
are able to verified. As a result of this increased speed, many Litecoin 
supporters also believe that Litecoin is more secure, as there is a 
reduced chance of double-spending attacks and other hack types.

Litecoin

In addition to this, Litecoin has a larger coin limit, with an upper limit 
of 84 million coins, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit. With 
script hashing, mining cannot be accelerated due to the Scrypt al-
gorithm, and as a result of Litecoin is harder to mine. This allows a 
much more level playing field when compared to Bitcoin, opening up 
new opportunities for new miners. 

Scrypt vs SHA-256 Mining

In order to mine a coin, cryptocurrencies have to use a hashing algo-
rithm. The algorithm which is in place will protect the transactions 
and data which is placed on the network in order to avoid any form 
of tampering. In order to collect coins, miners will need to crack the 
hashing and verify transactions themselves. While all forked coins 
and Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm, Litecoin opts for Scrypt in 
order to improve speed and security. 

How To Store Litecoin

There are a number of ways that you can store Litecoin, and these are 
similar to how you can store Bitcoin. If you are consistently trading 
your Litecoin, then you’re going to want to ensure that you keep some 
in your exchange. However, if you’re looking to spend, there are a 
number of Litecoin wallets that you can choose from.

These include: 

The Future Of Litecoin

While there are a number of technical differences to Bitcoin which can 
work in Litecoin’s favour, they can actually work as drawbacks too. 
While its acceptance is becoming more common as the popularity 
of Bitcoin grows, Litecoin is not as widely accepted. However, here at 
BetKing, we encourage the use of Litecoin. While Litecoin does offer 
a number of differentiations, the technical improvements may be 
deemed to be too subtle. Nevertheless, the future of Litecoin is bright. 
Litecoin’s market growth is expected to continue, and more compa-
nies are likely to adopt this particular altcoin. In addition to the current 
improvements already in place, Litecoin is continuing to implement 
changes on the network, such as Atomic Swaps. If you’re looking for 
a place to bet with Litecoin, then turn to BetKing and deposit today.

05  BETKING BANKROLL TOKEN
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



24BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

BetKing Bankroll Tokens

 Who are BetKing? We are of course! This is our eBook and with 
the success of our ICO, we implemented the use of our BKB tokens, 
which we’re talking you through in this chapter. BKB tokens can be 
used across our site, and can also be traded directly through our chat 
feature (which we’ll talk to you more about later). To find out more 
about BKB tokens, how to trade them, and our exciting bug bounty 
program, read on below!

BKB Tokens

The BetKing BKB Tokens crowdsale took place in 2017, with final 
funds of: BTC – 1,046.60623396, ETH – 4619.11055426 and LTC – 
856.08369263 being raised. BKB was created as Ethereum ERC23 
tokens, with 100,000,000 being generated as soon as the crowdsale 
ended. With a minimum of 50% being used for the house bankroll, 
BetKing quickly grew to become one of the most popular Bitcoin casi-
nos on the market. 

Trading BetKing Bankroll Tokens

At BetKing, you are able to trade your BKB tokens quickly and simply, 
all as part of our Dice game. If you have BKB tokens and you want to 
trade these for Litecoin, Bitcoin, or ETH, the BetKing chat utilises its 
connectivity features in order to allow you to do this. The chat panel 
is located just underneath our exciting Dice game. While you should 
only trade using this method with another trusted user, the entire 

process is simple. You can see who is chatting in real-time with our 
chat feature, and then click on their username in order to produce a 
panel with three options: send a tip, private chat, ignore user. In order 
to trade BetKing bankroll tokens, click ‘send a tip’ and enter the num-
ber of BKB you would like to send. It is important to remember that 
BetKing are not an exchange, and cannot act as escrow. In the future, 
you will also be able to withdraw BKB to your own ETH wallets which 
can then be traded and exchanged on various other cryptocurrency 
exchanges. 

Bug Bounty Program

As well as trading BKB’s you are also able to earn them as a reward 
for reporting any bugs on the test website. There are numerous ways 
that you can do this, and the amount of reward you will receive will be

dependent on the severity of the bug that is reported. Non-security re-
lated bugs for example, will allow you to obtain 10 stakes. Major bugs 
in any major features allow you to obtain 35 stakes, security critical 
bugs being reported will provide you with 100 stakes. However, if you 
are reporting bugs that have already been reported, then you may not 
receive any benefit from this. Also, if the bug is deemed to not make 
any difference to player experience, then you will also not be reward-
ed.

Other BKB Rewards

Alongside our bug bounty program, at BetKing, we also offered a 
number of other BKB rewards, for users who participated in spreading 
the word about the Bitcoin ICO, when this was active. Participants 
would have to complete various tasks which would allow them to 
win bounty stakes, in the exact same way as the bug bounty pro-
gram. These tasks included Bitcointalk Signature Campaigns, Twitter 
reposts, Bitcointalk translation threads and blog articles. There are 
various rules which participants needed to stick to in order to earn the 
stakes. Participants would build up their stakes, and at the end of the 
ICO, the stakes would be attributed to the participant’s account, which 
were then available to be withdrawn to an ETH address. 

Conclusion

While BKB is currently not being added to any exchanges in the near 

05

future, the extent of which you can use BKB here at BetKing can help 
to open up new gaming opportunities. As BetKing begins to expand 
its gaming options, with poker, blackjack, roulette and more, the use 
of BKB tokens is likely to further improve.  



06  OMISEGO
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



27BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

OmiseGo

 OmiseGo is the product of Thai fintech company Omise. Hav-
ing raised $25 million via their ICO in order to develop their own token 
OMG, built on the Ethereum network. The entire concept of OmiseGo 
is to disrupt traditional payment processing options, and with a de-
centralised payment platform, the opportunities this particular crypto-
currency is offering for commercial purposes, and for ease of use for 
individuals, is astonishing. Here, we’re taking a closer look at Omise-
Go, its functionality and what it can offer its users. 

History Of OmiseGo

The company behind OmiseGo was established in 2013, and already 
provides an online payment solution for customers based in Thailand, 
Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. OmiseGo was born in 2017, as an 
extension to Omise’s traditional payment solutions, and aims to rev-
olutionise the way people control and manage their financial assets. 
This will also impact how individuals exchange assets with each 
other. Through a decentralised platform, OmiseGo offers a secure and 
open platform for individuals to access anywhere in the world, sup-
ported by the innovative blockchain technology. 

How Does OmiseGo Work?

OmiseGo is very strongly related to the Ethereum project, and OMG 
is actually an ERC20 token, meaning every action initiated in Omise’s 
layer, then the Ethereum layer, will be where the action is ultimate-

ly executed. The concept behind OmiseGo is to allow international 
payments, with minimal or no exchange rate fees. For example, if 
an individual in Thailand is looking to purchase an item from the US, 
and the seller will only accept USD, then OmiseGo’s platform means 
merchants can receive the payment in the accepted currency, with 
no hassle or havoc caused. With seamless conversions completed 
in real time at the point of sale, OmiseGo is starting to transform the 
way people are purchasing and trading online. In addition to this, you 
don’t have to sign up to an account in order to use OmiseGo, which is 
one of the biggest benefits to this system.

OmiseGo

What Is OmiseGo attempting to solve?

There are two main problems that OmiseGo is attempting to solve with 
the implementation of its technology. The first is that, in Asia in particu-
lar, millions of people are ‘unbanked’ meaning they do not have access 
to any form of bank account. In fact, approximately 2 billion people 
around the world are classified as ‘unbanked’. OmiseGo offers a way for 
people to remotely send and receive funds, without having to access 
a bank account, and with people being more connected than ever, this 
offers an extremely seamless and streamlined transaction process. 
Through OmiseGo, unbanked individuals are able to access an easy and 
open solution, where they are able to convert, receive and send all types 
of money, without exchange rates and high fees. 

In addition to this, OmiseGo also wants to bridge the gap which many 
payment processors and gateways produce. The centralisation of these 
financial institutions means that there are many fully closed networks 
which makes it difficult to send and receive funds without experiencing 
delays or additional fees. OmiseGo aims to provide a universal solu-
tion, which is not controlled by a single entity, in order to offer a fair and 
cost-effective means of transfer for users. 

The Future Of OmiseGo

OmiseGo is an interesting concept, with a lot of potential for real-world 
use, which can help to further increase the value of this particular plat-

form. With OMG being used for numerous purposes, and is one of 
the tokens which you can use here at BetKing, the future is bright for 
OmiseGo. In fact, with its disruptive qualities and the rapid growth of 
the international fintech sector as a whole, it’s highly likely that OMG’s 
price will rise significantly over the next few years.

07  TRON
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



30BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Tron TRX

 Tron was initially developed as a platform which was built as 
a way to serve the entertainment industry, as users are able to freely 
publish, store and own data on the World Wide Web. Tron’s preferred 
medium of exchange comes in the form of Tronix (TXC), its very own 
cryptocurrency which was built on the Ethereum blockchain model.

Tron aims to disrupt the way information, data and earnings are pro-
cessed, consumed and shared in the entertainment industry. Ideal for 
artists, creatives and musicians who are looking to access the market 
and distribute their music, art and other content on a large scale, with-
out the middleman who will often charge extortionate fees. While this 
disruptive platform may wreak havoc for the bottom line of compa-
nies such as Amazon, YouTube, Apple and Facebook, its user experi-
ence and friendliness is one of the key features behind Tron. Here at 
BetKing, we’re taking a closer look at Tron, TXC and its benefits. 

The Founder

Tron is based in Singapore, having been developed by native Justin 
Sun. Sun is a vocal blockchain adherent, and regularly advocates the 
technology and his creation to his 350,000+ Twitter following through 
a live streaming hour. With the aim to keep in touch with both inves-
tors and partners, Sun’s hands on approach is designed to keep push-
ing TRX’s growth in the competitive cryptocurrency market. 
Having previously worked for Ripple (XRP), Sun branched out to 
create his own cryptocurrency, alongside his previous success of the 

Chinese App, Peiwo, which is touted as China’s Snapchat. In addition 
to this, Sun was also named in China 30 under 30 by Forbes back in 
2015, and again listed by Forbes in 2017 in Asia 30 under 30.

The ICO and TRX Circulation

The initial ICO took place from August 24th to 2nd September 2017, 
with an aim to raise $70million – which was reached at a phenomenal 
pace. Since the launch of TRX, it has gained considerable traction, 
and has since faced off additional competition, being now one of the 
Top 15 most promising cryptocurrencies on the market.

Tron’s total supply sits at 100 billion, and over 65 billion were already 
in circulation by January 2018, showing just how popular this particu-
lar cryptocurrency has become in such a short amount of time.

Mining and Trading of TRX

Currently, TRX cannot be mined. However, you can trade it on the 
exchanges such as Liqui and Binance with either Ethereum or Bitcoin. 
On these exchanges, new users are able to purchase BTC and ETH 
and once they have done so, deposit these funds into their wallets, 
and proceed to use them to trade TRX. Due to the fact TRX is backed 
by the ERC-20 platform, the cryptocurrency can be stored on hard-
ware wallets which are embedded within the Ethereum platform. 

Benefits for All Participants

There are a huge number of benefits for all participants using Tron, 
with one of the biggest being the way that users can participate in 
various activities, and are rewarded for doing so. If they are sharing, 
owing, creating and commenting on content that has already been 
published, then users will be provided with TRX tokens. With a long-
term goal of a decentralized internet, there’s a lot to come from this 
particular token. 

The Future of TRX

Last but not least, you need to know that TRX is a project in progress, 
and Sun (the founder) has announced possible partnerships with 
other developers to boost the technical expertise in the internet com-
merce and entertainment industry. 

Numerous developmental stages have been named in the whitepa-
per produced for TRX, with stages including: Exodus, Odyssey, Great 
Voyage and Apollo, Star Trek and Eternity. These milestones outline 
various achievements projected at each stop. 

Star Trek, for instance, envisions decentralized forecasting and a 
gaming platform, while Eternity (final stage) foresees a situation 
where monetizing and fundraising will be based on the growth of the 
community.

As you can see, with proper input and achievement on the milestones, 
Tron stands a good chance for growth, and could revolutionise the 
digital landscape.

08  EOS
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



33BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

EOS

 Similar to Ethereum in terms of functionality, the EOS network 
aims to create a platform for the development of DApps (decentral-
ised applications). The purpose of EOS is to further integrate and 
improve the services and functions of existing DApps, and open up a 
realm of opportunities and features through smart contract technol-
ogy. With numerous features such as scalability and flexibility, which 
other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum are unable to offer, EOS 
offers an exciting technological advancement in the world of DApps. 
Here at BetKing, we support the use of EOS tokens, and to help you 
understand more about the network itself, we’re taking a closer look 
at its history, and its future. 

History Of EOS

Originally created and developed by a company known as Block One, 
who have already been active in their promotion of the technology, 
EOS’ first phase Dawn 1.0 was released in 2017. Since then, Dawn 2.0 
was released in December, and Dawn 3.0 is set for release in Spring 
2018. It is this third release which is set to be the key for the network, 
and will actually be the first full and official release of the Network to 
the public. As a result, it is highly likely that we will see further im-
provements as the technology continues to progress, but for now, 
we’re taking a closer look at how the EOS network and its attributed 
EOS token works. 

How Does EOS Work?

EOS, as a decentralised operating platform, has two main standpoints 
on which it must provide in order to be successful. In fact, these 
standpoints are what has drawn so much attention to the platform, 
and through the use of blockchain technology, EOS plans on offering 
0% transaction fees, and the ability to conduct more than a million 
transactions, per second! 

The EOS network offers an existing app platform, on which develop-
ers are able to access their own data and create their own authenti-
cated apps. With server hosting and cloud storage a main component 
of the EOS network developers are able to create anything they can

imagine, without restrictions. 

EOS Tokens are ERC-20 compatible and are based on and distributed 
through the Ethereum blockchain. With 1 billion EOS tokens in circula-
tion, and a mass adoption goal, the development of the software and 
its associated DApps is an interesting one. 

Minimum DApp Requirements

DApps are a major feature behind the EOS platform, and as a result, 
there is a lot that they can offer. However, in order to be successful, 
there are numerous minimum requirements which DApps must offer. 
Firstly, DApps need to be scalable enough for a mainstream audience 

of millions of people. If a DApp becomes successful, then individuals 
are likely to find that it suits their requirements, and the requirements 
of many others around the globe. In addition to this, DApps are free 
to use, and this is a major benefit to users. Often, users will only have 
to pay for certain opt-ins from push notifications. Sequential perfor-
mance, low latency, parallel performance and being easy-to-upgrade 
are all major requirements and key features offered by DApps. 

Main Features Of EOS

EOS offers a broad range of features, and as a result, it actually tack-
les some of the main problems that other cryptocurrencies such as 
Bitcoin face. The first of such is the scalability issue which Bitcoin 
struggles with as one of its major flaws. EOS believes that, as a result 
of the distributed proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on which it is 
based, it is able to compute millions of transactions a second. To put 
this into perspective, Bitcoin is able to manage just 3-4 transactions 
per second. Even centralised platforms such as VISA is only capable 
of managing 1667 transactions per second. If this claim is correct, 
EOS could be providing an interesting pathway which many other 
cryptocurrencies who are facing a scalability problem may turn to. 

Flexibility is another major feature, and benefit of the EOS platform 
and token. Even if a DApp within the system is faulty, it is able to be 
frozen until any issues are taken care of. After the DAO attack on 
Ethereum, the whole system hit a standstill, but the separate DPOS

35BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

system on which EOS sits allowed it to continue, even in the face of 
adversity.
 
Other major features which also work as benefits for EOS and its 
token is governance, parallel processing through the use of smart 
contracts, and also self-sufficiency, which allows the cryptocurrency 
to offer longevity. While all other cryptocurrencies are decentralised, 
EOS operates as a decentralised operating system, which is possibly 
its most important feature. 

The Future Of EOS

The future of EOS is a bright one, but one of its drawbacks is that it 
is attempting to compete with Ethereum on the DApp platform land-
scape. However, with some interesting technology which Ethereum 
hasn’t quite ventured into yet, EOS may have the upper hand. Despite 
a few flaws, the EOS token has been performing well for numerous 
months, and is likely to continue on this streak as interest in DApps 
continues.

09  STATUS NETWORK
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



37BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Status Network

 The role of social media networks is to connect parties with 
common interests into a central ecosystem. Without much choice, 
participants (end users in particular) consume whatever information 
that is fed to them. Status aims to challenge the social media and 
messaging ecosphere by enabling all participants to have a con-
trolling stake in the ecosystem. Status is thus a messaging platform 
that works with Decentralized Applications (DApps) to foster free 
trade and P2P payments. For trade and other transactions on the 
platform, the Status Network Token (SNT) is used as a medium of 
exchange.

History Of SNT

SNT is built on the Etherum Blockchain technology. It was developed 
in Switzerland by founders of the software distribution network Opu-
lence, Jarrad Hope, and Carl Bennetts. The purpose of Status was to 
tackle the prevalence of social bots, which are an automated system 
designed to control social media accounts and ultimately sway public 
relations, and advocate specific ideas or thoughts. In fact, estimates 
suggest that as of 2016, approximately 47.8 million ‘users’ on Twit-
ter were actually bots. The concept behind Status is to develop a 
next-generation social networking platform, known as the socio-eco-
nomic network, which tackles this issue directly. Status’ first public 
alpha was introduced to the public on both Android and iOS in Jan-
uary 2017, and throughout the course of 2017 Q2, the user interface 
was refreshed, and stability was a key feature to be worked on. Since 
then, Status has begun to develop DApps and continue to run security 

audits. 

Status Token ICO

This particular token is what fuels the entire Status network. While 
Status is free to use, in order to access particular features, users will 
need to purchase a Status Network Token (SNT). The first SNT Token 
sale went live in 2017, and on the first day alone, 6 million SNT tokens 
(the entire supply at the time) sold out, showing just how popular Sta-
tus has been since its inception. 

In the blockchain market, developers gain credibility and investor 
confidence by declaring what they intend to do with funds collected

during an ICO. According to SNT, a percentage was set to be used by 
the core development team to implement changes and adaptations 
to the network, just over 40% was set to be attributed to crowd sale, 
whereas almost 30% was reserved for future stakeholders, and the 
remaining amount was reserved for SGT token holders.

Main Features Of Status

As an open-source platform, there are numerous features already 
implemented, and as a result of its ability to connect to all Ethereum 
DApps, the potential features are almost limitless. The whitepaper 
lists a number of pros and cons which are as follows:

• Users are able to choose which nodes within the network provide 
the service required

• Users are able to choose the push notification providers they 
would like to receive from

• Privacy levels are flexible, and as a result, users can opt in and out 
of any service on the network

• The push notification service must be paid for when users opt in

• Existing social media platforms currently offer push notification 
services free of charge

The main purpose behind Status is to give all players a choice, and 
ultimately ensure all stakeholders and SNT holders are allowed direct 
influence over the way the Status Network evolves over time. There 
is a voting protocol in place on the Network, and as a result, all SNT 
holders are able to make a decision proposal and pitch this to the 
network. 

Status Hardware Wallet

In November 2017, the introduction of the Status Hardwallet ap-
peared, which allows users to store, send and receive SNT, ETH and 
ETH-20 tokens, through a built-in-NFC. This open source can be edit-
ed and adapted to the user’s individual requirements. 

Future of Status

With its close ties to Ethereum, the future of Status mainly depends 
on how Ethereum performs over the coming years. The Status Net-
work offers an innovative and advanced decentralized platform for 
those looking for something beyond Bitcoin. With its influence as a 
community, the network, and its corresponding SNT is likely to contin-
ue to grow.

09  POPULOUS
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



40BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Populous

 Populous is a P2P Blockchain platform which facilitates the 
buying and selling of invoices online while assisting SMEs to control 
their cash flow. Simply put, it is a decentralized marketplace where 
invoice sellers meet invoice buyers. Populous is a product of a UK-
based firm by the same name.

The platform utilizes Blockchain technology to generate smart con-
tracts and enable trading. One of the unique selling points of Popu-
lous is its capacity to exchange digital tokens for fiat currency in a 
cheaper, faster and more transparent way. The platform has two to-
kens. Poken and the Populous Platform Token(PPT). Here at BetKing, 
we’re taking a closer look at the two token variants, and what this can 
mean for you and your business.

Pokens

Pokens are the immediate internal currency used for exchange on the 
platform. Their value can directly be equated to the fiat currency of a 
given nation. Pokens are ERC-20 based, and they are used for pur-
chasing invoices. 

Currently, you can buy Pokens from the platform using the Sterling 
Pound, USD, EUR, and the Yen. To purchase Pokens using other 
currencies, you need to first convert to GBP as per the London Stock 
Exchange rates. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum can also buy Pokens.

The Populous Tokens (PPT)

PPT token is the cryptocurrency that was floated during the Populous 
ICO. They are the investment products tradable on the platform. One 
of the investment options to utilize PPT is to trade invoices.

For traders who have invested their PPT tokens in invoices, the tokens 
are put up as collateral, and they receive Pokens. Pokens are then 
used to buy the invoices. Once the invoice is repaid from a sale, inves-
tors gain profit, and their PPT investment is refunded. This becomes 
the cycle of PPT investment.

Populous

Populous ICO

Populous chose to issue its token to investors through the experimen-
tal pre-sale module. The sale yielded handsomely; $10million was 
raised. The number of tokens issued was 53.2 million and it is esti-
mated that around 41.2 million tokens are in circulation. The pre-sale 
exercise, which took place on 24th July 2017 attracted 1200 inves-
tors, and it was lauded because it didn’t clog the Ethereum network as 
witnessed in other previous ICOs.

How Populous Works

Invoice sellers begin the process by registering their companies. The 
account is then put on hold until the Populous administrator ap-
proves. 

In the meantime, the administrator conducts due diligence on your 
company. Upon approval, the seller is allowed to submit an invoice 
and place a minimum sale target. The administrator must also ap-
prove the target. 

Once all these conditions are met, invoices are put on the auction 
within a 24-hour period. If the seller’s sale target is not achieved within 
the stipulated time, the seller can accept the best available bid, cancel 
the action or repeat the process all over. After a successful sale is 
made, the seller receives Pokens which can be exchanged with fiat.

The Future Of Populous

The numerous features included as part of the Populous platform 
is one of the major reasons as to why the cryptocurrency is likely to 
bode well on the cryptocurrency market. The module used is drawn 
from the traditional financial markets where business people want to 
get the fastest, most affordable and reliable deals for their invoices. 
A blockchain product such as this is able to offer a solution for busi-
nesses and individuals who are facing a serious impediment when it 
comes to invoicing. Ultimately, Populous has a bright future.

11  GOLEM
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



43BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Golem

 Golem is a new blockchain technology that will entirely change 
the way computing systems are developed, distributed and con-
sumed. Founded in Switzerland by Julian Zawistowski, Golem con-
nects software developers and users on a platform where they can 
share resources. In other words, the Golem platform is a marketplace 
where App developers and individual users, also referred to as re-
questers, rent resources from other users, referred to as providers, to 
carry out particular tasks. 

History Of Golem

The concept behind Golem was for the crypto-token to become the 
AirBnB of computing, and aimed to create the first global market for 
idle computer power. Golem is a new crypto-token, and soared to 
success as it raised more than $8.6 million in just 29 minutes in order 
to help fund the production of GNT. Now, Golem is the third largest 
ICO, behind Ethereum, and is continuing to expand with new releases 
ready to be introduced throughout 2018. 

What Is Golem?

To understand Golem even better, think of what cloud computing 
providers (such as Google, Amazon IBM) do. Primarily, they act as 
hosts for applications and data on behalf of developers and consum-
ers. These providers operate in a “closed network” with hard-coded 
operational needs only accessible and understandable by the inner 

circuit. Golem will challenge this kind of operation by “using personal 
computers to do what is done by servers.”

Unlike the traditional computing ecosystems that are only best un-
derstood by providers, Golem allows interested parties to make their 
own coding, add, use and even rent from peers within the platform. 
Ultimately, Golem provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS) as well 
as Platform-as-a-Service. To enable transactions, the Golem Network 
Token(GNT) built on the Ethereum Blockchain is used as the unit of 
exchange. 

The GNT token was released to investors through an ICO on 13th No-
vember 2016. The ICO raised $8.6 million, and these funds have been 
earmarked for the advancement of the project. In fact, Golem became

Golem

one of the fastest closing ICOs, taking place in under 30 minutes and 
raising the anticipated amount successfully.

The Golem Application Registry

Besides GNT, the application registry is one of the essential elements 
of Golem. It is an Ethereum smart contract where anyone can publish 
applications that are supported by the Golem network. Once apps are 
published, they will be available to requestors looking for tools to allow 
them to carry out specific tasks.  

Users of the application registry are categorized as Authors, Validators, 
and Providers. Authors publish applications while Validators review and 
certify them for safety and trust. They can also highlight applications as 
malicious by adding them to a blacklist. 

Golem’s Application In Computer Technology

An example of Golem’s application in computer technology can be 
applied to computer graphics. For example, if you consider a comput-
er graphics artist who bought GNT computing power to enhance their 
work and in this case, they have an animation to render. From Golem’s 
estimate, this can be done by say five machines, each putting in an hour 
of work. Because the network is made up of a wide pool of contributors, 
there are several ‘idle’ computers to rent at any given time. Each of the 
selected five idle computers automatically receives a GNT (or a number 

of GNTs as agreed). 

Here, the power of using excess or idle computers brings efficiency. 
A provider who has rented out his computer for use on the platform 
earns some money. At the same time, participants who want to per-
form special tasks that require specialized software have an opportu-
nity to make arrangements with relevant providers.

The Golem Roadmap

Golem is under continuous development, and the Golem team (led by 
the Founder and CEO, Julian Zawistowski) has broken down planned 
milestones through which it will release supportive software to the 
platform. 

The team clarifies that a lot of effort will be concentrated around 
research and descriptions will be provided via technical white papers. 
Golem’s milestones include the release of the following software; 
Brass Golem, Clay Golem, Stone Golem, Iron Golem, and Legend.

Brass Golem 
Brass Golem mainly targets CGI artists. While it has already made 
significant progress, frequent updates will incessantly change its 
operations.

11



45BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Golem

Clay Golem 
At this stage, the task API and the application registry are introduced, 
making Golem a multi-purpose computation platform and developers 
now come on board.

Stone Golem 
This stage of development is where more security and stability is en-
hanced.

Iron Golem 
Developers are given more powers to create applications that use inter-
net connection as well as those that can operate outside this scope.

11

The Future Of Golem

While Golem cannot be mined, users can obtain Golem by participat-
ing in various activities on the platform. Participants selling comput-
ing power install the Golem software (available for Windows, Mac 
and Linux operating systems) and automatically accept and process 
tasks since they get paid in return. 

Ultimately, the long-term value of GNT will be dependent on network 
turnover and how often transactions take place. The successful com-
pletion of the various milestones outlined and their absorption by the 
market will also influence the future performance of Golem.

12  AUGUR
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



47BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Augur

 Quite simply, Augur is a decentralised platform which is based 
within the prediction industry, in which users can bet on the out-
come of an event in order to win monetary rewards. With the use of 
real-time predictive data used, and the opportunity to enjoy minimal 
fees and greater accessibility, there are plenty of opportunities which 
Augur presents. Here at BetKing, we’re taking a closer look at the 
cryptocurrency and the platform itself. 

History Of Augur

Augur was initially founded back in 2014, and the alpha of the con-
cept was quickly released soon after its inception. The first Augur 
contract was uploaded to the Ethereum network in 2015, and in June 
the general public were able to access and test this cryptocurrency. 
Initially, the platform announced that 8.8 reputation tokens were to be 
distributed to their investors in an attempt to raise up to $5.2 million 
by the beginning of October 2015. After all of this funding, tweaks, ap-
plication amendments and more, the beta version was finally released 
to the public in March 2016, making Augur a significantly longstand-
ing player in the Ethereum token market of recent times. 

How Does Augur Work?

The concept of Augur was built around its tradeable Reputation (REP) 
tokens, of which there is a total of 11 million. Augur coins cannot be 
mined, and can only be mined by those who predict the outcome of a 

report or an event. If the right prediction is made, participants will be 
rewarded with tokens, and those who actually reported untruthfully 
may end up losing some of the tokens they may have been previ-
ously rewarded with. The whole concept is based on user reliability, 
and while Augur is not a betting platform, it is used for those who are 
looking to report event outcomes. The platform allows both Ether and 
BTC transactions, and Augur’s algorithm collates all of the data gath-
ered from the network in order to produce the right results. 

Pros Of Augur

Augur is an interesting platform, and there are numerous benefits to 
opting for this token. Augur is based completely on user’s predictions, 
and with the decentralised platform accepting both ETH and BTC, the

Augur

platform is accessible to all. The concept is simple to understand, and 
users are able to quickly and easily place their predictions in order to 
be rewarded with Augur coins and build up their balance. 

Cons Of Augur

While BTC and ETH are accepted on the platform, aside from this 
the payment methods are somewhat limited. This means that those 
using other ETH tokens, such as Golem, or those who opt for other 
cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin are unable to access and use the 
platform as requested. 

The Future Of Augur

Augur is an interesting platform that is highly likely to come into its 
own as the years progress. It is a very different type of cryptocurrency, 
and is looking to truly revolutionise the entire prediction industry with 
its rewards and penalties system. Many supporters believe Augur is 
likely to set new price records throughout 2018, but its future certainly 
relies on the success of the Ethereum network.

13  VERITASEUM
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



50BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Veritaseum

 Veritaseum is generally associated with providing its users 
with numerous tools which are focused towards the trading and 
financial industries and markets. While Veritaseum is made up of 
numerous components, possibly the most important and main com-
ponent is the Veritaseum Autonomous, Dynamic, Interactive Research 
(VeADIR) trading platform. This particular financial component and 
machine offers a number of trading opportunities to its users, and will 
highlight the under-reported assets and those which are in strong buy 
positions, which is unlike almost any other trading platform. Here at 
BetKing, we’re taking a closer look at VeADIR, the platform as a whole 
and also the VERI token supply, which we accept as a token on our 
site.

History Of Veritaseum & VeADIR

Having predicted the housing collapse and global recession in 2008 
and voicing strong opinions on this, Reggie Middleton, founder of 
Veritaseum, was inspired to develop the dynamic platform. Middleton 
teamed up with lead engineer Patryk Dworznik in order to develop the 
revolutionary trading platform, which claims to outperform every trad-
ing platform on the market. While access to the platform is somewhat 
limited to the public, and a high price tag is attached to the platform 
(unlike many of the other blockchain based platforms), the features of 
the platform can be as good as the technology suggests. 

How Does Veritaseum & VeADIR Work?

VeADIR is a dynamic platform which actually operates through smart 
contracts. Having been built on the Ethereum blockchain, and being 
made famous mainly as a result of the ICO reportedly being hacked, 
there is very little technological information regarding Veritaseum 
available. As the platform is not hugely accessible, it appears that 
only users of the platform are able to understand the true extent of 
how it works, however it has continued to maintain a relatively high 
token value, despite other tokens such as OmiseGo which offers 
international functionality and scalability, barely breaking into double 
digits. 

The concept behind Veritaseum is to develop into a peer-to-peer

capital market gateway, allowing all intermediaries such as brokers, 
banks and funds to be cut out of investments and funds. Facilitated 
by the smart contracts located on the blockchain, despite there being 
no specific roadmap as such as of yet, there is a lot of potential within 
this network. 

VERI Supply

One of the main criticisms related to Veritaseum is the minimal sup-
ply of tokens in circulation. Despite the VERI currency being capped 
at 100 million tokens, a total amount of 2,036,645 are actually ac-
cessible for purchase or exchange. The remaining 97.9% of VERI 
tokens however, are actually owned by the CEO, meaning prices of the 
currency are currently extremely unstable. If the CEO was to re-enter 
even just a small proportion of his share, the currency would enter 
a freefall, which could ultimately destroy the Veritaseum platform 
itself. Despite the risk of investment however, many supporters of the 
crypto token and its niche platform, believe that there are certain uses 
which only users to the platform itself will fully comprehend. 

The Future Of Veritaseum

It is difficult to predict the future of Veritaseum and its token VERI 
due to the secretive nature of the platform. Despite no-end of support 
from the team behind the technology, the distributed and serverless 
software is relatively ambiguous. However, having already reached 
high token values, and currently maintaining these, the future could 

remain bright for the platform – only time will tell. At BetKing, you can 
use VERI to wager on our dice game.

14  SALT
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



53BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

SALT

 SALT is a “utility token” created for the sole purpose of giv-
ing the holder of that token access to the SALT platform. SALT is an 
innovative new technology, and stands for Secure Automated Lend-
ing Technology. This platform offers a streamlined lending option for 
those looking to intuitively manage loans in a brand new way. Along-
side this platform, came the SALT Token, which we’re taking a look at 
below. 

What Is SALT?

SALT has a huge number of people working behind the scenes in 
order to develop an excellent user experience for all who use the plat-
form. The leadership of SALT is accumulated by the following peple: 
advisor Erik Voorhees, CEO Shawn Owen, compliance specialist Josef 
Schaible, and many others in the business development, strategy, 
finance, creative, technology and product sectors of the business. 
The concept behind SALT may seem complex at first, but here we’re 
attempting to break it down for you.

Once access is gained to the SALT platform, the holder has the op-
portunity to take out a fiat loan in exchange for their BTC holdings. 
For instance, a one year membership (which is paid for with 1 SALT 
Token) gives the holder access to a loan of up to $10k. To obtain that 
loan the user merely needs to deposit the appropriate amount of BTC 
(generally around 10% above the amount of the loan) into the plat-
form’s escrow system to be held as collateral. Then the appropriate 

amount of fiat is deposited into the user’s US-based bank account. 
The refreshing side of this particular loan system is that is focuses far 
more on the collateral, than on credit scores, opening up new possibil-
ities for those who may have previously struggled to obtain a loan. 

From there the user (aka borrower) merely pays back monthly fiat 
payments to pay off the loan just as any other; and, upon final payoff, 
they get their BTC released (which will likely have grown in value far 
beyond the interest paid on the loan).

How Does The Whole System Work?

The short answer to this is through the Smart Contract tied to the 
SALT Token itself. SALT is an ERC20, Ethereum-based token. So, since 
SALT lives on the ETH blockchain, it comes ready-made with a Smart

SALT

Contract, and SALT’s Smart Contract controls the entire process from 
beginning to end.

The membership itself is timed and controlled by the presentation 
of the actual membership token paid upon signing up. Then, once 
a lender and borrower meet, that Smart Contract allows them to 
choose the specific terms of the loan.Those terms are monitored and 
controlled by that same Smart Contract; as is the escrow control of 
the BTC being used as collateral.

Once the loan is paid off, the Smart Contract finalizes the process by 
releasing the collateral and completing the agreement. So, the SALT 

token is a very specific tool used to automate the loan process that is 
the very basis of the SALT platform itself. 

What Are SALT Tokens?

As a ‘utility token’ SALT is not intended to be a commodity. Although 
SALT has been traded on a number of exchanges at various prices, 
the price and value of the SALT Token is set, solely at the discretion of 
the SALT Team, at $25. This means that 1 SALT = $25 USD.
The only intended use for these tokens is as outlined herein; to gain 
membership to the platform. Or, that was the original use. Now, since 
the launch of the platform in December 2017, SALT tokens can now 
be used to purchase merchandise on the platform. SALT tokens can 
also be used as collateral (in place of BTC) and/or to pay off principle 
and interest on SALT platform loans.

In short, the SALT token can be used to purchase any good, or pay for 
any service, through the SALT platform at the set rate of 1 SALT = $25 
USD.

Using SALT Tokens On The Platform

Generally, SALT tokens were designed to be used as payment for 
membership to use the site. Currently there are more than 46,000,000 
SALT circulating out of a total supply of 120,000,000. SALT integrates 
the use of Ethereum wallets (due to the Smart Contract element of

SALT

the site), and are actually an Ethereum ERC-20 token, under a different 
name. Basic membership to the site will cost 1 SALT, and premium 
membership will be approximately 30 SALT, per year. 

The Benefits Of SALT

Not only is the entire platform extremely user friendly, so even the 
newest of users are able to apply for a loan on this platform quickly 
and easily, but SALT also offer highly competitive loan rates. In ad-
dition, when you choose SALT, you can also benefit from complete 

freedom, and you are able to use SALT to obtain cash for anything you 
would like - there doesn’t have to be a specific and secure reason. So 
far, SALT is the only platform which was designed with the sole in-
tention of being able to facilitate loans from the platform, but with its 
extreme popularity, other areas such as derivatives, deeds and more 
are beginning to tentatively turn towards this disruptive technology. 
Whether you’re a day trader, a long-term investor, a remittance ser-
vice, an ICO, a blockchain miner or an exchange, SALT offers a broad 
number of benefits to all.

15  BASIC ATTENTION TOKEN
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



57BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Basic Attention Token

 With so many issues in the digital advertising world, the Basic 
Attention Token was developed to provide an in-depth and effective 
fix. The current online advertising landscape sees a huge number of 
users being unknowingly tracked, publishers being unable to monetize 
any of the content they are producing, and even fraudulent activities 
impacting numerous advertisers. Based on Ethereum Basic Attention 
Token (BAT) is designed to tackle all of these issues. Here at BetKing, 
we accept BAT to be used on our exciting dice game so if you’re a fan 
of this particular token, there’s plenty to enjoy. We’re taking a closer 
look at how BAT works, its benefits and its future outlook. 

How Does BAT Work?

The process of BAT is simple – with two main companies dominating 
the digital advertising landscape (Google and Facebook), BAT’s aim 
is to move this monopolised system away from this imposing dom-
inance. Essentially, BAT wants to revolutionise the online digital ad-
vertising landscape. The concept of BAT is to cut out the middleman, 
meaning users are paid to watch ads and publishers will receive ad 
revenue directly; it’s as simple as that. With better ROI and excellent 
data analytics, targeted ads can perform much better, and no two 
entities will dominate the market. 

Currently, there is only one web browser which is able to use BAT, and 
that is Brave, which was actually developed by the same team. How-
ever, the roadmap BAT has put in place suggests that the platform is 

aiming to be integrated by a huge number of other apps and browsers 
as soon as the end of 2018. On the platform, you are able to spend 
your BAT on numerous activities, including:

• Premium articles
• Premium products
• Donations 
• Photos
• Data

Basic Attention Token

History Of BAT

BAT is still in its infancy, as the platform itself was only announced in 
March 2017. However, its token sale raised a whopping $35 million, in 
under 30 seconds! Currently, just over 1 billion BAT tokens are in circu-
lation. While some cryptocurrencies can be mined or staked, BAT can-
not be. Instead, 300 million tokens are situated within a user growth 
pool. Once this user growth pool is emptied, no more BAT tokens will 
enter circulation. The most interesting part of BAT however, is in fact, 
its founder Brendan Eich. If you’re not sure who Brendan Eich is by 
the name, or you’re just unsure where you’ve heard the name before, 
it’s important to know that Eich is actually the creator of Javascript, 
and also co-founded Mozilla, which led to the browser project Firefox. 
While currently only implemented on Brave, it’s highly likely that this 
association will see Firefox becoming a leader in adopting BAT. 

Benefits Of BAT

There are a huge number of benefits to BAT. Firstly, its aim is to create 
not only a level playing field, but one which benefits both the adver-
tisers and the users as part of the digital advertising landscape. The 
integrated token and the browser, Brave, offers a new level of privacy 
and security for users, without any intrusive ads or unrecognisable 
trackers which will monitor users’ behaviour discreetly, so as to not 
be picked up. With an extra HTTPS layer on every site you can access, 
and a background ledger system which ensures all publishers are 
paid according to the time you spend on the site, the fair and anony-

mous system is revolutionary. 

The Future Of BAT

With a huge number of real-life attributions, BAT is highly likely to 
continue its growth. Currently, due to the fact that the token is not af-
fected by any development milestones, it has more or less replicated 
and shadowed the growth of Bitcoin. With a successful team leading 
the project, despite its youth, it’s highly likely that BAT will continue to 
improve and retain its success as it continues to grow.

the fact that it uses the Ethereum blockchain and protocol helping to 
ensure the technology remains fair and fast, FunFair can offer new 
opportunities which other cryptocurrencies and platforms cannot. 
FunFair operates a decentralised platform, with no server. This means 
that there is minimal risk to operators and also users. With blockchain 
and smart contracts both used in order to provide optimum security, 
FunFair is a safe and secure opportunity for casinos. Included within 
this FunFair network is their very own FUN tokens, which operates as 
a reward system. 

FUN Tokens

FUN tokens are the platform’s native cryptocurrency, and this power-
ful gaming ecosystem allows players to enjoy an extremely exciting 
and streamlined experience. Game developers who use the FunFair 
network are rewarded with FUN when their games go live. FUN is a

The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



63BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Power Ledger

 Power Ledger is a decentralised application, which aims to 
provide local areas with the ability to sell solar power to neighbours. 
Without the need for a middle-man, or a big utility company, this plat-
form is aiming to push renewable energy in a sustainable, unmatched 
way. Combining numerous innovations, this exciting technology utilis-
es both blockchain technology and the current research around solar 
polar, the future is bright for Power Ledger. Here at BetKing, we’re tak-
ing a closer look at the technology, and the Power Ledger token which 
you can use here on our site!

History Of Power Ledger

Having been founded in May 2016, Power Ledger was designed to 
quickly accomplish a number of significant milestones in a short 
period of time. It was August 2016 when Power Ledger was first im-
plemented in Australia and trialled as a way to trade energy. In 2017, 
the platform then deployed an additional commercial energy manage-
ment bi-product of the business, which was designed to help improve 
the transparency of renewable energy distribution in high-density 
housing. As Power Ledger continues to grow, the platform continues 
to push for a revolution in the worldwide energy industry. 

How Power Ledger Works

Ultimately, the Power Ledger platform forms peer-to-peer energy 
transactions, allowing real-time consumption and also generation. 

Power Ledger operates on two blockchain ledgers. With two tokens 
involved within this particular platform (Sparkz and POWR), and being 
based on the public Ethereum blockchain, there’s a lot of opportunity 
for growth with this particular technology. Both of these tokens have 
two completely different functions:

Power Ledger Token (POWR)

These tokens allow application hosts and participants access to the 
platform. An application host may not access the platform if they do 
not have the correct amount of POWR and this will need to be traded 
and put into escrow in order to be exchanged for Sparkz. Then comes 
the process of obtaining POWR to access the platform. The fixed sup-
ply of Power Tokens sits at 1,000,000,000. The cryptocurrency market

Power Ledger

has ultimate control over the stability of this token. POWR is the token 
which you can use here at BetKing. 

Sparkz 

Sparkz on the other hand, is actually purchased using regular fiat cur-
rencies, which can be processed using individual trading platforms. 
These platforms will have specific energy exchanges, and specific 
Sparkz exchanges. Essentially, customers will pay for the Sparkz and 
then trade this token in order to obtain electricity. Sparkz on the other 
hand, is unfixed due to its purposes, and instead will be generated and 
destroyed where appropriate. Sparkz is also tethered to government 
fiat currency and also the cost of power, which helps to ensure its 
overall stability.
 

Benefits Of Power Ledger

There are a huge number of benefits which Power Ledger offers its 
users and also the entire ecosystem as a whole. Some of the major 
benefits include:

• Solar energy creation and battery storage improvements
• Easier access to renewable energy at affordable prices
• A decrease in wastage of electricity in transmission

The Future Of Power Ledger

Power Ledger is a blockchain-based marketplace and it has the 
power to truly revolutionise the distribution of power and renewable 
energy on a global scale. With local communities able to access this 
power, and distribute it as they please without the middle-man, Power 
Ledger is certainly one to watch. The operation is already currently in 
three continents, and with multiple applications already planned for 
the very near future, Power Ledger is almost certain to grow drastical-
ly in the coming years.

TenX

 TenX is a decentralised digital wallet which you can spend 
your cryptocurrencies with. Also available in physical card format, it 
allows users to spend their cryptocurrency at any possible store of 
their choosing - even if the store itself does not accept cryptocurrency 
payments. Despite the growing popularity of Bitcoin and other cryp-
tocurrencies, there are only a few places where you are able to spend 
the crypto. While large corporations such as Subway, Microsoft, 
PlayStation and Steam all accept these, if you’re looking to purchase 
clothing or other general supermarket products, cryptocurrencies are 
not necessarily an option. Nevertheless, TenX was introduced in order 
to change this. Here at BetKing, we’re taking a closer look at TenX, 
where it came from and its token supply, so you know exactly how 
you can use it on our site. 

How Does TenX Work?

The concept behind TenX is simple - make cryptocurrencies as acces-
sible as possible, and help to ensure that the blockchain is spendable. 
In order to achieve this main mission, a wallet and physical card was 
created in order to ensure that payments across blockchains are 
made possible to all individuals who have access. With wallets avail-
able on almost any Android or iOS phone, as well as the World Wide 
Web, almost everyone in the world is able to access this payment 
method.

Decentralised Security Smart Contracts

This is the part of TenX which allows you to set particular spending 
rules and regulations, so you are able to put features like purchase 
limits in place. In addition to this, you may even want to monitor your 
daily spend, or your withdrawal limits, meaning you are in complete 
control of your digital assets at all times. TenX also offers a high level 
of flexibility through the Smart Contract system, and with its links to 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and a huge range of other alt coins and to-
kens, you are able to choose the percentage of how much you would 
like to spend from each different cryptocurrency within your wallet. 
In the future, towards the end of 2018, TenX has road mapped that 
it plans on being able to introduce certain developer tools for mer-
chants, businesses and more, in order to expand their service beyond

their app and the debit card functionality. 

COMIT Routing Protocol (CRP)

A main feature of TenX is the CRP, also known as the COMIT Routing 
Protocol. This aims to ensure that any new blockchain which appears 
within the network is able to seamlessly connect with an existing 
block, as well as determine how these two blocks communicate with 
each other. This is currently similar to how the TCP/IP protocol works 
of the World Wide Web, however it will be much more streamlined, 
and of course, far more efficient due to the blockchain technology 
on which it is based. Quite simply, if this was to be put in place and 
work, assets will be able to be exchanged with 0 transaction fees and 
instant withdrawals and deposits. 

TenX

Currently, TenX does not associate itself with any fees when it comes 
to transactions. Instead, users are charged a one off joining fee in 
order to obtain the ‘debit’ card and a fee for the digital card also (al-
though the latter is much smaller). With no annual fee, unless you are 
spending less than $1000 per year, TenX is accessible to all. 
A key feature of TenX is their reward system, with which you can 
receive either Ethereum (if you are holding PAY tokens within your 
ewallet), or you can be rewarded with PAY tokens every time you 
use your debit card. Interestingly, there are less than 105 million PAY 

tokens currently in circulation, and this is approximately 51% of the 
entire supply. 

Future of TenX 

While the team behind TenX doesn’t offer valuable experience in 
blockchain technology, the technical plan behind the project is cer-
tainly solid. Despite certain regulatory issues which could come to 
light in the near future, TenX offers an new and innovative way to 
transfer funds, purchase products and ultimately use a debit card-like 
feature in a brand new way. TenX is still drastically in its infancy, and 
as a result, it’ll be interesting to see how much growth this particular 
cryptocurrency will have in the near future.

0x

 Designed as a decentralised exchange developed from the 
Ethereum blockchain, 0x offers users a smart-contract based service 
with a combination of features. 0x believes in providing users with an 
efficient and trustworthy platform for users to exchange tokens devel-
oped from the Ethereum network. With a combination of uses from 
the centralised and decentralised exchanges on which 0x integrates 
and is designed from, users can benefit from the best of both worlds. 
Here at BetKing, we’re taking a closer look at what 0x offers its users. 

History Of 0x 

The 0x project was founded by two men: Will Warren and Amir Ban-
deali, both of whom have previously worked with smart contracts and 
development. In addition to the two co-founders, the 0x project is built 
up by numerous other blockchain and software engineers, business 
strategists and many other individuals who have also worked with 
or even founded other successful blockchain technology-focused 
businesses such as Polychain Capital, Coinbase and more. Having 
co-founded the project back in 2016, the sole focus on the project 
was to improve the inefficiencies of current decentralised exchanges 
on the market and develop an integrated centralised and decentral-
ised exchange allowing the key elements of both to work seamlessly 
together. 

The Differences Between Centralised  
& Decentralised Exchanges

The most common type of cryptocurrency exchange is a centralised 
exchange, which is run by a single entity. In order to use these, users 
will deposit funds and the exchange will then become responsible for 
ensuring all buying and selling orders are connected in the real-time. 
With centralised exchanges, there is a large risk of hacks being easily 
carried out, or the administrator of the exchange manipulating data 
in order to make the exchange profitable for him. Decentralised ex-
changes were initially created in order to reduce this level of vulner-
ability, helping users to have more of a control over their own funds.

0x

With decentralised wallets, the use of smart contracts and digital sig-
natures helps to authorise trading orders. However, the main down-
side to decentralised exchanges is the fact that they are much slower 
than a centralised exchange. As you can see, there are key benefits 
and drawbacks to both centralised and decentralised exchanges, 
which is why 0x was designed to integrate the best of both worlds. 

How Does 0x Work?

0x’s decentralised trading generally focuses on off-chain ordering, 
which can help to ensure the network doesn’t bloat. With decentral-
ised exchanges functioning with help from smart contracts in the 
Ethereum network, all orders and trades must take place within these. 

This means that every time a user wants to manage their funds, they 
must execute transactions on the blockchain, which can cost what’s 
known as ‘gas’. The amount of ‘gas’ a transaction will cost the user 
will depend on how extensive the transaction is, and this is paid in 
ETH. The 0x protocol aims to improve this complicated process by 
helping to utilise off-chain orders with on-chain settlements, which 
helps to reduce the gas fees associated with trading. In layman’s 
terms, the only time a transaction will be run through the network is 
when a trade is executed, through the use of ‘relayers’. Relayers are 
those who are responsible for broadcasting any orders in the network, 
and these orders are known as Broadcast Orders. In addition to this, 
0x will also allow Point-to-Point Orders, which allows users to transfer 
funds through messaging networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, 
email and more. 

Where does 0x OTC come in?

The 0x protocol described above can be confusing, particularly for 
those who are new to the cryptocurrency world. In addition to this, 
the 0x team created their own consumer facing product, known as 
0x OTC, which can help to cut out the Relayer process of the proto-
col. This is easy to use, and allows users to exchange ETH between 
themselves, directly. All you have to do is send a link to who you want 
to send funds to (the counterparty), and send the order.

0x (ZRX) Tokens

ZRX tokens are unique tokens which are built on the Ethereum net-
work, which is what we support here at BetKing. This token is what is 
used by traders who are paying Relayers’ fees, and is a decentralised 
part of the system. With a fixed supply of 1 billion ZRX, it’s highly likely 
that this interesting and versatile technology will be one to watch as 
the years go on. 

The Future Of 0x

While the future of 0x will be very much dependent on the success 
of the Ethereum blockchain, its availability helps supporters to pre-
dict that this technology is likely to grow very quickly in popularity. 
While its nowhere near the trading size of Bitcoin (unsurprisingly), and 
currently no projects set to be actively launched, if you are looking to 
invest and use this crypto token, then the time would be now, before it 
become proven and the prices skyrocket.

20  CIVIC
The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies



73BetKing - The Ultimate Guide To Cryptocurrencies

Civic

 Civic was developed in age of consistent identity theft. With 
technology on the rise, being able to steal identities is becoming 
increasingly easier, and as a result more and more individuals are 
suffering from their identities being stolen, and affected by fraudulent 
activities. Civic was initially designed with the purpose to redefine dig-
ital identity, to ensure online users were protected against any kind of 
theft at any stage of their online journey. Here at BetKing, we’re taking 
a closer look at what Civic and Civic Coin (CVC) offers its users, and 
just why it is so important in the digital age. 

History Of Civic

Launching their ICO on the 22nd of June 2017, Civic bought in $30 
million from the ICO in order to continue the development of the 
project. Made up of a series of banking and digital platform special-
ists such as Vinny Lingham (founder of Gyft) and Jonathan Smith (a 
banking and technology advisory), Civic was developed as a way to 
provide security for online identities. 

How Does CVC Work?

The entire concept behind CVC is to provide multi-step verification 
and authentication, without the need to create a username and pass-
word, or use a third party authenticator. In addition to this, CVC does 
not require the use of a physical hardware token, and everything is run 
solely through the blockchain network. 

As a premium platform, there are two different versions that users 
can opt for - a free or a paid for version. This is entirely dependent on 
the individual needs of the user, how much insurance and how much 
protection they require. Using something known as a secure identity 
platform (SIP), CVC is able to run off of a voluntary exchange between 
the user and the identity requestor, with the SIP securely sharing all 
valid data. Once an individual download is complete, Civic will create 
an account, verify the identity, and they will then, in turn, become a 
user.

How Does Civic Verify Data?

Civic is providing a whole new age of data verification in order to re-
duce the amount of identity theft found in the digital landscape. There 
are numerous ways in which Civic will verify data and therefore the 
identity of an individual user. Firstly, any data which is entered onto 
the platform will be run through numerous identity service providers 
in order to ensure all data is correct and valid. Through the use of 
more than just one data service provider, all fraudulent activity can be 
mitigated. Alongside this, Civic APIs will partner with third party data 
verification parties, which can help to push verified data through the 
blockchain in order to ensure it is wholly accurate.

If a user is accessing the Civic platform via a mobile device, then bi-
ometric enabled security can be used in order to ensure that all iden-
tity data is completely encrypted. This is generally through the use of 
fingerprint scanning and/or facial recognition. 

The Benefits Of Civic

With the extensive security measures in place, there are a huge num-
ber of benefits when it comes to using Civic. Some of the key benefits 
include:

No proprietary software or infrastructure in order to ensure that no 
unnecessary safety precautions are put in place which are costly. 

In addition to this, the authenticating authority also has the right to 
revoke any data, meaning if somebody changes something in their 
identity (such as their last name or phone number) then the original 
information can be changed and removed from the platform. 

The Future Of CVC

With the next generation of security being developed through Civic, 
it’ll be surprising if this particular platform was to ever start crashing. 
With more people becoming victims of identity fraud, and the world 
slowly turning into the Big Brother-like capacity which was predicted 
in George Orwell’s 1984, the identity protection offered by this particu-
lar technology is likely to boom.
