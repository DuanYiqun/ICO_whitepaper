According to the World Bank’s Financial Inclusion Database, 

as of 2015, almost two-thirds of the populations of just �ve 

countries - Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria, Colombia, and 

Peru (a combined 630 million people) - remain unbanked. 

If one includes all middle income and developing nations, 

that number rises to a whopping 3 billion-plus humans 

without access to a bank account, let alone access to basic 

�nancial tools such as a debit card. Despite leaps made

by �nancial technologies in the past few decades, it is

clear that accesss to simple, 21st century �nancial utilities 

remains shockingly low.

Digital payments are the solution that will provide entry 

to �nancial inclusion for these billions of people, That said,

�nancial exclusion still remains, in large part, because 

most merchants in underserved demographics still deal 

only in cash. These micro and small businesses (MSMs) - 

the local food vendors, gasoline stands, mobile phone 

kiosks - the lifelines for most people, represent over USD 

6.5 trillion in transactions annually. Yet less than 10% of 

these merchants currently accept digital payments.

In 2017, more than 2 billion adults and up to 39% of the total global 

population still do not have access to a bank account. In developing 

countries, that number is even higher. 

Abstract

03

disincentivizes digital payments for MSMs. Payment 

terminals involve long, ine�cient application processes,

Moreover, the current �nancial infraestructure further

connectivity historically has been poor, and card payment 

fees are too high to justify operating in anything but cash. 

Similarly, service providers have thus seen little reason to 

invest in the infrastructure to bring these billions of people 

into the modern digital �nancial system.

opportunity to change that. Against a backdrop of rising 

Blockchain technology and crytocurrencies o�er an

mobile device adoption (global smartphone user base 

to increase by ~1.6 billion in the next 3 years), the barrier 

for people to potentially transact securely, transparently 

and conveniently has never been lower. BELUGA aims 

to leverage these new technologies to develop an open 

source asset transferring platform. By thus providing 

the tools for small businesses and their customers in 

developing countries to go digital, it is BELUGA’s mission to 

help the unbanked billions become part of a newer, better, 

and fairer global �nancial system.

BELUGA will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction it 

operates in, with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-

Money Laundering (AML) processes.

How It Works

BELUGA Point of Sale, BELUGA Restaurant Edition, BELUGA 

Peer 2 Peer and BELUGA Payment Data suite platforms will

enable transactions in Fiat and Crypto currencies. You can

buy or sell your products and services in Fiat and

before. All of our platforms are made to run on a common 

BELUGA Blockchain in order to give a uni�ed experience to

Crypto currencies in Beluga more e�ciently than ever

merchants and to make their life easier.

Consumer buys a product or consumes a service 

from a merchant using one of our products. For 

example a customer orders food in a restaurant 

using BELUGA’s Restaurant Edition Application.

Consumer makes payment for the product or 

service using Fiat Currency (ex. $USD) or Crypto 

currency (Bitcoin, Ether or BBI).

If the payment is made using a credit card in Fiat 

Currency, the merchant can decide to use BBI

tokens in order to receive an Instant Merchant 

Deposit* instead of having to wait the traditional

two working days for the settlement to occur. 

If the payment is made using cryptocurrency, the 

settlement process is initiated and the payment 

to the merchant in the form of the respective 

cryptocurrency is transferred instantly.

Loyalty points are accumulated for consumers 

on every purchase of a product and service. 

Loyalty points for merchants are accumulated on 

every sale of a product and service.

Loyalty points can be redeemed when the 

consumer or merchant collect enough points.

Loyalty points are redeemed in the form Fiat 

currencies or BELUGA’s BBI crypto currency or

other cryptocurrency.

The ratio of points with currencies is calculated 

using built-in con�gurators and Oracles based  

on the market dynamics.

BBI Gas for Merchant Deposit Advances

BBI GAS is introduced in the BELUGA ecosystem to

provide merchants an attractive and very much needed

option to speed up the �nancial settlement process

after a successful sale is made with credit cards.

Normally when a consumer buys a product or service 

from a merchant on a Saturday or Friday evening using a 

credit or debit card, the merchant will receive 

days, which would be on Wednesday. In the developing world

the payment for the product or service after two business

this lack of access to funds can cripple business growth.

Now, with BELUGA merchants can receive instant merchant  

deposits in order to buy more goods, pay their employees in

order to grow their business without delay.

BBI Architecture Blocks

BELUGA’s solution is a Hybrid Blockchain model where

kept and transferred between addresses at the Public 

Blockchain level.  

BBI’s architecture intends to support hundreds of di�erent

cryptocurrencies to add �exibility to cryptocurrency holders. 

The communication between the private and public 

blockchain is done through REST, JSON or other APIs.

There are large incumbent technology companies that serve as good markets for success but have failed to truly provide 

solutions for merchants in developing countries and solutions for the cryptocurrency market:

At Beluga we believe that the marriage between traditional payment systems and the cryptocurrency market presents a
