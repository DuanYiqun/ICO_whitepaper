The rapid growth of the number and value of cryptocurrency, and a surge

of general interest in blockchain technology opens up new possibilities

in the field of investment.

Inflated estimates of capital, negative profitability and a lack of alternative 

investment opportunities in the current investment environment

are pushing investors to participate in the development of cryptocurrencies 

and business based on blockchain.

A habitual economy inevitably changes. Fiat money (fiat) gradually flows into 

cryptocurrencies in order to invest in projects built on decentralized 

platforms, or for the purpose of speculation, designed to profit from savings.

The colossal popularity of ICO caused the emergence of a huge number

of new cryptocurrencies (over 200 titles in the last year), which are traded 

today with varying degrees of success. Some cryptocurrencies have gained 

the trust of the community, and others fell into the category of scam. 

However, the profitability may be misleading. Therefore, for purchasing 

there is a need of expertise in the field of investment and understanding

of the cryptocurrency market.

Meanwhile every day the number of private investors who don’t have 

enough knowledge of laws and rules of cryptocurrency world, but who want 

to have an access to undervalued digital asset, is rising.

To help such investors comes Fund Platform, where investor will have

a huge choice of trade investment funds with professional managers.

Thanks to Fund Platform a private investor will be protected from unreliable 

investment and a direct deceit of the funds, because blockchain technology 

allows to make a system transparent and crystal clear.

The opening of a fund with a token, website and marketing campaign will 

require a lot of resources. Fund Platform will allow teams of managers

or private traders to create their own full-function crypto fund in short terms 

with the minimum budget.

With a help of Fund Platform managers of the funds and investor will have

an e�ective cooperation with maximum convenience and in short terms.

1. INTRODUCTION

3 / 37



To collect funds for the development and launch of Fund Platform Service 

FUND tokens will be issued on the NEM platform (New Economy Movement).

At the Presale and ICO stages, FUND tokens will be issued at a price of $ 0.1 

per token.  At the Presale stage 50% bonus.

Via a special form on the website , you can purchase tokens fundplatform.io

by contributing BTC, ETH, XEM or other cryptocurrencies at the current rate 

calculated at the time of the transaction.

After the finish of ICO FUND tokens will be added to your personal account, 

and you will be able to withdraw them into any available wallet of NEM 

project and to activate delegated harvesting (mining) for the purpose of 

selling them in the long term or storing, or trading them at the 

cryptocurrency exchanges for fixing a profit.

The release of FUND token at the cryptocurrency exchanges is planned

if the collected amount is at least $ 2 900 000.

In the case the amount of collected funds during ICO is less than

the minimum, all funds will be returned to the owners.

The list of exchanges will be published after the Presale.

Fund Platform is a fintech platform for creating trade and investment 

cryptocurrency funds (hereinafter referred to as CF) on the decentralized, 

convenient and secure service with the possibility of creation of tokens

for each separate fund and tokens inside the fund.

Service is designed for individual traders and investors as well as for groups 

of traders (managers), investors.

Managers will get at their disposal the newest technologies in a simple 

execution and even in more simple usage. And investors will receive a great 

tool for distribution of their own assets between di�erent managers 

represented on the platform, by getting a guarantee of a transparent

and mutual cooperation thanks to NEM platform.  

Traders will get an opportunity to create cryptofunds in personal accounts 

instantly and users – to invest into them without worrying about their own 

investments. 

The project is designed to make the process of creation of CF and investing 

into them fast, simple and transparent. 

As a «single window» system the platform will allow CF to solve all 

infrastructure tasks with «here and now» principle. That favorably 

distinguishes the fund creation on the Fund Platform from independent 

solution development.

2. WHAT IS FUND PLATFORM?

5 / 37

2.1. Opportunities for investors 

A convenient investment interface will allow to easily meet the challenges
of creation, diversification, structuring and managing of investment 
portfolio.

A wide range of di�erent trade and investment funds, specialized
in investments into cryptocurrency and ICO will be available to you.



For making a competent decision you will have an opportunity to assess

the funds by multiple indicators, such as:

     - a rating from the Fund Platform;

     - capitalization;

     - funds in management; 

     - indicator of risk/return and others.

In just a few minutes you will be able to invest in several di�erent funds

at once, diversifying your funds. At any time, you will also be able to fill up

the portfolio or to withdraw the funds, thereby to fix profit in periods

of uncertainty and volatility.

Positive records of CF with in-depth analysis will allow to allocate the capital 

into attractive assets.  

Among other things, you can exchange one internal tokens (types of shares 

in the field of hedge funds) into others within the same fund, by changing 

investment performance.

6 / 37

2.2. Opportunities for traders and managers 

If you or your team lack the funds to commit more major transactions, our 

platform literally is one of the best decisions.

With the help of simplified and at the same time functional settings you will 

be able to create your own fund with own token in a few minutes, to issue

the internal tokens, that allow investors to o�er di�erent strategies

and investment decisions. And that’s  without spending huge amounts

of money on advertising, audit, ratings, analysis and security of your fund.

Also, without huge expenses for advertising, almost for nothing, you get 

investors, who already cooperate with funds on the platform. And it should 

be noted, that before Fund Platform appearance such solutions

for managers and traders simply didn’t exist on the market. Now it will 

become a reality.



According to fintech analytical company Autonomous NEXT today there are 

more than 300 CF in the world. The cryptocurrency industry has reached 

such indicator just within the last few years. 

As analysts say, the reason for such increase in the number of CFs is a rapid 

growth of the price of many cryptocurrencies. So, in 2016 Bitcoin has grown 

by almost 1000%, the growth of Ethereum over the same period has exceed 

3300%. At the same time the ICO market became hot, where since

the beginning of 2017 projects collected in total more than $1.8 billion.

The number of companies that o�er to their clients’ investments

into cryptocurrencies is further evidence of the rapidly growing interest

in this area. 

The opinions of many well-known experts, investors and founders of the CF 

is similar: the future of a transparent, reliable and convenient economy

is increasingly directed towards the cryptocurrency sphere every year.

3. CRYPTOCURRENCY FUNDS

7 / 37

3.1. Market analysis

3.2. General information 

2017 year became important for hedge funds associated with Bitcoin. While 

entering of fiat currencies from various spheres in Bitcoin-industry

is discussed in the community at the same time with pleasure and concern, 

some big players have already entered the market with business

on the Blockchain technology.



The latter has been enthusiastically discussed in the financial sector

since 2009, by attracting a great interest to this industry, thanks to its 

beneficial advantages:

     - decentralized database;

     - value transfer;

     - resistance to the counterfeiting attempts.

With the appearance of Ethereum cryptocurrency so called smart contracts 

became available to a wide range of business-users, usage of which leads

to an increase of the level of decentralization and democratization

of the contractual relationship, resolves the ambiguity in the interpretation 

of treaties and implementing opportunities for cost reduction.

It led to the emergence of many tokenized investment tools, among which 

there are three types:

     - foreign exchange operations;

     - venture investment funds;

     - tokens tied to assets (such as gold, dollar).

New players on the market of financial technologies aim at the 

reorganization of the financial industry. In such environment larger players 

are taking measures to keep up with the technologies and demand

of consumers.

Regulatory authorities in di�erent countries are also ready to accept

the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.  For example, Bitcoin 

currency is accepted in Japan as an instrument of payment, and Swiss tax 

department confirmed that Bitcoin isn’t the object of VAT.

However, it is necessary to make a lot in order to make the tokenization

of such investment instruments a smooth, transparent process with

the relevant legislation.

It is quite possible for Fund Platform to become a bridge that connects

the opposite banks.

CF or in other words tokenized investment funds, – this is the future of 

financial sphere, and they o�er tangible advantages, such as transparency, 

tradability and the ability to reduce costs.

8 / 37



The main investment stream of such funds can be directed to various 

spheres - the decisions providing basicautonomous infrastructure 

forsupranational economy: decentralized computation, storage

and communication, decentralized exchange, investment solutions, 

predictive markets, reports with reference to the assets, cross-chain 

settlement system, identification protocols, and DAO frameworks on smart 

contracts, reputation systems, social networks, etc.

9 / 37

3.3. Rules and strategies  

CF can have di�erent rules and strategies, such as:

Only those currencies and tokens are used, which are based on 

blockchain technology;

Portfolio may be limited to those currencies and tokens that can 

be easily sold at the exchange every day;

Once made the choice of assets, the structure of the portfolio 

can be based on predefined rules. The sensible investor does not 

want to rely too much on individual currency, therefore, 

maximum weight must be defined (25%);

Due to the high risks in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the market 

of altcoins, the share of Bitcoin as the main asset in the portfolio may 

constitute more than 25%.

When the rules of the portfolio structure is established, must be defined

by the rules of rebalancing, since the structure of the funds becomes 

dynamic with daily price movement.

Some currencies can add value and gain weight while others lose. A new 

currency can enter the Fund, etc.

Consequently, it makes sense to do a weekly or monthly rebalancing, during 

which the Fund managers make the necessary operations to change

the structure of the investment Fund in accordance with the predefined 

rules.



We are moving from investments (distribution) of assets (profit)

to investments and distribution of value, blockchain allows to do 

it easily.

Money (fiat) functions as a common measure, i.e. through it the 

cross rate of all the other values (food, energy, goods, etc.)

is determined, in blockchain and crypto these cross rates can be 

easily installed p2p, where each element can be estimated via 

each other, so CF can find new niches in the field of managing 

value in our world.

If the legal nature of tokens as investment tools is quickly fixed, 

possibly, then the market will react and almost completely will 

move from investments into shares to investments into tokens in 

the next 2-3 years.

Already now it have become clear that classic investments funds 

are a thing of the past, and to their place will come funds that 

control the tokenized actives. Their appeal to investors is obvious, 

as the set of available assets will be ten times or a hundred times 

more than in classic. Everything that is possible to tokenize, from 

gold to gaming artifacts, can become a fund asset and be used

in the investment portfolios of decentralized funds.

The possibility to participate in voting within the Fund  Platform.

The possibility of selling tokens in the long term, based on the 
di�erence in rates.



For the increasing of the FUND tokens there are following powerful 

prerequisites:

The project is aimed at the international markets.

The low price of creation of the fund will allow a wide range

of managers to create a fund.

The CF industry is actively growing. Dozens of new ICO projects 

appear daily. Large hedge funds enter the crypto-active market 

or transform into CF. Redistribution of assets of venture funds

is already observed, and this tendency will only intensify. All this 

is a consequence of the fact that CF have many advantages over 

the traditional funds.

The amounts of investments to the crypto funds are significantly 

larger than traditional funds.

In the near future crypto funds most likely will receive a legal 

appreciation of the authorities in many countries. Such 

precedents have already their own place.

And that’s, in turn, will give a new impetus to the growth of a CF 

capitalization.

Fund Platform tokens in the process of development will be 

redeemed.

The company plans to achieve self-su�ciency in 5 months after 

the launch of beta version of the platform.

Redemption of tokens: since the release to the self-su�ciency 

Fund Platform will deposit 30% of the profit to the reserve fund 

for providing an additional liquidity of tokens, and, if necessary,

to redeem them from holders at a price not less than 80 %

of the o�ering price. After redeem they burn, thus increasing

the cost of remaining tokens and their payment in the circulation.

Without own token it is di�cult to develop for project, because it performs 
several important functions, such as internal currency of the service without 
binding to the fiat funds, the simplified exchange of tokens etc., that’s why 
Fund Platform actively cooperates with developers of NEM (New Economy 
Movement) project. 

The release of token FUND will be made on the NEM platform due such 
services, as:

     - multi-currency wallets;

     - apostille;

     - NEM Mosaics;

     - Namespaces.

Technical features of the NEM platform will allow the fund not only to create 
its own tokens, but also to create subtokens, allowing investors to select 
only those tokens, that meet their requirements for profitability and percent 
of risk.

Also funds will be able to create token on the base of platform’s token – 
FUND (Namespace), that significantly reduce the cost of creating the fund.

We chose NEM Platform, because this platform meets the safety 
requirements and complies with the basic of Fund Platform unlike Ethereum 
(example), which would require you to create several smart contracts to 
each fund to satisfy all the functions required to issue a token.  In addition, in 
connection with certain events, other networks were distinguished by a 
certain instability which may lead to significant problems in the work of the 
platform. We believe that this is the determining factor. The opportunity for 
funds to produce their own tokens inside the token platform FUND 
(Namespace) will allow you to create a variety of products for investors 
within each fund.

Besides, were distinguished by a certain instability, which may entail 
significant problems in the platform work. We consider, that this is 
determining factor. 

8. ABOUT TOKENS

24 / 37

8.1. NEM



Issue of tokens of each fund depends on the settings of the income and 
expenses of the fund.

Every time a customer sends bitcoin to the address of the service, and 
Platform Fund reserves the token FUND. Then, the user selects the fund he 
likes and swaps the FUND tokens into tokens of selected fund at the 
exchange rate at the time of the exchange.

The platform user will also be able to sell the token FUND on foreign 
exchanges.

The usual way of investing involves sending cryptocurrency on personal 
investment address available in your personal Cabinet.

After obtaining the investment, the backend runs the function in the Fund 
Platform, counts the number of tokens allocated to the investor, based on 
prices submitted by the investor in the cryptocurrency at the time of 
investing in USD-terms. After that, the backend service activates the 
function of the release of the FUND to issue new tokens to a new investor.

Web-applications, according to the three-level client-server architecture, 
are divided into the following layers:

          Database server

          Fund Platform Core server

          Web client – Fund Platform Client

Blockchain allows to securely store and transfer digital assets without 
intermediaries. Blockchain has the following features to perform these 
functions:

     - storage and transfer of the information: database;

     - user identification: encrypted secure methods of identification;

  - the absence of intermediary: the distribution between the parties,
       decentralization;

     - transparency: free public access for their own users;

     - security: attack resistant to the consensus mechanism.

We will use a blockchain project of peer-to-peer NEM platform that will allow 
to pay exchange messages and to create the assets.
