1. Introduction
A man of the 21st century lives in an insane rhythm and is forced to solve many difficult tasks as fast as 
possible. Not long ago it was impossible to fulfill them, but now, thanks to the development of the Internet and 
cloud technologies, the future becomes our reality.

Today, the most urgent issue is the continuous access to modern resources that will facilitate and accelerate 
solutions of global problems, will allow them to be carried out worldwide and online. The answer to this 
question lies in the cloud computing, which is becoming more and more popular every day.

Cloud computing is a model where all applications and their data are located on a remote server on the 
Internet and the user can access them from an ordinary PC or a tablet. Computers that carry out such 
operations are called a "computing cloud".

There are two main types of a cloud - public and private. Public cloud is intended for free access of a wide 
audience while private is used by one organization that includes several consumers.

1.1. Tendencies and problems of the world cloud
computing market
According to the American consulting firm Gartner in 2016 total expenses of users working “in the cloud” 
reached $209,2 billion, whereas in 2015 the number was $175 billion. Thus, users’ expenses increased by $35 
billion within a year. Considering analysts' forecasts expenses for a cloud are to reach approximately $246,8 
billion in 2017 and will have exceeded $380 billion by 2020.

Such a high demand for these services is caused by an active transition of IT-industry data into cloud. 
Respectively, information technologies increasingly require high-performance resources to solve various tasks 
from artificial intelligence development to gaming, VR or analytics (Big Data analytics).

Today more than 70% of cloud computing market is occupied by leading providers. Amazon Web Services 
takes the lead (around 34％), much smaller share is taken by Microsoft (11%), IBM (8%), Google (5%) and 
others.

* IBM provides computer rental services in a private cloud. Their cost is calculated individually.

New market players cannot offer significantly lower prices, as they develop only software products - add-ins 
for combining of already existing computing resources - and do not have their own hardware.

1.2 Solutions
In order to make the rent of computing capacities as accessible as possible in October 2016 we started 
working on the Boosteroid project.

Our team consists of information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Initially, we were 
involved in assembling computer nodes based on 6/8 NVIDIA graphics cards and Intel Xeon processors, 
which we used to conduct complex calculations in the field of artificial intelligence. To ensure that 
high-performance equipment does not stand idle, we leased it out and were engaged in crypto-currency 
mining. 
 
We gained our experience and found out that due to our own architecture and constant capacity utilization, 
the cost of cloud computing is significantly reduced. Therefore, we will be able to provide the service at a price 
much lower than offered by leading market players. Budget-friendly rent will make Boosteroid available to 
every user of the World Wide Web.

2. What is Boosteroid
BOOSTEROID - is a cloud service platform that provides convenient access to computing power, storages and 
software products.

A cloud computer will allow to process video, create 3D-graphics, play games requiring high computer 
performance or carry out machine learning on any device even on the PC with the lowest performance. The 
only necessary thing is a stable high-speed internet connection.

Boosteroid will also solve the problem of high rent by reducing cloud computing costs. Thank to the lowest 
rent the service will become affordable to every World Wide Web user.

Boosteroid app will provide the opportunity to use our services and select needed amount of computing 
power just in two mouse clicks. It will be possible to pay for the services with BTR tokens as well as USD and 
EUR.

2.1. Boosteroid implementation

Technical implementation of the Boosteroid project consists of software and hardware parts.

Hardware part will include a lot of heterogeneous computing systems, combined into a single high-speed 
infrastructure:

- servers based on modern general-purpose Intel or AMD processors;
- servers, which include NVIDIA or AMD graphics accelerators and graphics cards; 
- servers, which include Intel graphics accelerators;
- high-speed switching equipment.

Server architecture will be based on:

- Intel Xeon E5, E7 v4 or 5 processors;
- AMD EPYC 7000 series processors;
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards;  
- NVIDIA Tesla P100, Tesla V100 and AMD Radeon Instinct graphics accelerators;
- Intel Xeon Phi 7000 series accelerators.

High Performance Computing Cloud Structure



10boosteroid.com

A fault-tolerant, distributed, redundant storage system will be used in the Boosteroid project. Also, block-level 
stores are provided. In addition to the main data stores, a long-term storage with a large amount of memory 
will be built.

10Gb and 100Gb Ethernet switches will be used as communication equipment. They support the operation of 
the system infrastructure, high-speed computing network and data warehouse replication.

Software part will be based on VMware software products, designed for server, storage and network 
virtualization, as well as IT-infrastructure transformation into stable automated computing environment. 

This concept will allow to create many virtual computers within a computing cloud based on Intel Xeon 
processors and graphics accelerators (cards) NVIDIA with minimal capacity losses.

It will be possible to use the service both on PCs and mobile devices as the access to Boosteroid will be 
provided via browser, regardless of the operation system.

We will develop user-friendly interface to provide convenient work in the cloud and ensure quick access to 
Boosteroid services. Users will be able to connect to a cloud computer via VPN and use particular apps, 
models and games.

For casual users cloud computer performance and processing power will be selected automatically 
(considering the required performance of software products that a user needs).

Experienced users will have an opportunity to select the needed  features of their cloud computer on their 
own.

We also plan to develop BooStore application store where it will be possible to buy or download apps for free 
and install them on the cloud computer.

7. Value on the market
Considering the large number of users and limited number of released tokens BTR exchange rate will increase 
and investors will get maximum return and gain profit. 

Every BTR corresponds to a real service - 1 token = 1 hour computing power rent. Currently the lowest cost of 
1 hour cloud computing rent is $6,5, thus the token rate will increase up to more than $6.

Besides, the number of tokens will reduce due to BTR buyback on the exchange that will start after the service 
is launched.



21boosteroid.com

8. Payment (exchange) mechanism description
We will launch our exchange service that will allow to make fast exchange between USD, BTC, ETH and BTR 
without registering and trading on external exchanges. Users will be able to pay with USD, BTC, ETH and BTR 
tokens. 

The exchange service will be integrated into the web interface, where the payment for computing power rent 
will be made.

Exchange rate and payment details will also be displayed there. The exchange rate will be close to that on the 
cryptocurrency exchanges and will update within particular periods of time. There will be a small charge for 
the exchange operations. 

The exchange service will have reserves of USD, BTC, ETH and BTR. Exchange requests will be processed 
immediately. If the reserves of a particular currency end, the exchange service will automatically order it on 
external digital currency exchanges.

The exchange service will be launched on a separate server and connected to external exchanges, traditional 
payment systems and cryptocurrency wallets modules. The service will have a public API to accept exchange 
requests and inform about the current exchange rate and status of reserves.
