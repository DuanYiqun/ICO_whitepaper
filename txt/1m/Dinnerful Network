DINNERFUL NETWORK 

“At Dinnerful we are dedicated to making dinner available  

On block chain”  
  

Company Background  
 

When we as the co-founders of Dinnerful got together to start this company, it was our vision to 

make Dinnerful the share economy example like AirBnb or Uber in the restaurant industry. As 

the first step, we have been successful connecting local restaurants to serve discount price 

monthly dinner plan. We are working hard to bring in private chefs to cater Dinnerful Club 

members through a Dinner Co-op mechanism. Now with block chain technology about to 

revolutionize the banking industry, we have created MealCoinDinnerful (MCD) payment system 

and Dinnerful Network aiming to establish an ecosystem connecting worldwide restaurants and 

diners with MCD Tokens. 

 

Company Overview 

 

DinnerfulNetwork is an order and MealCoinDinnerful (MCD) payment service network 

connecting worldwide restaurants, catering industry and private chefs onto block chain on the 

crypto-market. MealCoinDinnerful token (MCD) is the first Ethereum-based assets that comply 

with the ERC20 token standard using Ethereum smart contract for meal service on 

DinnerfulNetwork. Dinnerful application is the building block and entry point of Dinnerful 

service at the crypto-market. In addition to using MCD token for meal and other future travel & 

lodging services, diners can also trade MCD at secondary markets for liquidity.  

 

Dinnerful.com is founded in 2015 with $250,000 initial seed money from four private 

investors/founders. Dinnerful.com started monthly family dinner plan service in Boston 

Massachusetts in October 2015. Dinnerful is trusted by thousands of loyal customers serving 

over 800,000 entrees to all Boston families. Dinnerful.com became profitable in 1st quarter of 

2017.  

 



12 
 

DinnerfulNetwork owns trademarks of 舌尖微信食堂 and 舌尖微信 won over a year and half 

long trademark battle against China Tencent腾讯 Company which owns WeChat & QQ (popular 

WhatsApp like chat app in China with MealCoinDinnerful (MCD) payment and shopping 

service integration). 

 

At DinnerfulNetwork, we strive to offer the user access to as large as possible a range of 

blockchain meal catering services as well as other future traveling and lodging “real world” 

services at a maximum degree of convenience, while adhering to the highest standards in the 

ecosystem.
