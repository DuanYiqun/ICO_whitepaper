BONPAY SUMMARY
Ideal combination of technological reliability, infrastructural inclusiveness, relevant experience and deep 
financial knowledge makes Bonpay’s operating manner unique. By balancing these key strengths, our 
team is able to undertake flexible and informed decisions in order to provide the highest-quality services 
for clients.

Bonpay: History Of Creation
Whichever bright future is predicted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the availability of universal payment with 
these and many other cryptocurrencies is still out of the question.

Two payment options are the most common – cash and credit cards. It is not likely that soon any 
payment method will become more widespread than a bank card. Just consider this: bank cards are 
accepted for payment by almost all large stores and online-services. In case where payment by credit 
card is impossible, there always remains a cash payment option.

Bonpay team is a group of experienced professionals and crypto enthusiasts whose ultimate goal is 
to promote the use of cryptocurrency, make it simple, fast and secure. Analyzing the situation on the 
market we made a conclusion that long transaction and confirmation time, as well as high exchange 
costs and overall complexity of the processes on the market make it harder to use blockchain assets for 
businesses and individuals.

We are committed to change the situation and remove these obstacles to allow crypto community to 
benefit from the stable and fast work of the system. Bonpay is able to do this by providing a sufficient 
liquidity based on safe interaction between several equal participants and connection of different 
blockchains within one decentralized network. With regard to people’s funds, transparency, fair rates 
and the best value per money are the first principles to comply with. Bonpay builds its work just on that 
concern.

In the nearest future Bonpay will also allow users to safely store, exchange and withdraw numerous 
cryptocurrencies and ERC20 tokens with low fees and reduced processing time. 

Bonpay Wallet will be available in both iOS and Android versions as well as in already live web-version. 
Adding all these options will allow us, as a global blockchain solution, to provide all our users financial 
freedom.

Furthermore, we offer our clients a convenient solution that will seamlessly connect the world of digital 
currency with the world of traditional finance - Bonpay Card. Our users can instantly load their card 
from Bonpay Wallet, make online and offline payments with virtual and plastic cards. Withdrawal from 
Bonpay Card will be available at 30+ million ATMs across the world.

the pioneers of cryptocurrencies card withdrawal, though we have something to offer to our customers.

We won’t make empty claims that we’ll make a revolution in payment processing industry. However, we 
can promise that we will be on the crest of the technology wave, creating a better product while making 
it easier for the users.

PROBLEMATIC ZONE
So far, cryptocurrency market is rather popular as much as it is narrow. It just lacks liquidity (the case, 
when assets on the market are allowed to be bought and sold at stable prices). If liquidity gets lower, it 
affects the market permanence. At the same time, if liquidity is high, it results in more stable market and 
prices as well.

Due to Blockchain and traditional finances combination crypto and fiat currencies are becoming much 
closer and convenient to use daily, bypassing banks operations. High daily transaction turnover makes 
it easy to fulfill conversion between crypto and fiat currencies on demand. 

Often there is a problem of liquidity in the market due to the volatile exchange rates. Nevertheless, this 
issue is overcome by Bonpay liquidity network. Unlike the exchanges which would keep the currency, if 
its turnover volumes are not high, Bonpay will prevent its clients from sharp price movements risk.

Bonpay intends to improve the transparency of the cryptocurrency industry and opens this market to 
masses.

High Expenses On The Transboundary Transactions
Banks could charge you up to 5% in hidden costs when sending money to any bank account abroad. 
Western will charge you up to 10% commission for international transfer abroad. All these systems are 
centralized and take from 1 up to 5 days for your funds to be transferred to the receiver. Banks set their 
own exchange rate to make money off you, but there are 0% fees for transfering funds inside Bonpay 
system. Simply 0% for transfers.

Low Availability Of Financial Services For Unbanked
Another large problem on the market is that numbers of unbanked users are those considered 
‘underserved’ by the traditional banking system. These are people in areas of lower economic 
development who may not have access to bank accounts. Rather than using large amounts of local 
cash to make certain transactions such as for purchasing cars or equipment, they are doing instant 
peer-to-peer crypto transfers using Bonpay service.

Low Level Of Crypto Liquidity On The Market 
Currently there are no services presenting on the market which provide crypto wallet + card solutions. 
There are a lot of claims but in fact the liquidity of blockchain assets is on the low level. So here comes 
Bonpay service crypto wallet + card solution provider with many other options of buying crypto and 
withdrawing it to fiat. Our service will show the market how all issues with crypto withdrawals should be 
resolved.

Bonpay Wallet

Bonpay wallet allows its clients to keep a diverse currency portfolio ideally connected with the wallet 
and card. It also acts as a tool to convert funds and is available on any device. The exchange fee 
depends on the contribution amount to the network aiming to increase and enhance the liquidity base.

Several additional ways were developed by Bonpay to ensure liquidity network:

• holding our own lockup reserve

• liquidity network reserves

These reserves provide the on-demand availability of currency pairs at reasonable rates. When 
the request arises, Bonpay liquidity network automatically picks the best rate to satisfy the inquiry. 
Participating in Bonpay liquidity network allows users to complete cross-network transactions at lower 
rates simply and swiftly. Public engagement in cryptocurrency ecosystem is one of the core approaches 
of Bonpay to implement the instant crypto convertibility access.



page 14 of 18

DLN Implementation

Bonpay team is developing a new-age technology and soon will implement it in its business model. DLN 
will be based on interaction of several smart-contracts that enable liquidity providers, rich individuals as 
well as Bitcoin exchanges, safely cooperate rather than compete and provide their customers increased 
liquidity. Participants don’t need to trust each other as everything is cryptographically protected. Bonpay 
will be one of the equal participants of Decentralised Liquidity Network and the first who invests in it.

Using DLN helps to separate risks of holding money in one or even several exchanges, it gives you 
confidence in stable and fast work of the system as any unpredicted catastrophe can’t influence all 
participants at the same time. Moreover, involvement of numerous different providers opens new 
horizons to convert more cryptocurrencies to each other and fiat as easy and fast as to send a 
message.

Bonpay Cards

Bonpay Сard is an ideal solution to withdraw funds for cryptocurrencies exchange traders, miners, 
Internet marketers, webmasters and freelancers. It can be used easily and quickly regardless of 
geographical and banking boundaries.

their choice and make transfers safely and instantly to any corner of the world.

ANALYTICS OF THE POTENTIAL GROWTH 
In just several years, the crypto-economy will exceed 10 trillion dollars. Crypto banks will become a 
cornerstone in the relations between decentralized economy and future daily life by expanding payment 
infrastructure and possibilities, creating new cryptocurrency payments scenarios and lowering interest 
rates.

World Analytics And Financial Reports
Financial market growth takes place systematically. According to the data provided by the

Consulting Technology and Outsourcing group Capgemini (https://www.capgemini.com/), the

Global non-cash transaction volumes reached over 700 billions and it almost doubled 2016 year results. 
So imagine that only 5% of these transactions will move from traditional finance to crypto world during 
next year. And we will see the rise of crypto industry.

World internet Penetration Rate (% Pop.) is only 51% so the market could be doubled just because of 
penetrations of the internet technology and its wide-spreading. 

Analytics Of Existing And Potential Customers
We at Bonpay clearly see who are our customers as well as we understand their needs and challenges 
they face. Through the last year the number of crypto enthusiasts has grown up incredibly. And we 
see that the main users of our service are investors in crypto and tokens, those who live overseas and 
are seeking for the cheap methods of transferring funds, migrant workers, business owners, miners, 
unbanked people and freelancers who work with companies and individuals worldwide. Each type of 
the customers can find suitable services from Bonpay. 

Liquidity On Crypto Currency Market
There are several trusted crypto exchange platforms with the options of withdrawing funds to bank 
account as well as buying cryptocurrency, but they mainly focus on the trade and liquidity questions 
more. Also there are lots of local exchanges and services providing different methods of funding and 
withdrawing crypto but their rates usually go higher than 15%, which is not normal. Basically Bonpay 
service with our card solution and lots of methods of funding crypto wallet is the best option for those 
who are only starting their crypto way or already are crypto professionals.
