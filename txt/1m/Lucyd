EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The mind is keen for visual information. “More than 50% of 

the cortex, the surface of the brain, is devoted to processing 

visual information,” according to Professor David Williams 

at the University of Rochester.1 Lucyd is poised to satisfy 

this need, and usher in a new era of visual exploration with 

Lucyd Lens. We believe the knowledgeable team, 

revolutionary technology, and innovative blockchain 

behind Lucyd all contribute to its potential for success. 

Augmented reality (AR) is a live view of a real-world 

environment overlaid with a computer-generated 

interface. Lucyd is launching the LCD token generation 

event to decentralize the AR revolution. We are designing 

next-gen smartglasses that we believe correct many of the 

issues plaguing currently available products, and a 

blockchain app ecosystem to support them. Lucyd Lens 

smartglasses will be designed to evolve your vision, by 

seamlessly merging valuable data with your sight. 

 

We believe Lucyd has a technology advantage in the AR 

space because it has 13 advanced patents and a team of 

optics experts that will allow for the development of a 

uniquely powerful pair of smartglasses. Lucyd Lens will 

seek to be the first that is lightweight, ergonomic, wire-

free, comfortable, accommodates corrective lenses and 

appears like a normal pair of glasses. It will be an 

interactive AR peripheral that can display Android and 

iOS content in AR, while also supporting Lucyd-native 

content. 

Lucyd is launching the LCD token to bring you the glasses 

of the future, and create an organic ecosystem for their 

growth. The goals of the token generation event (TGE) 

are to collect the funding needed to develop a pre-

production prototype of Lucyd Lens, as well as to create 

the Lucyd Lab blockchain. Lucyd Lab will drive 3rd party 

native app development and user engagement with LCD, 

which can be used to purchase AR products from Lucyd.

Lucyd is offering a new token named LCD, which is an 

opportunity to help develop and potentially experience the 

next big thing in AR. This is possible because Lucyd has 13 

synergistic patents and a team of optics and AR experts 

which enable the design of Lucyd Lens, a pair of lightweight 

AR smartglasses. With its powerful IP, Lucyd Lens seeks to 

become the standard in wearable displays, and a functional 

AR ecosystem. 

Acquiring LCD 

To accelerate organic adoption and development of Lucyd 

Lens, we are developing the Lucyd Lab AR blockchain. When 

a 3rd party developer creates new Lucyd-native content, they 

register it with the Lucyd Lab store. This creates a new block 

for that app, which then releases LCD to the developer 

based on the quantity of positive user ratings. This is an 

additional bonus atop traditional app revenue. Community 

users of Lucyd content will also be able to receive LCD for 

actions like ratings and referrals.

INTRODUCING LCD 
TOKEN 

Spending LCD 

LCD tokens may be used to purchase Lucyd hardware 

and native content when available. LCD will also function 

in Lucyd hardware sales. For example, the first 500 units 

of Lucyd Lens will be reserved for purchase via LCD only, 

so owning LCD gives you an opportunity to be among the 

first to wear them. Although actual production costs will 

vary, these beta Lenses will cost 5,000 LCD, and be 

available to token event participants Lens. Assuming a 

successful token event and product, LCD holders will be 

able to sell LCD on token exchanges for other currencies, 

and transfer it in AR. 

Lucyd plans to design developer tools, productivity and 

entertainment apps made natively for its smartglasses, 

available via the Lucyd Lab store in-Lens. Such apps 

would be eligible for purchase via the LCD token. Our 

goal with Lucyd Lab is primarily to support a 3rd party 

developer community. 

UNSOLD TOKENS WILL BE BURNED. WE ARE SEEKING 

TO LIST LCD ON MAJOR EXCHANGES FOR TRADING 

BY THE LUCYD COMMUNITY.

AR smartglasses offer compelling opportunities in industry, 

entertainment, enterprise, training and education, with 

numerous features that increase comfort and productivity. 

The market and momentum have dramatically shifted in 

favor of AR applications.  Mobile games like Pokémon Go™ 

created instant consumer awareness of the power and 

market potential for AR.2 The AR market is forecasted to 

reach approximately $36.4 billion by 2023 according to 

Greenlight Insights.3 North America is slated to be the 

primary market, and is expected to have a CAGR of nearly 

80% by 2020.4   

Consumers may benefit from Lucyd tech advantages, such 

as advanced eye tracking, enhanced field of view,   

prescription lens compatibility, a low-profile form factor and 

a customizable control scheme. If successful, we believe 

Lucyd Lens will have transformative applications in 

commercial, governmental and personal areas.    

AR is a competitive space, and leading companies are 

attempting to create mass market smartglasses, albeit so 

far, unsuccessfully. Other companies have produced AR 

displays that are bulky and/or expensive, limiting their mass 

appeal. At Lucyd, we think our nimble, capable team allows 

us to move in the space with less friction. 

OVERVIEW OF 
AUGMENTED REALITY 

We believe a feature-rich AR device at a reasonable price 

point will become a compelling purchase similar to 

smartphones, with a potentially significant market 

impact.   

Our proprietary IP, if commercialized as we intend, will 

enable users to interact in new and exciting ways with the 

world around them, and personalize the way they see the 

world.  Lucyd Lens will empower individuals by enhancing 

their sensory experience, and transform how companies 

operate across the globe. Lucyd wants to bring the 

handsfree computing dream into reality. 

The improved optics design made possible by Lucyd's 

patent portfolio creates the opportunity to perform in-

lens purchases, for the first time, of apps, media and 

smartglasses. The LCD token will facilitate these 

purchases. 

 

 

 

 

 

“We are high on AR for the long run. We think there 

are great things for customers and a great commercial 

opportunity… It will be huge.” 

—Tim Cook, CEO Apple Inc.5   

 

“AR is no longer just a marketing ploy. We will see 

continued uptake of AR and, as it grows,  

its application will be accelerated by technological 

progress.” 

—DHL Logistics, Report on AR6

LUCYD TECHNOLOGY 
OVERVIEW 
Introduction 

AR is so potentially disruptive because it’s going to improve 
how we interact with information, the environment and the 
Internet—making it seamless, transparent and more 
efficient. Rather than staring into a screen, Lucyd seeks to 
project a tablet-like interface in front of you, reducing eye 
strain and poor posture. For the first time, everyone will be

experience your favorite apps in AR. 
6. Integrated microphone and bone-conducting 

speakers for easy calling and voice control.  
7. Can be connected to Bluetooth peripherals such as 

speakers and keyboards. 
8. Integrated front camera for photo/video capture. 
9. Navigate handsfree with custom controls among eye 

tracking, voice control, and finger tracking input 
options. 

10. A large field of view for HD AR graphics. 
 
Please note: actual features in Lucyd Lens may vary

patents, exclusively licensed from the University of Central 

Florida. We believe these patents combine to potentially 

make the Lucyd dream a reality. With smartglasses sales 

expected to exceed that of smartphones in 2025,7 now is 

the time to get involved with AR.  

Our proprietary technology has the chance to bring AR 

mainstream, because it enables an easy-to-use, 

decentralized AR platform supporting scalable content 

creation. 

Since Lucyd tech was invented at a leading optics 

research center, a significant amount of impartial 

research went into their development. The intellectual 
property behind Lucyd is the foundation for developing 

our pre-production prototype, and we are seeking 

funding to complete it with the LCD TGE. Purchasing LCD 

tokens not only helps develop the AR space, it is an 

opportunity to be among the first to own Lucyd Lens 

smartglasses when available. 

Our exclusive licenses to these patents are for the life of the IP, which extends to 2022-2028 depending upon the individual 

patent expiration dates.

MARKET OVERVIEW 
Introduction 
 

Several aspects of Lucyd position it to potentially be the 
next big thing in AR. A lack of ergonomic AR products from 
the competition, our proprietary university-developed 
intellectual property, and our leading optics and AR 
software experts, we believe combine to give Lucyd a 
competitive advantage in the AR market. This section 
contains key points on how Lucyd differs from existing AR 
systems, and how we believe that Lucyd tech can become 
the best in the space. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greenlight Insights forecasts the world AR market at $36.4b 
by 2023.      

Industry challenges for AR glasses 

There are several problems with current AR products—
bulky form factor, limited field of view, low resolution, 
latency issues, light leakage, poor eye tracking, 
connectivity issues, inability to perform complex 
applications, high cost, high eye strain, incompatibility with 
corrective lenses, inability to detect real object parameters, 
and battery issues. 

How Lucyd will potentially address these challenges 

 Enhanced field of view 

 High resolution (less than 2 arc minute). 

 Compact assembly, arrays and optics allow for entire 

system to be housed in a normal-looking pair of glasses. 

 

 

 Optical microdisplays are faster than external lenses 

similar to those found in several other devices 

(reflective spatial light modulation). Very fast refresh 

rates. 

 Advanced eye tracking capabilities. 

 Attractive spectacles design versus currently 

available bulky AR devices. 

 Zonal estimation for regular and irregular sized 

pupils. 

 Should be able to mirror existing mobile platforms in 

AR. 

 Virtual objects can occlude real objects and vice-

versa, reducing dissonant visuals. 

 Freeform optics for high depth display. 

 

Stage of Development 

The IP is ready for prototype design and development. 
However, there is work to be done. The prototype optics 
design needs to be finalized. Most of the materials 
required for device fabrication are commercially 
available, but need to be integrated and extensively 
tested. The prototype will need to be industrially 
designed to help ensure a sleek look. Furthermore, code 
needs to be written for AR control support for existing 
iOS/Android apps to optimize their interfaces for Lucyd. 
Ultimately, a family of native apps will be developed by 
third parties to take advantage of the full functionality of 
the AR device. To this end we are seeking to execute 
strategic alliance with leading AR app developers. 

Lucyd features that we believe will be ahead of the 
competition 

 Lucyd AR IP embodies technologies that enable 
development of next-gen smartglasses that should 
overcome the optical issues and light leakage 
prevalent in current products. 

 Lucyd AR IP utilizes a novel freeform optics design 
methodology to optimize key parameters like EFV 
and resolution necessary for different application 
requirements, while matching the light 
guide/microdisplay interface. 

 Lucyd AR IP enables lightweight, stylish eyewear 
that should look and feel like normal glasses, in 
contrast to most of the bulky products currently 
available.  

 Lucyd AR IP enables the integration of eye tracking 

for gaze detection.

STRATEGIC BUSINESS 
INITIATIVES FOR LUCYD 
Once a successful prototype is developed and tested, we 
will engage external partners for the manufacture and 
distribution of the smartglasses. App development will 
initially be conducted by Lucyd in-house for basic utility 
apps such as navigation and shopping. We will also develop 
app development kits to support participation by the global 
app development community. We anticipate that Lucyd 
content will be downloaded in-Lens via the Lucyd Lab store, 
housed in the Lucyd smartphone companion app. Our goal 
is to make it easy for everyone to create, share and 
experience Lucyd-native content, entirely in our 
smartglasses. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To enhance global market penetration in a compressed 
time-frame, we will seek to engage with strategic partners 
from among first-tier smart phone and peripheral device 
manufacturers as either suppliers, manufactures or 
resellers of Lucyd Lens.  
 
Lucyd has already secured strategic alliances with four AR 
software and app development companies. Lucyd is 
partnering with these firms to deliver their high-quality AR 
content and developer tools on initial releases of Lucyd 
Lens hardware. These partnerships will help Lucyd deliver 
highly capable, revolutionary smartglasses. You can read 
more about Lucyd’s AR software partners on their websites: 
 
ROAR 
INDE 
Credencys 
Gravity Jack 
Kagiso 
 

Lucyd will seek to generate revenue from these sources: 

1. Sales of smartglasses 

2. Sales of apps 

3. Licensing our proprietary technology to third party 
manufacturers.  

4. Collecting network fees on transfers and 
purchases using the LCD token. 

We view the market for Lucyd lens glasses and apps to be 
global and map onto the current market for smartphone 
sales led by China, Emerging APCA, U.S., and Middle-East 
& Africa. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To achieve these goals, Lucyd will require additional 
investment, most likely from strategic partners or venture 
investors. Our objective is to first produce the pre-
production prototype by Q1 2019 and then seek strategic 
investors to accelerate our growth. We estimate first 
commercial smartglasses and apps will be available by Q4 
2019. Please note, as with any early stage product, actual 
timelines may vary.

LCD TOKEN 
ISSUANCE DETAILS 

Functionality of LCD tokens 

The LCD native token serves these key purposes: 

1. LCD is intended to serve as a native payment system 
for purchasing Lucyd hardware and software when 
they are available. This includes the smartglasses 
themselves, as well as native content that will be built 
for the Lucyd Lab store by Lucyd and 3rd party 
developers. 

2. To fund development of a pre-production prototype of 
Lucyd Lens AR smartglasses and critical firmware via a 
TGE. For a projection of funding allocation, please see 
“Funding Distribution & Auditing.” 

3. To raise funds for the long-term development of the 
Lucyd Lab blockchain, including apps and further 
product improvements. 

4. To organically motivate app development and user 
engagement with LCD token rewards. 

5. As a tool for Lucyd-run promotions, such as our launch 
promotion of offering the first 500 pairs of Lucyd Lens 
for LCD holders only. 

6. To enable instant P2P transactions and transfers in the 
Lucyd community. This potentially allows for a 
completely new, untethered experience, independent 
from existing networks.  

 
The Lucyd token is an ERC20 compatible token, built on the 
Ethereum blockchain for wide compatibility with existing 
wallets, exchanges, smart contracts and other financial 
infrastructure. Our innovative token applications are 
among the first integrations of an Ethereum token in a 
hardware device. See “Introducing LCD Token” for more. 

LCD and blockchain 

We are creating an AR-based cryptocurrency. With LCD 
tokens, purchasers can help develop and experience AR. 
Lucyd is developing an AR blockchain ecosystem and app 
store called Lucyd Lab, which will automatically drive 
native app creation and peer review of Lucyd content. 

In the short term, Lucyd will function as an extension of 
existing smartphone ecosystems—processing power and 
data signal will come from the user’s smartphone, and 
the main interface will be an AR-optimized mirror of a 
phone. However, ultimately we envision the Lucyd Lab 
blockchain as an entirely native app ecosystem, where 
you will be able to develop and download content solely 
via Lucyd Lens. In this stage of the technology, Lucyd Lab 
will act as a decentralized app & media store and 
developer environment. This will free Lucyd developers 
from the heavy fees levied on them by existing 
ecosystems, and potentially rewarding them for their 
efforts with LCD, in addition to whatever profits they see 
from in-app purchases, subscriptions and the like.

LAUNCH SUMMARY 
LCD Exchange Rate  

Users will be able to purchase Lucyd products and 
services using LCD. The value of LCD Tokens, and how 
much LCD will be required to purchase a Lucyd product 
or service, will change dynamically based on the floating 
exchange value of LCD. An average exchange rate value 
will be calculated periodically and used to price Lucyd 
goods and services for its users. 

Potential Future Revenue Streams 

In the development phase, all costs will be fully paid by 
Lucyd. In the production phase, product sales, app sales 
and licensing may provide opportunities for additional 
revenue. A portion of this revenue will be reinvested back 
into product development of Lucyd Lens.  

As consumers become aware of Lucyd through our 
marketing campaigns, network effects should increase 
accessibility to markets, and result in further revenue 
growth from product and app sales. Our marketing 
efforts will focus on expanding the Lucyd brand and 
increasing revenue from our offerings. 
 

Projected Token Distribution 

Of 100,000,000 LCD, 50% will be distributed to the 
community in a public token event, Lucyd will retain 30% 
for long-term development including blockchain (locked 
for six months from TGE end), 10% will be provided to 
early team members (locked for one year after TGE end), 
and 10% will be distributed over time to vendors and 
Token Generation Event supporters.

Crowdfunding Terms 

LCD is a token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Its design follows widely-adopted token implementation standards. 
This allows token holders to easily store and manage their LCD tokens using existing solutions including Myetherwallet. 

LCD project crowdfunding and LCD token creation will take place using Ethereum smart contracts. Participants willing to 
support the LCD project development will send funds via the LCD wallet at https://lcd.lucyd.co/. Token event participants 
will be able to send funds only after the start of the crowdfunding period. Crowdfunding will finish when the specified end 
block is created, or when the funding cap is reached. 

The LCD Token Generation Event will proceed through the native LCD application using an Ethereum smart contract. 

No token minting will be done after the crowdfunding period. At the end of the token event, LCD token creation will be 
closed permanently. All unissued tokens will be burned.

FREQUENTLY ASKED 

QUESTIONS 
What is the LCD token?  

The LCD token is a digital token based on the Ethereum 
blockchain technology. Users possessing LCD tokens can 
exchange them for physical goods and services described in 
this document, and they are planned to have key 
functionality in the AR ecosystem we are developing. 

What do LCD tokens represent?  

LCD is an Ethereum-based token, used in the Lucyd Lab 
blockchain as described in this document. They are not 
refundable, nor are they securities or meant for speculation. 
There is no promise of future performance. There is no 
suggestion or promise that LCD have or will hold a 
particular value. LCD tokens give no rights and do not 
represent participation in the company. LCD tokens are 
sold as a functional good. Any value received by Lucyd may 
be spent without conditions. The LCD Token Generation 
Event is meant only for experts in cryptographic tokens and 
blockchain-based software systems. There is no guarantee 
that LCD tokens or Lucyd’s business activities will be 
successful and have any long-term value whatsoever. 

What amount is being raised? Will there be a follow-on 
offering?  

Our goal is $10 million USD, with a soft cap of $1.5 million 
USD, and a total of 100 million LCD tokens will be created. 
We do not plan to have a follow-on offering, but will secure 
additional funding through alternative means if necessary. 

What cryptocurrencies are accepted during the token 
generation event? 

Every major cryptocurrency, as well as cash, is accepted via 
the LCD wallet.  

Will the Lucyd team have access to LCD? 

10% of LCD is earmarked for the original team, but will be 

locked for 12 months following the end of the Token 

Generation Event. 

 

When will the TGE take place? 

The LCD TGE will run from October 31, 2017-February 
28th, 2018.  

What is the price of LCD?  

LCD will be sold at a fixed ratio to USD ($.25). The price 
of LCD at the time of the pre-sale and sale will determine 
the initial exchange rate, and will be set immediately 
before deploying the smart contract. 

How will Lucyd use the proceeds raised? 

The funds received in the TGE will be used by Lucyd to 
develop initial, pre-production and production prototype 
AR smartglasses, and development of the Lucyd Lab AR 
blockchain, as well as further product improvement. 

Which white paper is considered the “final version”? 

The latest version of this Whitepaper when the crowdsale 

starts, posted on lucyd.co, will be considered the final 

version. All prior versions and translations into other 

languages are for informational purposes only. TGE 

participants should be familiar with this Lucyd 
Whitepaper (4.9) before purchasing LCD. 



        28 
 

 
                                         

 

 
  

Will Lucyd adhere to the plan described in the 
whitepaper following the TGE? 

Lucyd intends to follow through as described in this 
document. However, changes to the process can happen 
due to multiple factors and unforeseen circumstances, such 
as regulatory environment, technology and business 
climate changes, and Lucyd retains the right to deviate 
from the original plan in order to succeed. 

 
How are you building complete AR smartglasses with 
just a $10m funding goal? 
 
The purpose of the Lucyd token generation event is to raise 
just what is needed to create a pre-production hardware 
prototype, as well as the firmware needed for compatibility 
with iOS and Android platforms. To secure additional 
funding needed to create a production product, Lucyd 
intends to engage strategic partners. 
 
How are you fitting all of this in a normal-looking pair of 
glasses? 
 
Lucyd Lens does little to no processing on its own right—it 
is built as an interactive display that runs on your 
smartphone’s computing power. This keeps the Lens 
lightweight, comfortable and unnoticeable.  
 
Who will use Lucyd Lens? 
 
Although anybody could benefit from our AR device, 
research shows that commercial applications will be the 
largest sector of growth for smartglasses. Any company 
that could benefit from its employees having real-time, 
handsfree web access is a potential customer for Lucyd, as 
well as individuals that want the same capabilities.  

 

 

 

What is Lucyd’s competitive advantage? 

Our patent portfolio covers several core technology areas in 
the Lucyd Lens product, which will be more advanced than 
currently available AR displays: 

1. Incorporates a novel optical see-through HMD using a 
light-guide based on phase conjugate mirror 
nanotechnology. 

2. Enables development of next-generation of 
smartglasses that will overcome issues such as stray 
light leakage and optical aberrations that are prevalent 
in current products. 

3. Utilizes a unique free-form optics design methodology 
to optimize key optical parameters necessary for 
different application requirements and matching the 
light guide/micro-display interface. 

4. Enables lightweight, stylish eyewear that looks and 
feels like regular eyeglasses, compared to most of the 
bulky products currently available.  

5. Integrates eye tracking for gaze detection, together 
with enabling effective real/virtual object occlusion 
vital for realistic and spatially accurate AR applications.  

Furthermore, the unique freeform optical system behind 
Lucyd Lens has the following key advantages: 

1. Enables optimization of EFV, pupil size, resolution and 
depth of field. 

2. Enables non-rotationally symmetric, off axis designs 
required for various applications. 

3. Enables minimization of field distortion (blur/warping

Thanks for reading. We hope you  
join the AR revolution with Lucyd! 

 


	Introduction
	AR is so potentially disruptive because it’s going to improve how we interact with information, the environment and the Internet—making it seamless, transparent and more efficient. Rather than staring into a screen, Lucyd seeks to project a tablet-lik...
	Stage of Development
	Lucyd features that we believe will be ahead of the competition
	Introduction (1)
	Several aspects of Lucyd position it to potentially be the next big thing in AR. A lack of ergonomic AR products from the competition, our proprietary university-developed intellectual property, and our leading optics and AR software experts, we belie...
	Industry challenges for AR glasses
	There are several problems with current AR products—bulky form factor, limited field of view, low resolution, latency issues, light leakage, poor eye tracking, connectivity issues, inability to perform complex applications, high cost, high eye strain,...
	Once a successful prototype is developed and tested, we will engage external partners for the manufacture and distribution of the smartglasses. App development will initially be conducted by Lucyd in-house for basic utility apps such as navigation and...
	Lucyd will seek to generate revenue from these sources:
	1. Sales of smartglasses
	2. Sales of apps
	3. Licensing our proprietary technology to third party manufacturers.
	We view the market for Lucyd lens glasses and apps to be global and map onto the current market for smartphone sales led by China, Emerging APCA, U.S., and Middle-East & Africa.
	The LCD native token serves these key purposes:
	1. LCD is intended to serve as a native payment system for purchasing Lucyd hardware and software when they are available. This includes the smartglasses themselves, as well as native content that will be built for the Lucyd Lab store by Lucyd and 3rd...
	2. To fund development of a pre-production prototype of Lucyd Lens AR smartglasses and critical firmware via a TGE. For a projection of funding allocation, please see “Funding Distribution & Auditing.”
	3. To raise funds for the long-term development of the Lucyd Lab blockchain, including apps and further product improvements.
	4. To organically motivate app development and user engagement with LCD token rewards.
	5. As a tool for Lucyd-run promotions, such as our launch promotion of offering the first 500 pairs of Lucyd Lens for LCD holders only.
	6. To enable instant P2P transactions and transfers in the Lucyd community. This potentially allows for a completely new, untethered experience, independent from existing networks.
	The Lucyd token is an ERC20 compatible token, built on the Ethereum blockchain for wide compatibility with existing wallets, exchanges, smart contracts and other financial infrastructure. Our innovative token applications are among the first integrati...
	LCD and blockchain
	We are creating an AR-based cryptocurrency. With LCD tokens, purchasers can help develop and experience AR. Lucyd is developing an AR blockchain ecosystem and app store called Lucyd Lab, which will automatically drive native app creation and peer revi...
	In the short term, Lucyd will function as an extension of existing smartphone ecosystems—processing power and data signal will come from the user’s smartphone, and the main interface will be an AR-optimized mirror of a phone. However, ultimately we en...
	LCD Exchange Rate
	Users will be able to purchase Lucyd products and services using LCD. The value of LCD Tokens, and how much LCD will be required to purchase a Lucyd product or service, will change dynamically based on the floating exchange value of LCD. An average ex...
	Potential Future Revenue Streams
	In the development phase, all costs will be fully paid by Lucyd. In the production phase, product sales, app sales and licensing may provide opportunities for additional revenue. A portion of this revenue will be reinvested back into product developme...
	Projected Token Distribution
	Of 100,000,000 LCD, 50% will be distributed to the community in a public token event, Lucyd will retain 30% for long-term development including blockchain (locked for six months from TGE end), 10% will be provided to early team members (locked for one...
	Crowdfunding Terms
	LCD is a token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Its design follows widely-adopted token implementation standards. This allows token holders to easily store and manage their LCD tokens using existing solutions including Myetherwallet.
	LCD project crowdfunding and LCD token creation will take place using Ethereum smart contracts. Participants willing to support the LCD project development will send funds via the LCD wallet at https://lcd.lucyd.co/. Token event participants will be a...
	The LCD Token Generation Event will proceed through the native LCD application using an Ethereum smart contract.
	No token minting will be done after the crowdfunding period. At the end of the token event, LCD token creation will be closed permanently. All unissued tokens will be burned.
	There is one objective we are focused on achieving—the successful development and international launch of Lucyd Lens smartglasses.
	Lucyd’s main objective through this process is to raise the capital necessary to develop prototype smartglasses based on the company’s advanced AR IP. The ultimate goal for Lucyd is to make and sell smartglasses and the apps that power them.
	Lucyd will use all funding received to support ongoing development and growth of Lucyd Lens and Lucyd Lab. The funding will be used for hardware prototype development, software development, initial production, team salaries and working capital.
	What is the LCD token?
	The LCD token is a digital token based on the Ethereum blockchain technology. Users possessing LCD tokens can exchange them for physical goods and services described in this document, and they are planned to have key functionality in the AR ecosystem ...
	What do LCD tokens represent?
	LCD is an Ethereum-based token, used in the Lucyd Lab blockchain as described in this document. They are not refundable, nor are they securities or meant for speculation. There is no promise of future performance. There is no suggestion or promise tha...
	What amount is being raised? Will there be a follow-on offering?
	Our goal is $10 million USD, with a soft cap of $1.5 million USD, and a total of 100 million LCD tokens will be created. We do not plan to have a follow-on offering, but will secure additional funding through alternative means if necessary.
	What cryptocurrencies are accepted during the token generation event?
	Every major cryptocurrency, as well as cash, is accepted via the LCD wallet.
	When will the TGE take place?
	The LCD TGE will run from October 31, 2017-February 28th, 2018.
	What is the price of LCD?
	LCD will be sold at a fixed ratio to USD ($.25). The price of LCD at the time of the pre-sale and sale will determine the initial exchange rate, and will be set immediately before deploying the smart contract.
