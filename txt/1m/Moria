Gold mines produce billions of dollars in revenue and have provided attractive 
investment opportunities for centuries. The use 
of an Initial Coin Offering or ICO provides a new 
vehicle for investors (large and small) to combine 
the benefits of cryptocurrency with access to 
revenues from precious metals extraction such 
as gold mining. This whitepaper will lay out how 
investors can participate in the Bates Hunter Mine 
mining operations through purchase of crypto-
currency - a purchase which combines the world’s 
oldest and newest systems of value. The aim of 
this project is to raise funds by tokenizing royalties 
in the Bates Hunter Gold Mine and utilizing those 
royalties to pay token holders quarterly dividends, 
thereby creating a token which has inherent and 
trading value.

The use of an ICO not only allows investment in 
an area previously only reserved for those highly 

affluent investors with personal connection to the 
fundraiser, and thus make it more accessible, but 
the structure of an ICO is such that the subsequent 
exchange or transfer of their investment is both 
simpler, and has more transparent pricing and a 
deeper global market. Today, investing in gold 
requires an investment in either bullion or gold 
mining operations through the purchase of gold 
mining stock or the mineral itself. The Moria Coin 
Offering will produce an investment vehicle that 
not only allows for an investment in gold without 
the necessity to buy and store bullion, but is itself 
a distinct Coin investment with significant profit 
potential.

This paper discusses blockchain based ICOs as 
an investment vehicle, the underlying technology 
of an ICO, the details of the ICO and the token 
distribution mechanism, and other considerations.

The purpose of this whitepaper is twofold. First, 
to introduce the notion of an ICO to investors, and 
second, to delve into the use of ICOs and a means 
to enable any investor to participate in precious 
metals extraction.

This whitepaper discusses Moria, the 
world’s first dividend paying decentralized 
investment platform targeting the field of 
precious metals extraction.



Gold was first discovered in Colorado in 1858.  By 1859 over one hundred thousand people 
were heading west hoping to strike it rich. One of 
those people was a fellow named John H. Gregory. 
He is credited with the discovery of the “Gregory 
Lode” in a gulch near what is now Central City. That 
gulch came to be known as “the richest square mile 
on earth.” The Bates Hunter Mine takes its name 
from the Bates vein that is part of the Gregory 
Lode.

Since 1859, official tax records show that the Central 
City district has produced over four million ounces 
of gold, of which Bates Hunter produced seven 
hundred and fifty thousand ounces (these are tax 
reporting figures.) The Bates Hunter closed in 
1936 after President Roosevelt declared ownership 
of monetary gold to be illegal and ordered all 
Americans to turn in their gold in exchange for 
$20.67 an ounce. The prohibition remained until 
1974 when President Ford legalized gold ownership. 
That year gold reached $183 an ounce. At the date 
of this paper, gold was trading at $1,283 an ounce.

The Bates Hunter Gold Mine extends over 35 
acres of ground cover and consists of a series of 
proven gold veins. The operation is fully permitted, 
holding a section 110(2) permit for mining and 
milling operations and includes an EPA approved 
water treatment facility. Expert analysis of the 
mine shows a potential for approximately 154,000 
ounces of recoverable gold to the 300- foot level 
and significantly more below that. There is an 
approximate eight-hundred-foot shaft in place, 
and most of it has never had gold extraction. 
Other area mines have extended recovery to 
2200 feet. Reports of the Bates Hunter mine 
indicate substantial gold reserves at lower depths. 
Current reporting and vein mapping put the future 
reasonably expected value (just to 2000 feet) at 
over $2 billion, with potentially billions more at 

greater depths. The mine is currently served by 
infrastructure that would cost approximately $40 
million dollars to replicate today. It has an elevator 
system that can service the entire “main” shaft of 
approximately 800 feet. It has its own mill that can 
service the tons of “rock” that will be removed and 
processed to be sent to a smelter. It has an EPA 
water purification system.

The current mine operation will have average 
labor costs of approximately $100 an hour per 
miner. Production per miner is anticipated to be an 
average of 1.5 ounces of ore per hour per miner, 
with the amount of gold increasing at greater 
depths. At full production and the mine fully 
staffed, the production rate may be 300 ounces 
of gold every day. This translates to a potential 
revenue of over $120,000,000 per year. As the 
mine is further exploited and richer veins expanded 
this revenue is expected to increase. Overall, the 
expected EBITA for this type of mine should exceed 
75% of gross.

An ICO is a new form of fundraising that has become increasingly popular since May of 
2016. The whole point of the ICO is to democratize 
the investment process while lowering risk to 
investors in ways that were not possible for early 
stage projects. In order to conduct an ICO, a digital 
coin or token on top of a blockchain* is created. 
This coin is typically correlated to the growth of a 
company or product. After the coin is created, this 
coin or token is offered for sale in an initial offering.

The token can be purchased by anyone in the 
world and, upon expiration of any relevant holding 
period, trades on secondary markets in a peer to 
peer fashion. This gives investors from countries 
anywhere in the world the ability to take part in 
early-stage ventures while fostering liquid markets 
for investors to be able to trade with one another. 
The secondary market tradability means that, in 
many cases, investors are no longer locked into 
an early-stage investment until there is an exit, 
but instead can sell any percentage off into the 

market at any time, lowering the risk to investors. 
Even where there are initial lock-ups and holding 
periods, the peer-to-peer, global marketplace for 
tokens makes them superior to traditional offerings 
in terms of transparency, liquidity, ease of transfer, 
and price discovery.

*The concept of a blockchain was initially conceived as

the security infrastructure behind bitcoin. A blockchain

securely ensures transparency and immutability of

transactions on a public ledger by creating linearly

cryptographically chained blocks of transactions. By

having an immutable, secure and transparent ledger

of data and value, the need to trust third parties for a

transaction is diminished or completely removed. While

blockchains have many use cases, in the case of ICOs,

blockchains act as the security infrastructure that enables

billions of dollars to be stored and transacted in a peer to

peer fashion safely.

WHAT IS AN ICO?



ICOs have been around since 2013, with Mastercoin 
as the first ICO in August of 2013 (LINK). While the 
initial ICO, originally called a “Token Crowdsale”, 
was developed on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, 
ICOs only became a commonly used financial 
instrument in 2016 with the emergence of the 
ERC20 Token standard on top of the Ethereum 
blockchain. Since the beginning of 2017, about 
$2.3 billion have been invested into ICOs. ICO 
tokens are built upon cryptocurrency technology, 
like Bitcoin and Ether, and are themselves 
cryptocurrency.

The concept of a cryptocurrency was first 
developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the 
creator of Bitcoin. The idea was a reaction to the 
2008 financial crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to 
create a new form of digital currency that would 
give users control of their own money and enable 
users to conduct commerce in a peer to peer 
fashion without any intermediaries. Bitcoin has  
since grown to almost a $100bn market cap.  

The concept of a peer to peer cryptocurrency and 
the technology behind it have built the foundations 
for new financial innovations, such as decentralized 
applications and peer to peer tokens.

The entire cryptocurrency market sits at $170 
billion USD as of October 20th, 2017. The largest 
ICO raised to date has been IPFS at $257M (LINK). 
Ethereum is the most valuable platform to have an 
ICO, growing from approximately $0.3 per ether 
to over $300 per ether from August 8 2014 until 
October 20, 2017 (LINK).

This Token has the unique quality of paying 
dividends to Token holders. The Moria token takes 
some of the best attributes of crypto-currency and 
corporate bonds, combining them to give investors 
opportunities for gain in the Tokens themselves as 
well as an income generated from the gold mining 
revenue. Token holders (both ICO and subsequent 
purchasers) will receive pro- rata quarterly 
payments equal to 10% of the Company’s previous 
year’s annual revenue capped at an amount which 
equals 20% of the ICO price per Token. Payments 
will be made quarterly. Notwithstanding such 
payment structure, for the 18 months following the 
ICO, all token holders will receive quarterly 
payments. Payments shall be set at 20% of the ICO 
price regardless of any revenue at the Mine and

 shall be made from either funds raised as a result 
of the ICO or general company funds. All payouts 
will be made in Ether. Company management 
holding Tokens will not receive a payout (or will 
return payouts if made) unless and until all token 
holders receive their 20% each year.

Commencing with the ICO closing, quarterly 
payments shall be made pursuant to a schedule 
established at or about the time of the closing.
Management is comfortable committing to this
obligation because the payout of twenty percent is 
only ten percent or less of the projected
minimum gross revenue of approximately $100 
million USD.

which have the potential to increase in value. The Moria token is a securities token offered under onshore 
and offshore exemptions from U.S. registration requirements. For the initial sale, U.S. accredited investors 
and all non-U.S. investors, subject to their local laws, will be eligible for participation in the Moria token sale. 
Investors may be required to provide additional proof       of residency or other qualifications prior to or following 
their purchase of the Moria token.

ensure the highest success of the ICO and the 
mining operations:

DISTRIBUTION OF TOKENS

Quarterly revenue payouts are perpetual subject 
to the Company’s Option Call. The Call allows the 
Company, subject to the timing set out below, to 
buy back some or all of outstanding tokens at a 
price equal to the fair market value of MOR at the 
time of the Call, which amount shall be no greater 
than thirty-five (35) times the ICO offering price. 
The Company, has the right to exercise this Call 
any time after an amount equal to one hundred 
and forty percent (140%) of the price per Token set 
at the ICO has been paid out, but no sooner than 
seven (7) years from the date of the ICO closing.

*Fair market value shall be defined as the average price

at which the coins are traded for one full week prior to

the Call, plus all unpaid accrued revenue payouts.

GS Mining Company, LLC will work with blockchain 
veteran developers, Inwage, to develop an 
application for the Moria Token. The goal of the 
application is to help investors store their tokens, 
receive token payouts and receive communications 
from the company. The application will have the 
following functionality:

• MOR wallet functionality

•  Quarterly/Yearly Updates from GS Mining
Company, LLC

• MOR Price Tracking

•  Additional data and communication regarding
Investor Relations Revenue Payout Claims

• Executable Option Call

To claim revenue payouts 
or to receive a payout at an 
exercise the option call, the 
user must hold coins in the 
Moria application.

The Company will have no 
ownership of coins held 
inside of the Moria app. Instead, the coins will 
be stored by the user. The wallet software will be 
based on secure, open source software. *

*Disclosure: There are risks associated with holding your 

own coins. For example, managing access to your wallet 

is important to ensure unauthorized users cannot access 

your coins. These will be discussed below in the Security 

appendix.

MORIA APP



The Company shall own and control both the 
Bates Hunter Mine and the “Golden Gilpin Mill”. 
The Mill can accommodate 15 tons a day in 
simple gravitation methods. Ore is hand sorted 
underground to levels of 20 ounces per ton or 
more. This allows recovery at the mill of upwards of 
300 ounces per day.

The current work plan is a low-tech activity. One 
miner working on a vein averages the removal of 
1.5 ounces of ore per hour. At current prices that 
means the Miner is generating more than $1800 an 
hour against a labor and benefit cost of less than 
$100 per hour. At full production, with the Mine 
fully staffed, the Mill can produce 300 ounces of 
gold a day, thirty days a month, twelve months a 
year – resulting in revenue of $121,000,000 million a 

year with less than 30% in total estimated costs and 
overhead. As digging proceeds to lower levels in 
the mine and additional richer veins are exploited, 
the Gilpin Mill maybe be expanded or replaced so 
that yearly production can ramp up to greater levels 
which are estimated to exceed annual revenues of 
$200,000,000.

It should be noted that the existing equipment at 
the mine, including the lifts, are fully permitted, 
still comply with applicable regulations and need 
only their own “tune-ups” to be brought back into 
operation and or compliance. Total equipment 
on site at the Mine and Mill and well as initial site 
work, including an approximate 800-foot main 
shaft have total replacement values estimated at 
approximately $30 - $40 million.

The Moria ICO is an opportunity for investors around the world to participate in the Company’s revenue generation at the Bates Hunter mine through ownership of Tokens, 
which have the potential to increase in value.  
The Moria token is a securities token offered under onshore and offshore exemptions from U.S. 
registration requirements. For the initial sale, U.S. accredited investors and all non-U.S. investors, 
subject to their local laws, will be eligible for participation in the Moria token sale. Investors may 
be required to provide additional proof of residency or other qualifications prior to or following 
their purchase of the Moria token.

PRODUCTION ESTIMATES



The eight-hundred-foot mine shaft needs to 
be dewatered to exploit its complete range. 
Management has developed a budget of over $20 
million for the entire project. Nevertheless, it has 
an opening interim plan that rather than drain all 
the water, mining will commence by draining to the 
150-foot level. At that point there is already the 
beginning of a tunnel that runs toward a small shaft 
(the main shaft is “Bates” and the smaller one to the 
left on a side cut view is the “German”). When the 
tunnel between Bates and German is completed, 
the mine will obtain a second safety entrance 
and egress while at the same time stock piling a 
quantity of gold bearing rock.

Estimates are that this process will remove 1500 
tons of rock and at that level gold can be expected 
to be present at an average of 2 ounces per ton 
with an 80% recovery rate resulting in 2400 ounces 
of gold. At a price of $1,250 per ounce the gross 
revenue should be $2,700,000 - $3,000,000.

While this first level tunnel is being worked, 
management intends to begin draining toward the 
300-foot level. Between 150 and 300 feet the real 
value of the mine begins to show. Prior testing of 
this level included eight horizontal drills to remove 
core samples from different spots. Each one of 
those samples were positive leading to a calculation 
that there was literally a wall of gold in this range 
comprising an “inferred” amount of 144,000 
ounces. At $1250 an ounce that is a gross potential 
recovery of $180,000,000.

This substantial recovery is at the 300-foot level. 
Based upon technical studies, drilling samples, and 
a history of the area, it is highly probable that the 
veins will become richer as more water is drained 
and deeper levels below 300 feet mined.

The expenses required to reach the results 
discussed above relative to the 150-foot level are 
relatively easy to quantify.

Pro-Forma Balance Sheet (unaudited and estimated)



ICOs use blockchain technology in fundamentally 
the same way as Bitcoin. If we think of ICOs and 
Bitcoins as simply data that must be secured for 
integrity or immutability, i.e., to prevent and detect 
any modification of the data, then we realize this is 
no different than many other standard applications 
with the same requirement. Whether you are 
supporting a simple web page or running online 
banking you no doubt desire that only authorized 
changes are allow to the data being processed and 
the underlying systems and applications. Likewise, 
when implementing blockchain technologies we 
only want authorized changes to the systems and 
data they process.

From a security standpoint blockchain relies 
upon the inherent security found in cryptography 
and specifically in the asymmetric public key 
cryptography upon which it is based. Cryptography 
is the science that provides the means for secure 
communications. A primary feature of cryptography 
is that it provides both data confidentiality and 
integrity. Asymmetric cryptographic systems or 
protocols are well understood and have been 
evaluated and found to be reliably secure for many 
financial and other types of transactions, e.g., 
simple PIN based debit card transactions or online 

shopping using HTTPS. Thus, ICOs using blockchain 
technology can be considered secure and provide 
both confidentiality and integrity, when using a 
properly implemented cryptographic protocol.

Operationally, ICO security is derived from 
the decentralized nature of the blockchain. By 
maintaining copies of the electronic ledger upon 
which the blockchain uses, one can verify any 
entry at any time and ensure the integrity of all 
transactions. This is referred to as consensus 
security since everyone participating must agree 
with each entry of the blockchain. With a consensus, 
one gains trust which is the core of any secure 
system and certainly those that must be relied upon 
such as ICOs and Bitcoins. This decentralization 
ensures that an attacker cannot corrupt a single 
source of the transaction, as could potentially 
happen with a more traditional non- blockchain 
based systems. Through decentralization we gain 
transparency and auditability of all transactions, and 
thus integrity and immutability.

Appendix A: Risk Considerations 
for Moria Security Token ICO

Blockchain and ICO Security

Watching the news and seeing hackers attempt to disrupt almost anything on the Internet, it is no surprise that security is a major consideration for businesses, system developers 
and investors. The purpose of security is to ensure the confidentiality of data and the integrity of 
operations, and enable confidence in those systems we use to deliver ICOs. Here we delve into 
some of the details for how security is integrated into the Moria ICO. First security incorporated 
into the underlying blockchain technology is discussed and then the security architecture upon 
which that technology is implemented.

I .  TECHNOLOGY & SECURITY PROCEDURES



Ethereum is a blockchain network sometimes 
referred to as an ecosystem. The most common 
aspect of Ethereum is the ERC20 token standard. 
Standards provide greater interoperability and 
are typically well vetted and thus enable strong 
security and integrity. The standard provides the 
common rules for the issuance of cryptographic 
tokens used for smart contracts and ICOs. As a 
standard Ethereum relies upon the security of the 

application code and system upon which it runs. 
For this reason, a strong security architecture and 
operational security are critical. For example, if a 
developer created a poor or flawed implementation 
of the standard in their application one would rely 
upon strong operational security procedures such 
as quality assurance and change control to identify 
those flawed before they could be deployed.

Keeping the smart contract simple and following 
industry best practices on Ethereum with  
ERC20 token is very prudent. As noted below in  
the discussion on security architecture, smart 
contracts are simply data that must be secured.  
By implementing a strong security architecture with 

appropriate operational controls, one can secure 
their smart contract. The security controls for 
smart contract apply to wherever they exist; within 
a wallet, transiting a network, and processed or 
stored within an application.

An Ethereum wallet is used to store and manage 
tokens. As with a physical wallet that one uses to 
hold their everyday cash an Ethereum wallet must 
be secured. In the virtual world this requires taking 
certain precautions. All blockchain based systems 
rely upon cryptographic systems and cryptographic 
keys to functions. The cryptographic keys are 
unique to every individual and must be secured for 
both confidentiality and integrity. If you lose your 
keys or for whatever reason cannot access them, 
then you cannot access the tokens held by your 
wallet. This means that wherever a wallet exists, 
there should be controls implemented such as, 
physical access controls, an authentication and 
access control process and a means to securely 
store the cryptographic keys. In short, the wallet 
must exist within its own secure environment that 

implements a security architecture as described 
below.

This present an issue for all users. Namely, selecting 
a wallet or more specifically, an Ethereum wallet 
client. There are several choices and each of these 
has advantages and disadvantages. For example, 
one can rely upon others such as the exchange 
to hold their wallet, but this means trusting the 
exchange while losing some level of control over 
their wallet and the keys within it. Likewise, one 
can maintain their wallet on their local system. 
This provides a greater level of control over their 
wallet but if one is not technically savvy and loses 
or corrupts the wallet, they then could lose their 
tokens.

Whether ICOs or Bitcoins the reliance on blockchain 
requires that all processing be performed within 
the secure confines of a security architecture. This 
is to ensure that all data and processing resources 
such as coins, cryptographic keys, user passwords, 
application code and system configuration 
information are generated, processed and stored 
in a secure manner, in all locations including the 
wallet, ICO application, all systems, storage devices 
and networks.

A security architecture is simply the implementation 
of hardware, software and operational security 
controls working in conjunction. Components of a 
security architecture includes hardened operating 
systems, identity and access management, network 
firewalls, anti-virus, threat detection, cryptographic 
and similar functions. These are implemented in a 
coherent and mutually supportive fashion such that 
the notion of defense in depth is realized. Using a 
defense in depth strategy for security is considered 
the industry standard and is intended to cost 
effectively reduce potential risks. For this reason, 
the ICO system is built upon a high grade and 
industry standard security architecture.

The ICO application and its web interface, 
when built upon a secure architecture and using 
strong operational security will itself provide a 
secure platform for token creation, distribution 
and management. This is important to prevent 
misdirection of tokens such as has occurred in some 
attacks as noted below.

Regardless if one is running a blockchain based 
application or a more traditional legacy system, 
there is an imperative that a security architecture 
be implemented. Here is but one example of 
the necessity for a secure infrastructure; secure 
cryptography and key management. In a blockchain 
application as in a traditional PIN based credit card 

system, the cryptographic operations performed 
to verify a transaction should be carried out 
within a tamper resistant security module or 
TRSM. This is to ensure the confidentiality and 
integrity of all data processed within it. A TRSM 
is also referred to as a Hardware Security Module 
or HSM and is considered the industry standard 
for performing sensitive functions such verifying 
blockchain transactions. In conjunction with a 
TRSM a comprehensive key management process 
should be implemented. This is to ensure that 
the cryptographic keys used to generate and 
verify transactions are free from disclosure or 
modification. Note that a secure coin wallet should 
have similar characteristics as a TRSM in that one’s 
unique cryptographic keys are store in their wallet 
and thus require strong security controls.

To summarize, a blockchain based system 
must be implemented within a comprehensive 
security architecture. The architecture should 
be implemented on a secure hardware platform 
which itself is physically secured. The TRSM noted 
above is considered part of the secure hardware 
infrastructure. That hardware should then run a 
secure operating system (and any virtualization 
manager) that is hardened and minimized and 
implements a least privilege model for access to 
administrative functions. Additionally, the actual 
blockchain application is secured by identity and

access management controls to ensure the 
application runs as designed and only authorized 
changes to it are allowed.

With the ICO system using strong cryptography 
and implemented on an industry standard security 
architecture, we can reduce the likelihood of 
hacker attacks and safeguard the data representing 
everyone’s investments.

Blockchain based technologies such as an ICO 
are extremely secure. The technologies are very 
mature and have been well vetted over time. 
Discussing hacking and attacks against blockchain 
technologies is important as we can always learn 
something from how an adversary might possibly 
attempt an attack. Understanding an adversary’s 
motives and techniques enables us to build more 
secure systems. Here we discuss some of the 
attacks that have been made against ICOs (or 
rather company’s websites). The critical point here 
is that with a well design security architecture as a 
foundation and solid operational security practices 
in place, attacks and their repercussions can be 
eliminated or minimized.

For example, a recent attack on Enigma highlights 
this (http://www.enigma.co). Enigma was planning 
an ICO when their website was hacked. Because 
of lax operational security (what appeared to be 
poor password account management and a lack 
of multifactor authentication) attackers we able 
to redirect almost $500,000 worth of Ether coins. 
Note that the attack was not again the underlying 
blockchain technology or even the Enigma ICO; 
rather, potential investors were scammed of the 
Ether coins.

Another example was CoinDash. Like Enigma, 
CoinDash had their website hacked and attackers 
were able to misdirect $7 million in cyber currency. 
The attackers basically tricked users by modifying 
the Ethereum address for the ICO so funds went 
to their own wallets instead of CoinDash’s. Note as 
with Enigma, the underlying ICO technology was 
not compromised. Rather, it appears basic security 
hygiene was not implemented, and this allowed 
attackers to corrupt CoinDash’s website.

One last attack should be mentioned. The Parity 
wallet hack. This hack is important to understand 
as it was an attack that took advantage of a 
vulnerability in the program or code of the Parity 
wallet. A vulnerability is an inherent flaw in software 
and the attackers exploited that flaw. Essentially 
a bug in the code. As this was an unknown flaw 
it was considered a zero-day attack. In the Parity 
hack, over 150,000 ETH were misdirected or stolen. 
What the Parity hack demonstrates is that wallet 
and system providers must have strong quality 
assurance testing and controls over their code. That 
is, the code should be well vetted and reviewed to 
ensure that vulnerabilities can be discovered before 
the code is released.

To keep investors informed of the status of 
the mining operations, the Company will 
provide reasonable reporting concerning 
milestones and an annual report of revenue 
to Token holders of record. Updates, reports 
and communications from management will 
be available via the Moria application.

Transparency



The Company’s revenues will have derived primarily 
from the sale of gold. As a result, the Company’s 
earnings will be directly related to the prices of this 
precious metal. Gold prices fluctuate widely and are 
affected by numerous factors including:

• expectations for inflation; 
• speculative activities; 
• relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar; 
• global and regional demand and production; 
• political and economic conditions; and 
• production costs in major producing regions.

These factors are beyond the Company’s control 
and are impossible to predict. If the market prices 
for gold falls below the costs to produce it for 
a sustained period, the Company may have to 
discontinue its exploration, development or mining 
operations.

The Company’s operations will be dependent to  
a large extent on its ability to develop and remove 
ore at the mine. Before it can begin a development 
project, the Company must first determine  
whether it is economically feasible to do so.  
This determination will be based on estimates  
of several factors, including:

• reserves; 
• expected recovery rates of metals from the ore; 
• facility and equipment costs; 
• capital and operating costs of a development 
project; 
• future metals prices; 
• comparable facility and equipment costs; and 
• anticipated climate conditions.

The Company’s business will be subject to a 
number of risks and hazards including:

• environmental hazards; 
• political and country risks; 
• industrial accidents; 
• labor disputes; 
• unusual or unexpected geologic formations; 
• cave-ins; 
• explosive rock failures; and 
• flooding and periodic interruptions due to 
inclement or hazardous weather conditions.

Such risks could result in:

• damage to or destruction of  
mineral properties or producing facilities; 
• personal injury; 
• environmental damage; 
• delays in mining; 
• monetary losses; and 
• legal liability.

For some of these risks, the Company plans to 
maintain insurance to protect against losses at 
levels consistent with industry practice. However, 
the Company may not be able to maintain this 
insurance, particularly if there is a significant 
increase in the cost of premiums. Insurance 
against environmental risks may generally be 
either unavailable or too expensive, in which case 
the Company would not maintain environmental 
insurance. To the extent the Company is subject 
to environmental liabilities, it would have to pay 
for these liabilities. Moreover, in the event that 
the Company is unable to fully pay for the cost 
of remedying an environmental problem, the 
Company might be required to suspend operations 
or enter into other interim compliance measures.

Although at the date of this Memorandum the 
Mine is permitted by the State of Colorado, those 
permits will need to be maintained and regularly 
extended or upgraded to comply with changing 
regulations. Obtaining the necessary government 
permits is a complex and time- consuming process 
involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving 
public hearings and costly undertakings. The 
duration and success of efforts to obtain permits 
will be contingent upon many variables not within 
the Company’s control. Obtaining environmental 
protection permits, including the approval of 
reclamation plans, may increase costs and cause 

delays depending on the nature of the activity to 
be permitted and the interpretation of applicable 
requirements implemented by the permitting 
authority. There can be no assurance that all 
necessary permits

will be obtained and, if obtained, that the costs 
involved will not exceed those previously estimated. 
It is possible that the costs and delays associated 
with the compliance with such standards and 
regulations could become so significant that the 
Company would not proceed with the development 
or operation of a mine or mines.

The company’s operations may be adversely af fec ted by 
r isks and hazards associated with the mining industry.

The company wi l l  be required to obtain  
government permits to conduc t mining operations.

The Company’s business is subject to extensive 
federal, state and local laws and regulations 
governing development, production, labor 
standards, occupational health, waste disposal, 
use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, 
mine safety and other matters.

The Company may be required to maintain reserves 
for costs associated with mine closure, reclamation 
of land and other environmental matters. Future 
expenditures related to closure, reclamation and 
environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate 
due to:

• the uncertainties relating to the costs and 
remediation methods that will be required in 
specific situations;

• the possible participation of other potentially 
responsible parties; and

• changing environmental laws, regulations and 
interpretations.

Various laws and permits require that financial 
assurances be in place for certain environmental 
and reclamation obligations and other potential 

liabilities. The amount of the financial assurances 
and the amount required to be set aside as 
collateral for financial assurances are dependent 
upon many factors, including reclamation cost 
estimates. The Company may be unable to maintain 
the financial assurances that may be required.

From time to time, the U.S. Congress considers 
proposed amendments to the General Mining Law 
of 1872, as amended, which governs mining claims 
and related activities on federal lands. Legislation 
previously introduced in Congress would have 
changed the current patent procedures, imposed 
certain royalties on production and enacted new 
reclamation, environmental controls and restoration 
requirements with respect to mining activities on 
federal lands. The extent of any such changes is not 
known and the potential impact on the Company 
because of congressional action is difficult to 
predict. Changes to the General Mining Law, if 
adopted, could adversely affect the Company’s 
ability to economically develop mineral resources 
on federal lands.

The company wi l l  face substantia l  
governmental regulat ion and environmental r isks .

Many U.S. states have either brought enforcement 
actions or introduced legislation regarding 
Cryptocurrency regulation, with widely varied 
approaches and results. New York, California, and 
Texas agencies have all issued opinions, opened 
investigations, or otherwise become involved 
directly in Cryptocurrency Regulation. New York 
adopted a ‘BitLicense regulatory regime in June 
2015, which purports to place requirements and 
restrictions not only on New York residents, but 
anyone worldwide transacting business under 
New York law or with New York counterparties. 
Conversely, Texas has many Cryptocurrency-

related businesses from registration under the 
Texas Money Services Act, albeit with abundant 
exceptions. Arizona has passed legislation 
providing for enforceability of ‘smart contracts’ 
in local courts. The state to state regulatory 
environment is currently extremely fluid. Many 
other states may attempt to institute regulations 
or bring enforcement actions. Similarly, taxation 
and treatment may vary from state to state, as well, 
either now or in the future. These factors could 
negatively impact the value of an investment in the 
Units.

I I I .  ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

Cryptocurrency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation protections. There is substantial uncertainty surrounding 
the current and future regulation of Cryptocurrencies and Token markets.

It may be now, or become in the future, illegal to 
buy, hold, sell, or use bitcoins or other Tokens in 
one or more countries. One or more countries have 
or may in the future adopt, alter, or implement laws 
and regulations which adversely affect the Fund’s 
positions. Because the market for cryptocurrencies 
is global, to the extent this suppresses demand 
or creates distrust, slowing or preventing mass 
commercial and consumer adoption, this could have 
an adverse effect upon the value of an investment 
in the Units.

Individual nations have taken widely different 
approaches to regulating Cryptocurrency Tokens 
and their related markets. These range from 
recognition of bitcoins as legal tender (Japan); 
unpredictable or fragmented regulatory frameworks 

(United States, where regulation has emerged from 
a patchwork of decisions by multiple regulatory 
bodies); simple illegality (Nigeria & Macau have 
banned all banks and other financial institutions 
from engaging in any virtual currency related 
transactions; China has banned all ICO activities 
and ordered the closure of Cryptocurrency 
Exchanges; South Korea has banned all ICOs and 
margin trading of virtual currencies); to simply 
nonexistent, with many countries providing little 
to no guidance as to their regulatory treatment of 
Cryptocurrency – related activities (the EU, which 
takes the position that it cannot comprehensively 
regulate Cryptocurrency markets absent legislative 
or treaty changes).
