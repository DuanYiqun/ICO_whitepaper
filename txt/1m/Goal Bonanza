1 Executive Summary

Goal Bonanza is a self-regulating, blockchain powered football betting platform based on ERC20 token

standard. It offers fresh and new football betting experience by combining lottery like crowd betting on

10 possible football game final score outcomes where the crowd drives the potential returns, unlike

traditional bookmakers and betting exchanges that offer unattractive odds and low returns. The bigger

the crowd the bigger are the potential returns easily reaching six figures. In simple terms, imagine

$100,000+ in returns on 1$ bet by successfully predicting the final score of a football game out of 10

possible outcomes. That is Goal Bonanza and much more.

In addition to the unique game mechanics, Goal Bonanza revolutionary concept taps into basic desires

and needs of users’ impulses which revolve around the idea of profits, status, achievement, competition

and community collaboration. Goal Bonanza applies gamification mechanics to engage and motivate

users to play in order to win rewards, badges and points, that are used to elevate their status and

privileges, and to showcase their talents, expertise, and accomplishments.

Build on ethereum platform and adopting ethereum as the underlying game currency, Goal Bonanza will

significantly contribute to the crypto-community and the ethereum platform by increasing the demand for

ethereum cryptocurrency, increase its value, and induce adoption in the global betting marketplace.

Goal Bonanza doesn’t require the use of fiat currency for playing therefore it is outside gambling

regulatory bodies and jurisdiction and therefore a non-regulated stateless business. Operations fudging

and dividends payouts is performed in convertible ethereum cryptocurrency. In year 3 we expect to

reach a total of 6.34m active players and generate earnings of $74.9 million.

2 Market Overview

Introduction

Sports betting is a very popular 

type of gambling that involves 

predicting sports results and 

placing a wager on the outcome.

It has become the fastest 

growing market segment within 

gambling worldwide, and now 

dominates, accounting for nearly 

half of the total online betting 

market. 

A fifth of sports betting takes 

place via mobile, and this is 

expected to reach 45 per cent by 

2018.

The consolidated global sports 

betting market, both regulated 

and unregulated, is worth up to 

$3-trillion. Around 65 per cent of 

that figure is spent on football 

betting, with the Asian market 

the center of sports gambling.

The Chinese, Indian and 

Southeast Asian markets, where 

betting is largely illegal, have 

been identified as the principal 

operational jurisdictions for 

unregulated bookmakers.

In China, where up to

1$-billion dollars can be gambled 

on a single game of football, the 

ratio of legal bets to illegal bets is 

1:10.

The global licensed and 

regulated gambling market (all 

products including: betting, 

poker, casino, bingo, gaming 

machines and lotteries) is 

forecast to reach $533 billion in 

2017. That is a 47% increase 

from the $363 billion market 

figure in 2007.

The gross gambling yield* 

(GGY) of the licensed and 

regulated global football betting 

market is expected to reach $80 

billion in 2017.

The gross gambling yield (GGY) 

from the global mobile device 

betting market is expected to 

generate an increasing share of 

all interactive gambling reaching 

nearly 44% by 2018 and 

representing around 5% of total 

gambling. This trend is driven by 

growth in smartphone and tablet 

penetration. 

As mobile gambling is 

exponentially growing, the 

average mobile gambling spend 

per adult in the European Union 

(EU) is expected to grow from 

just over $1 in 2010 to over $17 

by 2018.

2 Market Overview

Popular types of football bets

This is by far the most common

type of football bet and is

usually based on the match

result after 90 minutes where

the punter predicts a Win, Draw

or Lose outcome with a total of

three possible outcomes.

Barcelona Real Madrid

Barcelona Win       1     2.10

Real Madrid Win    2     3.30

Draw                       x     3.00

2 : 1

FULL-TIME RESULT (1X2)

Two-way bet regarding whether

the total number of goals scored

will be more than the one

quoted or less. In most cases,

the bet appears to exceed or

even be less than 2.5 goals and

two possible outcomes.

Chelsea Arsenal

Under 2.5 goals            1.75

Over 2.5 goals       1.95

Over 3.5 goals              2.80           

GOALS (UNDER/OVER)

Under these types of football

bets, one has to predict the

correct score within the normal

90 minutes of football action.

The odds tend to be quite high

because of the fact that there

are many possible outcomes.

Inter AC Milan

Correct score 1 : 0         8.50

Correct score 1 : 1         6.50

Correct score 2 : 1         7.50

CORRECT SCORE (CS)

2 : 0 1 : 1

TRADITIONAL BETTING

When betting with a bookmaker you can only bet on

the odds they offer, only having the option to back a

certain outcome. The odds set by bookies include

their margin meaning they price markets in their favor

with unfair odds. Bookmakers effectively make money

by building in a margin/over-round into their odds.

BETTING EXCHANGES

Instead of being limited to the odds set by bookies,

and only having the option to back a certain outcome,

an exchange allows users to go head-to-head against

each other by either backing or laying. It differs to

traditional sportsbooks by allowing bettors to bet

against each other, rather than a bookmaker.

The inspiration behind Goal Bonanza

3 What is Goal Bonanza

Betting on sports makes a game 

you didn’t care about, interesting. 

"Will my prediction come up?" 

"Will my team win?“

The anticipation of winning or 

losing a bet creates a natural high, 

adrenalin rush, a feeling we seek 

when looking for fun and 

entertainment. There's an edge-of-

your-seat rush when you bet on a 

game and it’s in the final seconds 

and the bet is won or lost on a 

single shot, out, or pass.

Why do people like to bet so much 

on football? Well, the first reason 

is because most people love to 

gamble. The second reason why 

people love to bet so much on 

football is because people love 

football. In our modern culture we 

no longer go to war and battle one 

another, so instead we enjoy 

competition through the safer 

medium of sport. 

We all like to pick a favorite team 

so we can get together with fans 

of the same team, celebrating 

when they win or supporting one 

another should they lose. 

Guys like to think they can 

predict the outcome of a football 

game. They like to talk trash to 

each other and that trash talk 

can escalate into a bet. 

Spending a dollar to maybe 

make a million as in buying a 

lottery ticket is one thing but 

when it comes to football betting, 

there is a little more to it.

Today, you cannot bet a dollar 

on a football match to maybe 

make a million bucks.

. 

Traditional bookies and betting 

exchanges don't offer this type of 

excitement and adrenaline rush. 

They simply don’t offer a betting 

model that can generate the 

potential returns of lotteries. 

But what if someone is to invent 

an innovative way of football 

betting where players can win 

unlimited returns, a million or 

more by betting a single dollar. 

A platform with unprecedented  

proposition of unlimited returns 

where players can showcase their 

betting skills and expertise to the 

community, but also win status, 

privileges, rewards and bonuses 

for their engagement and activity.

Can you imagine the excitement 

this kind of game would create in 

a football betting market that lacks 

innovation and a breath of fresh 

air and offers unattractive odds? 

We see an opportunity to innovate 

and disrupt an industry with 

annual turnover of $3-trillion. 

People love to gamble on football 

and we made it our mission to 

make football betting even more 

fun and exciting.

In the table provided above, you can see a matrix

with historical data from all football game scores in

the top 4 English leagues in the last 126 years. In

66.1% of the total games played, neither team

scored more than 2 goals. This accounts for a total

of 9 outcomes. From statistical perspective, in

33.9% of the games played, at least one team

scored 3 or more goals. All though not impossible,

it would be very hard to predict the final game

score out of 49 options. We decided to improve the

odds and simply bundled those 33.9% in “Goal

Bonanza” as the 10th outcome in our model.

In a simple 6-from-49 lottery, a player chooses six

numbers from 1 to 49. If all six numbers on the

player's ticket match those produced in the official

drawing then the player is a jackpot winner. For

such a lottery, the chance of being a winner is 1 in

13,983,816. Our main challenge was to design a

model with a total of 10 available game score

outcomes where there will be at least one winner in

every football game available for betting. From

statistical perspective and in practice, a football

game has significantly more than 10 possible

outcomes as displayed in the table on the right.

3 What is Goal Bonanza

Game mechanics

Goal Bonanza is a lottery game where players predict

the final score of a single football game by backing at

least 1 out of 10 available options. Unlike traditional

bookmakers and betting exchanges that offer

unattractive odds and low returns, in the Goal Bonanza

lottery the size of the pot drives the potential returns.

The bigger the pot is, the bigger the potential returns

are. The bigger the potential returns are, the bigger the

incentive to place a bet for a chance to win big profits.

For example, 80,000 players wager a total of 100,000

tokens worth $1 each, on a single football game. 180

tokens are wagered on 0-0, a scoreless draw. If the

game ends 0-0, the players that wagered those 180

tokens will split the winnings proportionally. Every

winning token generates a return of 555 tokens or $555.

Betting options

Players can also use hedging strategies and bet on more than one outcome to improve their chances.

For example, backing 3 outcomes statistically increases the chance of winning a bet to 30%.

Goal Bonanza is a brand new product that combines lottery mechanics and football betting to unlock

the potential of unlimited returns for players but also requires skills and know how unlike plain lottery.

This is what makes this game a unique proposition in the football betting market.

Real game simulation

Real Madrid is a big favorite hosting Levante in the 3rd round of

Primera Division at Santiago Bernabeu. The average odds for

a home win are 1.10, with 19.00 for an away win and 10.00 for

a draw. Levante is undefeated in the last two games, they are

playing very well and tight at the back, and John believes

Levante might be able to snitch a low scoring draw in Madrid.

The crowd is backing a home win for Real Madrid and most of

the wagers go on “GOAL BONANZA” and home win game

scores. John however, wagers 5 tokens on 0:0, 1:1 and 2:2,

each and hedged his draw prediction with 15 tokens on “GOAL

BONANZA” to cover his losses in case Real Madrid trashes

Levente. On the right you can see the expected distribution of

stakes in a football game with a home team as a huge favorite.

John just made profit of $45,782.85 (Total returns – total stake).

No traditional bookmaker or betting exchange could match this.

If the game ended up with a high scoring home win, John

would get his stakes back by hedging his draw bets with 15

tokens on “GOAL BONANZA” at 2.10 to 1. Real Madrid was a

big favorite in the match and the crowd is heavily backing the

most probable outcome. The potential returns on the less

probable outcomes are exponentially growing and the crowd is

more keen to back an underdog. This behavior on the other

side increases the potential returns for backing a home win that

no traditional bookmaker of betting exchange can match.

5 Why contribute

LICENCING AND COMPLIANCE

Licensing challenges, regulatory repercussions

and compliance requirements. Very strict gaming

regulations and legislation that significantly

varies between countries and governments.

Goal Bonanza is a stateless, non-regulated

cryptocurrency platform that is not subject to any

regulatory or licensing requirements.

UNIQUE CUSTOMER PROPOSITION

Lack of innovation and differentiation as

sportsbooks are using the same ‘off-the-shelf’

solutions provided by monopolized and

regulations heavy marketplace of gaming

providers. Goal Bonanza is brand new gaming

concept offering different football betting

experience unlike anything else on the market.

LACK OF PRIVACY

Identity verification requires substantial

personally identifiable information including form

of identification, credit card and bank account

details. Goal Bonanza provides the ability to play

without any forms of identification. No record of

deposits/withdrawals appearing on a monthly

statement ensuring privacy is respected.

LOW RETURNS

Low returns and unattractive odds set by

bookmakers that effectively balance their books

in a way that allows them to make money

irrespective of the result. Goal Bonanza doesn’t

set the odds and potential returns but the players

do. The bigger the crowd the bigger the returns.

No limits. Period.

Build on ethereum platform and adopting ethereum as the underlying game currency, Goal 

Bonanza will significantly contribute to the crypto-community and the ethereum platform by 

increasing the demand for ethereum cryptocurrency, increase its value, and induce its adoption 

in the global football betting market.
