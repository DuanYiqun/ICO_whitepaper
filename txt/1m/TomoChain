“...Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network 

to govern without a ruler and without money. They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, 

voting systems. The meritorious are those who work to advance the network. As society 

gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the 

network what it wants…”

Ethereum network. TomoChain is a technically innovative and significant component 

that makes TomoCoin and other cryptographic tokens issued on it secure, transparent 

and trustworthy enough to be a store of value as a digital asset. TomoChain will be 

integrated into the Tomo application when the development is completed, and then 

open up to be a separate service to external parties. The current feature plan of 

TomoChain includes:

- Proof of Authority consensus based on Ethereum codebase

- Masternode and servicenode system 

- 2 second confirmation and zero transaction fee for transactions

- Support all Ethereum smart contracts

- API supports for token issuances and integrations

- Zero-fee atomic cross-chain transactions (between Ethereum and TomoChain back

In our opinion, a secure and user-friendly coin wallet that gives financial control back 

to the end-users is one of the most important parts of the infrastructure of the 

“Internet of Value”. It will bridge the gap between a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a 

mainstream user – and possibly increase the adoption rate of cryptocurrency by 

10-fold if done right. Tomo wallet shares the same backend infrastructure of Tomo 

application such as TomoChain, third party APIs, decentralized identity system, coin 

exchange smart contract and APIs etc. The planned feature set of Tomo wallet will be 

as follows:

         he blockchain industry and the infrastructure of the Internet of Value are being 

built rapidly around the globe, and to many the atmosphere is eerily similar to the 

building of the Internet in the late ‘90s, with pioneers and dreamers coming together 

to build a new future. TomoChain and TomoCoin can be a leading part of this 

phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of social and consumer 

applications integrated with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream 

users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture, allowing for fast, 

frictionless payment and a secure, decentralized, and trusted store of value.

 

The Internet of Value is understood as a phase when values and digital assets exist as 

a packet of information on Internet via blockchain technology. These packets of 

information are transparent, secure, programmable, and globally accessible to anyone 

with Internet. Our mission is to be a leading force in building this era, designing its 

infrastructures and working toward a reality that will make knowledge, 

decentralization, financial independence, and opportunities accessible to everyone, 

everywhere. Our goal is to make TomoChain infrastructure powering a host of 

multiple successful decentralized applications and supporting thousands of 

cryptographic tokens from established small and big companies and to make 

TomoCoin one of the most valuable and important digital assets for millions of people.

3. TECHNICAL DISCUSSION

WHITEPAPER TOMOCHAIN 13

Currently, the average confirmation time on the Ethereum blockchain is 17 seconds. 

The number of transactions in the Ethereum blockchain is increasing day by day, from 

38,730 to 102,103 in the first quarter of 2017 – a rise of 163% – and it will continue its 

steady increase, with new applications and users joining the Ethereum ecosystem by 

the minute. The Ethereum blockchain can process around 8.5 transactions per second, 

equivalent to 740,000 transactions per day. There are some significant changes to the 

Ethereum protocol planned in its roadmap, such as a transition from proof-of-work 

distributed consensus to proof-of-stake consensus, which will potentially raise the 

bandwidth further.

 

With a conservative estimate of 50 million active users after the first three years of 

operation, the Tomo application’s goal is to become a first-class, mainstream 

application using  cryptocurrency. This requires, firstly, instantaneous financial 

transactions within the app; secondly, minimal or no-cost financial transactions within 

the app. With that goal in mind, Ethereum mainnet would not be the ideal choice for 

This section discusses some current technical issues behind TomoChain, TomoWallet 

and Tomo application and how they connect with the Ethereum blockchain.

directly hosting all of TomoApp financial transactions given that a single app such as 

the Crypto Kitty app can quickly slow down the whole network after achieving 

popularity. We are designing our TomoChain solution to better satisfy the given 

objectives but also maintain the cryptocurrency characteristics of TomoCoin.

TomoChain is a blockchain infrastructure solution to the scalability problems with 

building TomoApp or other mainstream applications on Ethereum or other blockchain 

technologies in general. TomoChain is a public permissioned blockchain with 

integrated smart contract functionalities (currently based on the Ethereum 

code-base) which allows for nearly zero fee & instant transaction speed with public 

auditability of financial transaction records. TomoChain opts to use Proof of Authority 

and build nodes in multiple locations to make sure the database in a highly secure, 

immutable state. APIs for third parties will also be standardized and published in the 

next phase of development.



TomoApp is a social network with a native cryptocurrency. TomoApp uses 

Microservice architecture to be flexible and extendable. At the storage layer, 

TomoApp uses several type of databases to satisfy requirements from specific 

functionalities.

TomoApp uses noSQL database which operates Master-Slave model to maintain 

high-performance. Sharding techniques are used in both database and application 

layer to ensure a read and write at high speed level. TomoApp uses Cache in multiple 

layers of the system such as Client-side (Mobile Application, Web Browser), 

Webserver, Server-side, Database. Besides reading and writing databases, TomoApp 

deals with natural language processing, ranking algorithm and use Message Queues 

such as Kafka, RabbitMQ to deal with non-concurrent processing. 

Databases, Cache, and Message Queue 

Search is a very important part of TomoApp. We pre-process the data and serve data 

to search databases such as Elasticsearch and Apache Solr. Recommendation services 

connect users and experts to questions and answers they are interested in. TomoApp 

uses natural language processing techniques and Graph databases such as Neo4J to 

deliver suggested content and related topics.

Search and Recommendation



WHITEPAPER TOMOCHAIN 17

We will be using AI for a number of functions within the Tomo application such as: i) 

optimization of personal feed based on public profiles and activities; ii) optimization of 

suggestions of people to follow and content; iii) spam and fraud detection and iv) 

image and video recognition. We commit to only using publicly available information 

in the Tomo application to improve the user experience, while maintaining the privacy 

of any personal and private communications within the network. We take advantage 

of available and powerful tools for AI such as Tensor Flow, Scikit-learn, Inception V3 

etc.

Artificial Intelligence

The Reward Engine will emit coins to users based on the contribution of users to 

the network. TomoCoin will also be used as a mean of payment for all services and 

third-party applications provided. Financial transaction will be hashed and stored in 

blockchain to ensure the security and transparency of the data and to maintain a high 

level of trust. TomoApp works with two chains: the first one is the Ethereum 

blockchain which will be used to issue ERC-20 token and allow users to sell and buy 

tokens via third party exchanges. The second is a side chain (TomoChain) that will host 

all financial transaction within TomoApp. Both the sidechain and the Reward engine 

will interact via our Smart Contracts.

TomoApp will reserve a part of the coin supply for the Reward Engine’s emission over 

the year. The process mimics Bitcoin block rewards in that at a fixed interval, the 

Reward Engine will emit a predetermined amount of coins to Tomo application users 

based on their relative contributions to the application, hence the process is called 

Proof of Contribution. A published algorithm will calculate the relative contributions 

based on the quality of contents in the given period based on factors such as number 

of Likes, number of Comments weighted by the Contributor Score (C-score) of users 

performing such actions. New users in TomoApp will have an equal starting C-score 

and their C-score will increase and accumulate over time based on the relative amount 

of contributions he/ she gives to the network.

Example: The TomoApp has three users A,B,C and the corresponding C-scores are 

X,Y,Z. At the current interval, A contributes 1 answer, B contributes 1 answer and C 

contributes 1 answer to the network. Assuming C’s answer is liked by A and B; B’s 

answer is liked by A; A’s answer is liked by C. The relative calculated contributions of 

A,B and C in the current interval are Z, X and X+Y respectively and the payout in coin 

to A,B and C will be given accordingly. C-scores of A,B,C will also increase by the same 

amount after the current interval. 

We will publish a separate paper on Reward Engine and C-score implementation for 

public viewing and commenting before deploying the solution to the mainnet at a later 

date. AI will later be used to aid in the process to make the Proof of Contribution fair

use the same service. TomoChain development will create a secure and decentralized 

identity service for Tomo network.

Public/ Private key and Passphrase

The TomoWallet allows users to control and use multiple addresses. The addresses 

could be from different blockchains such as TomoChain, Bitcoin, Ethereum. Private 

key will be encrypted with a passphrase and saved in both client and server. The 

process of encrypting and de-encrypting will stay only at the client side. Therefore, no 

one has an access to the private key without the passphrase. If users change devices, 

users will need to use the passphrase to synchronize the data and access to their

TomoWallet has a separate backend following microservice architecture. This 

backend collects data from blockchain for analysis and serves features such as 

Notification, Message, Feed etc. Financial transactions will not go through this 

backend but will go through TomoChain to maintain security and transparency at the 

highest level.

TomoWallet Backend

The TomoWallet allows third parties to use its infrastructure and user’s graph. Third 

parties can use the open source SDK provided by Tomo or to use the standard APIs 

using Restful and Swagger documents. TomoWallet also provides WebHooks at 

multiple levels to the third parties.

TomoWallet and TomoApp use TomoCoin which is issued following ERC-20 standard 

in the Ethereum blockchain. TomoApp and TomoWallet aim to reach the highest level 

of performance for Internet consumer applications which requires very low 

transaction fee and very fast transaction speeds. At the same time, transparency, 

security and value of TomoCoin are of paramount importance to us. TomoChain is our 

solution of using a permissioned public blockchain with integrated smart contract 

functionalities. TomoChain allows for nearly zero fee transaction and and very high 

transaction speed, at the same time supports public auditability of all financial 

transaction records. TomoChain will also interact with Ethereum public blockchain via 

smart contracts allowing for TomoCoin interoperability between Tomo network and 

Ethereum public blockchain. It is planned that TomoChain will also use TomoCoin as a

Proof of Authority

TomoCoin from other third party utilizing TomoChain. A technical paper on 

TomoChain, the governance system and its the economics of TomoX will be published 

when the chain design is completed. The official launch of TomoChain is planned for 

the third quarter of 2018.   

In Proof of Authority (PoA), all node validators are chosen based on collaboration 

between parties. PoA consensus is suitable for an organization who want to build a 

transparent blockchain supporting external auditability but control who can join the 

node network (permissioned public blockchain). TomoChain opts to use PoA and build 

nodes in multiple locations to make sure the database in a highly secure, immutable 

state. In the future, other organizations wants to utilize this architecture can join to be 

a partner and and operator of TomoChain. 

Kovan is an open-source based on Ethereum codebase and developed by Parity. Kovan 

is using PoA, however Parity only allows selective partners to join the network. 

Consequently, Ethereum foundation created Rinkerby Testnet, also using PoA and 

allowing a wider range of partners to join. Tomo plans to use Ethereum-based, POA 

consensus to build a customized TomoChain. This is a good choice given the level of 

maturity in documents, code bases, smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem.

4. MARKET ANALYSIS

       n the paper “A vision of the Internet of Value”, Long Vuong points out there are seven 

dimensions of a new money technology: transparency / anonymity; efficiency; security 

/ counterfeiting risk; accessibility; decentralization / trust independence; 

programmability; and acceptability. TomoCoin can become the cryptocurrency of 

choice for a certain class of end-user if TomoCoin can be the best in its class in a certain 

dimension, or if TomoCoin can accrue a unique combination of characteristics that 

appeals to a subset of end-users. Being the native cryptocurrency to the Tomo 

application, TomoCoin will have unique acceptability characteristics with all the 

third-party apps within the application accepting the coin. Being the protocol token 

for the TomoChain infrastructure, TomoCoin will be needed by all the parties utilising 

TomoChain to build applications or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their 

applications. Research and development is at work on the security and UX of the Tomo 

wallet; and the efficiency, programmability, and security of TomoChain will further 

improve the value of TomoCoin in the future. Here, we will analyze and compare 

TomoCoin with some other cryptocurrencies in the broad crypto-market to illustrate 

the unique position of TomoCoin.

WHITEPAPER TOMOCHAIN 27

Steem cryptocurrency and the Steemit web application setup is similar to TomoCoin 

and the Tomo application in that both platforms’ respective crypto-tokens will be used 

to reward content contributors who produce valuable content for their communities. 

Steem is the native cryptocurrency of Steemit, like TomoCoin is of the Tomo 

application. However, there are many other differences. The Tomo application has 

much better mobile-ready and modern video-sharing features, which makes it highly 

oriented to mainstream users. The plan is to make the Tomo application one of the best 

social knowledge-sharing applications. We have a strong local understanding of Asia 

markets, particularly in Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Korea, and Japan, which will open 

up the latent demand from mainstream users in the region. Steem’s market 

capitalization is about US$550 million at the time of this writing, based on data from 

cryptocurrency market tracker Coin Market Cap.

Kin will be the cryptocurrency of the popular messenger Kik. The idea of Kin is to 

kick-off a digital ecosystem around the messenger app Kik. We share a similar goal in 

grounding TomoCoin in the Tomo network. So the key difference between the two is 

the respective markets where Kik operates – primarily in North America – and Tomo 

application’s main target market, Asia. Furthermore, we are focusing on scalable 

infrastructure TomoChain solution with TomoCoin as the protocol token which is 

closely integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem, meanwhile recently Kin plan to move 

eventually to Stellar coin’s ecosystem. Kin cryptocurrency ICO raised close to 150 

million $, and beside the ICO, Kik messenger has raised venture capital of more than 

US$120 million to date.

assets. It is based on the OmiseGo blockchain and closely integrated with the 

Ethereum blockchain. A notable strength of OmiseGo is its ability to work with legacy 

financial institutions and other partners to allow their wallet to be used in physical 

locations in Southeast Asia. OmiseGo is based in Thailand and will potentially compete 

with the Tomo wallet in Southeast Asia. OmiseGo concluded its Initial Coin Offering 

(ICO) recently, and the current market capitalization is around US$1.4 billion.

5. TOMOCOIN CRYPTOCURRENCY

WHITEPAPER TOMOCHAIN 29

A |  General characteristic

TomoCoin is a cryptocurrency of fixed supply, consequently it is long-term and 

non-inflationary. Like other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, units of 

TomoCoin are fractionally divisible, fungible and transferable to other TomoCoin 

holder. TomoCoin will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an 

ERC20 token. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard 

token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, 

such as development tools, multi-signature wallets, ICO contract scripts and 

exchanges. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing 

custom digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts because of its 

Turing-complete language allowing for the writing and deployment of complex 

“...Tokens are a breakthrough in open network design that enable: 1) the creation of open, 

decentralized networks that combine the best architectural properties of open and 

proprietary networks, and 2) new ways to incentivize open network participants, including 

users, developers, investors, and service providers. By enabling the development of new 

open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping 

it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation...” 

Chris Dixon - investor and researcher at A16Z venture - 6/1/2017.



TomoCoin’s price will be determined by the force of market supply and demand. On 

the fundamental level, demand for TomoCoin will be closely related with the 

popularity and usage of Tomo application and TomoChain infrastructure. Later on, this 

demand will also increase with the capability of using TomoCoin for transactions in 

physical locations and the successes of other third party applications in the TomoApp 

and the d-app ecosystem around TomoChain. On the supply side, TomoCoin has a fixed 

supply pre-determined on the issuance day, but only a percentage of the total coin will 

be released initially to the crowdsale participants. The company and advisor’s 

allocation will only be released gradually based on a vesting schedule over several 

years. The rest of the coins will be released over a 8 years period to the network 

contributors via the Reward Engine/ Ecosystem Building program and other 

developer’s partnership program.      

The planned allocation of coin is as follows: 50% of coins going to the crowdsale 

participants; 15% of coins going to the company, advisors and bounties, 35% of coins 

going to the Reward Engine/ Ecosystem Building program and the emission will last 8

years at around 4,5% per year. After 8 years, the initial coin reserve will run out but the 

Reward Engine/ Ecosystem Building program could continue from the network’s 

revenues such as advertising or fees from other services and applications. The 

collective of coin holders could give guidance on the options for the network to move 

forward at this point. The following chart illustrates the TomoCoin yearly inflation rate 

toward a fixed supply after 10 years. 



WHITEPAPER TOMOCHAIN 32

        omoCoin supply is fixed at 100 million tokens. The allocation is as follows: 50 

million is going to the token sale event; 35 million is going to Reward Engine/ 

Ecosystem Building program and will be distributed to users and developers based on 

relative contributions to the network over an 8 year period; 15 million is going to the 

software company which allocates thecoin to team members, advisors and bounties 

over a vesting schedule in a 4 years-period. TomoCoin is important in several 

dimensions to the Tomo network, firstly, TomoCoin will be used as a source of funding 

to complete the development of TomoChain, TomoApp and TomoWallet; secondly, 

TomoCoin being used in the Reward Engine/ Ecosystem Building program as an 

incentive mechanism to build Tomo network  community; thirdly, TomoCoin being 

used as a long term decentralized governance instrument of Tomo network , that 

means we will build tools to gather opinions from coin holders to decide the future 

direction of the Tomo network including TomoChain infrastructure, TomoWallet and 

Tomo application; fourthly, TomoCoin being used as the native payment method 

within Tomo application and other third-party services.  

We have a long-term commitment to complete the product, engineering and 

marketing roadmap for the Tomo network including Tomo application, TomoChain and 

TomoWallet. Consequently, figuring out the resources needed to get the works done 

effectively, we estimate to spend at least one and half million $ per year over 4 year
