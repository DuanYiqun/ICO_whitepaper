1. About DS PLUS 

Mobile marketing becomes a more important part of advertising with every passing 
year: Native mobile marketing platforms that attract and retain clients are being developed 

at a tremendous rate, and new social and 
information technologies are constantly 
being developed. DS PLUS has existed for 
little more than a year and has already 
become a strong player in the mobile 
marketing and lead generation industry. 
The DS Plus platform is built to entice 
people to make purchases and take 
advantage of services offered by sellers 
who are ready to show loyalty to their 
customers. 

We refer to the merchants on the 
DS PLUS system as “partners.” As of the 
current moment, we have 1,496 partners 
and our system is in operation at 8,027 
locations throughout Russia and in parts 
of Europe. These numbers are growing by 
the day (fig. 1: DS PLUS partner 
locations). Our partners include both 
regional companies (such as the 
“Absolut” supermarket chain) and major 
multinational retailers (such as X5 Retail 
Group, McDonald’s, and KFC). 
                  

  fig. 1. DS Plus partner locations (product screenshot)  

 
Users conduct transactions with our partners on a daily basis. Each day, the userbase 

increases by an average of 250 people. When clients make purchases from DS PLUS 
partners using the platform, they receive discounts, as well as unique bonus points that can 
be exchanged for various gadgets, or for other goods and services. Very soon these bonus 
points will become a supported cryptocurrency, and our partners and users will be brought 
together in a common infrastructure. How? We shall answer all your questions in what 
follows! 

 



 

 

 
 
 

 

2. DS PLUS’s mission 

We are creating an independent tool facilitating the distribution of crypto-cashback
1
, 

for use by our partners. 
What is the state of cashback as a tool today? There are several services within the e-

commerce market that successfully facilitate the return of a certain percentage of the 
purchase price when purchases are made from major online retailers. But using these 
services involves a series of operations that are quite complicated for the average 
purchaser, and the latter sometimes has to wait as long as two months before the cashback 
arrives; in addition, the cashback reward must then then be shared with the service that 
provided it. In offline retail, cashback is a prerogative of the banks. Cashback is paid a 
month later, and in the majority of cases the reward amounts to only 1-2% of the purchase 
price. There are, of course, a number of bank partners who pay as much as 15% to the user, 
but this usually involves retailers that do not cause particular interest to the average 
consumer, or else one-off promotions in the form of a large reward for an initial purchase. 

Our goal is to encourage the maximum possible number of users and partners to use 
cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. This will be achieved through the instant payment of 
our cryptocurrency as cashback on purchases from our partners.  To achieve our goal, it is 
not enough just to pay out the cryptocurrency, therefore we are also developing additional 
services based on the Ethereum blockchain, which will support the exchange and sale of 
our cryptocurrency. Together, these services will form an infrastructure that can be used to 
develop the sector as a whole. 

 
We plan to use 50% of the funds raised from the initial distribution of PlusCoin to 

support marketing, which in its turn will ensure a steady growth in the number of partners 
and users together with a smooth but consistent growth in the value of - and demand for - 
PlusCoin. Popularizing PlusCoin will also mean increasing the number of partners that 
accept it as a means of payment for their goods and services. 

 
The immediate tasks to which the DS PLUS team is setting itself include attracting as 

many users as possible to the cryptocurrency, expanding the list of regions where PlusCoin 
is used, and, within each region, extending the list of partners who accept PlusCoin as 
payment for  goods and services. 
 
 
 

                                                 
1 Cashback is a form of loyalty scheme in which a proportion of the purchase price is returned to the buyer. 



 

 

 
 
 

 

3. DS PLUS Token and ICO 

This project calls for crowdfunding investment in the First PlusCoin Token, which is 
based on the Ethereum blockchain platform. 
 
The first stage of the project is the presale of First PlusCoin tokens, which will take place 
between August 4 and August 15: during this period 100,000 tokens will be distributed at a 
price of $5 each. 
 

 
The First PlusCoin token ICO, accepting payment in Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Ethereum, 

DASH, etc. (‘Fundraising (ICO)’), will take place between September 10th and November 
10th, 2017. 
 

1 The First PlusCoin Token is a package containing 3300 PlusCoin (the final token). 
 

In the first phase (20 days, or 3,000,000 Tokens + 400,000 bounty) of the ICO, First PlusCoin 
Tokens will be sold at a price of $10 per token. 
In the second phase (20 days, or 3,000,000 tokens + 300,000 bounty) of the ICO, First 
PlusCoin Tokens will be sold at a price of $11.50 per token. 
In the third phase (the last 22 days, or 3,000,000 tokens + 300,000 bounty) of the ICO, First 
PlusCoin tokens will be sold at a price of $13 per token. 

 
The number of First PlusCoin tokens to be released during the ICO is limited to 

9,000,000 tokens + 1,000,000 bounty. 
  

The bounty, totaling 1,000,000 First PlusCoin Tokens, will be distributed as follows:  
Upon the purchase of First PlusCoin Tokens at the ICO, we shall give tokens as gifts:  

● 100-299 First PlusCoin Tokens: + 2% of the sum acquired;  
● 300-499 First PlusCoin Tokens: + 4% of the sum acquired; 
● 500-699 First PlusCoin Tokens: + 6% of the sum acquired; 
● 700-999 First PlusCoin Tokens: + 8% of the sum acquired; 
● 1000+ First PlusCoin Tokens: + 10% of the sum acquired; 

To reward the word of popularizers of our project, we shall form a fund of 100,000+ First 
PlusCoin tokens (the amount is approximate: this is the lowest possible figure, but the final 
amount will depend on the quantity of First PlusCoin tokens acquired during the ICO). 

 
First PlusCoin tokens will not be generated in the future, and all tokens unsold during 



 

 

 
 
 

 

the ICO will be destroyed. Besides the 10,000,000 tokens to be released during the ICO, DS 
PLUS will also distribute 9,000,000 First PlusCoin tokens (29,700,000,000 PlusCoin) into 
infrastructure circulation. 6,000,000 First PlusCoin tokens will form a reserve fund that will 
also be released into the infrastructure on an emergency basis if there is ever an 
insufficient quantity in circulation. The distribution of all First PlusCoin Tokens is shown in 
fig. 2.

DS Plus does not use services of escrow during the ICO because it offers an already 
well-functioning product to the audience which you can use immediately after getting your 
PlusCoin. 

 

4. The business and financial models: 

Our current model for working with partners: 
Today, the primary concern for DS PLUS operations is the motivation of users to 

make purchases from partners by providing the latter with various benefits that encourage 
loyalty to a brand (discounts, offers, various bonuses). Once PlusCoin is on the market, 
partners will motivate users to buy from them in return for paying PlusCoin into the user’s 
account. At present, PlusCoin bonuses (which are not yet provided and which can be 
exchanged for participation in the raffle of gadgets and an automobile) are paid out by the 
DS PLUS service. The total quantity of PlusCoin held by users as of today is 16,000,000 PLC. 
 
Our future work with partners will take the following form:  

The first stage will be the integration of PlusCoin into traditional markets: First, the 
partner tops up his PlusCoin balance by buying the digital currency using his personal 
account, at the EPPC price (Exchange Price PlusCoin—the PlusCoin’s market price). The 
level of the EPPC is determined by the exchange rate of the PlusCoin at that particular 
moment. The partner then uses his personal account to specify either a fixed sum or a 



 

 

 
 
 

 

percentage of the sale price that he is ready to give the user as a cashback. The total 
quantity of PlusCoin that is paid to the user as a result of the transaction is according to the 
formula: 

         
   

             
 

where A is the volume of the user’s purchase and USD price is the current value of the US 
dollar expressed in the traditional currency in which the purchase takes place.  

PlusCoin may also be distributed when the user visits the partner. The visit can be 
registered by geolocation and with iBeacon sensors installed by partners. 

 
An important aspect of DS PLUS’s operations is the segmentation of its partners into 

three types: 
1. Cold – a partner who is unprepared to take control and pay out PlusCoin independently: 

in this case, DS PLUS or another market lead generator working with PlusCoin takes on 
control over PlusCoin payouts; 

2. Second-order partner – prepared to go over to the new system and independently 
control payments of PlusCoin to users of the service, but not prepared to accept 
payment for goods/services in PlusCoin; 

3. First-order partner - prepared to go to the new system and independently control 
payments of PlusCoin to users of the service, and also prepared to accept payment for 
goods/services in PlusCoin at a rate given by the formula: N * EPPC * price in PlusCoin, 
where N is the partner’s price-increase coefficient. 
 

   For example: if the price of one of the partner’s products is $100, and the EPPC = 
$0.02, meaning that the market price is equal to 5,000 PlusCoin, and if the partner has 
selected a price-increase coefficient of N = 1.6, then the partner can sell the product for the 
PlusCoin equivalent of $160, receiving an additional 60% on the sale. The maximum value 
for the coefficient N is 2; no minimum value is set. A recommended value of N will be 
worked out for each group of goods. In the early stages of integration into traditional 
markets, the price-increase coefficient will have the function of motivating partners to 
accept payment for their goods in PlusCoin. 

A user who has no connection to the crypto community and takes no particular 
interest in the blockchain or cryptocurrencies will be able to spend his accumulated 
PlusCoin in an online store on the DS PLUS platform, in other platforms accepting PlusCoin, 
or with a first-order partner. 

 
The store on the DS PLUS platform will stock products from second-order partners and will 



 

 

 
 
 

 

operate as follows: 
1. The user places an order for a product with the store, and receives a notification that his 

order is being reviewed; 
2. The order is passed to the processing center, then to exchangers or specialized market 

players. One of these players approves the order and sends the traditional currency to 
the partner, receiving the PlusCoin from the user. Different groups of goods will have 
different maximum values for the price-increase coefficient N. 
 

Users who understand the status of PlusCoin will be able to distribute their 
accumulated coins themselves (exchangers, exchange markets, etc.). For convenience, the 
DS PLUS app will offer integrated functionality to aggregate exchangers, and also the ability 
to transfer PlusCoin from one user to another (P2P) using a wallet interface.

5. Products enabling the PlusCoin turnover  

The following products are being developed to enable deeper integration of PlusCoin 
into traditional market relations, and also to ensure the decentralized circulation of crypto 
funds: 

 
1. MarketPlace aggregator: 

For partners who are unwilling or unable to accept PlusCoin as payment for their 
products (second-order partners), we offer the chance to become a participant in the 
system and to earn profit in a traditional currency. We are developing a product for this 
purpose with an open API and transparent principles of operation: The second-order 



 

 

 
 
 

 

partner lists his product using a personal account and indicates its price in traditional 
monetary units; the online system converts the price into PlusCoin with a price-increase 
coefficient N for the given group of products. The platform connects exchangers and 
other specialist players and thereby solves the problem of providing traditional currency 
for the transaction; the exchangers themselves receive a profit through the coefficient N. 
This principle of operation will be offered because of the fact that the majority of 
ordinary users will not entirely understand PlusCoin’s value: They will treat the 
cryptocurrency like a system of bonus points, and exchange it for goods. 

2. P2P platform:  
The moment the amount of PlusCoin, allocated to users by our partner-companies in the 
DS PLUS system, exceeds 1bn, we shall launch a platform permitting user-to-user 
exchange of goods/services for PlusCoin. Unlike traditional P2P platforms, this system 
will include integrated functionality for conducting transactions within the service. It will 
allow users to make secure purchases: the money for a particular good or service will be 
paid only upon its sale, thus reducing the risk of fraud. 

3. Cryptoscoring: 
Based on data gathered from the activity of a particular user with regard to his or her 
transaction history on the platform, the DS PLUS system will be able to form an analytical 
rating of that user relative to other users. This rating can be used as a tool for further 
credit on consumer goods in the PlusCoin currency. 
This will become an additional tool for our first-order partners, exchangers and other 
market participants, making it possible for them to enable transactions both 
independently, and at the preliminary request in the DS PLUS MarketPlace aggregator. 
 
 

6. Force majeure circumstances and risk control 

One of DS PLUS’s most important tasks is to create a decentralized economic 
infrastructure that will ultimately function independently of the DS PLUS platform itself. 

 
The following steps will be taken to achieve this:  
1. To support work with partners who do not accept cryptocurrency in payment, we must 

ensure that conversion is possible between traditional currency and PlusCoin. 
Partnership agreements to this end are already being signed between DS PLUS and 
exchangers, and in the future, we expect to cooperate with other market players, who 
will support the function of the exchangers while specializing exclusively in PlusCoin; 

2. Within the framework of the agreement, exchangers and other specialist players will be 
able to sell PlusCoin at the EPPC (market price per coin) to partners via the DS PLUS-



 

 

 
 
 

 

created platform or using other market mechanisms; 
3. Products that compete with DS PLUS in the traditional market sector will be drawn into a 

single partnership network and will become one of the most important components of 
the infrastructure being developed by DS PLUS. The main objective of the project is to 
embed PlusCoin into real-world circulation of goods and currency, which will ensure a 
steady growth in the exchange rate and will also add to the number of people engaging 
with the crypto economy, both among consumers and among businesses; 

4. The stability of the system. One of the most important factors in the infrastructure we 
are creating is the mutual profitability of all operations that take place within this 
infrastructure. 

 
Let us take a simple case: Partner A acquires PlusCoin and pays 5% of the purchase 

value back to the user. Over the course of a large number of transactions or P2P-platform 
operations the user has accumulated 50,000 PlusCoin. If the user understands the 
significance of the crypto funds he has in his possession, he may make use of the services of 
exchangers or of the exchange market and obtain traditional currency. In case he thinks of 
PlusCoin as a bonus he has built up, he can buy products that interest him directly from 
first-order partners or (via an intermediary in the form of an exchanger or another market 
player) from second-order partners, paying the price-increase coefficient N. 
 
In this case:  
● partner A has received a lead, thanks to the loyalty campaign;  
● the user has obtained the services and/or goods he needs, or has exchanged funds for 

fiat; 
● the first-order partner has acquired PlusCoin at a price lower than the EPPC, thanks to 

the coefficient N, which can then be paid out to users within the framework of the 
loyalty campaign; 

● the second-order partner has obtained a lead and made a sale; 
● the exchanger has made the difference between fiat and the PlusCoin he has obtained, 

thanks to the coefficient N. 
We draw your attention that PlusCoin is a utility token and does not provide ability 

for holders to take part in revenue sharing, is not an asset of the company, and does not 
guarantee any profit for holders if they do not pursue that goal. PlusCoin is created to 
support the processes of the DS Plus product and its partners.  

Despite all our efforts, it is possible that our strategy will be realized only in part or 
not at all. In the case that this occurs, everyone who acquires our First PlusCoin Tokens risks 
losing their investment.

8. Project team 

69 people work for the project, the majority of them are ordinary employees and are 
engaged in scaling the project; they are responsible for interactions with partners. The main 
strategic tasks of the project are divided among seven participants. All staff members 
engaged in management and responsible for the key components of the project are young 
managers with a vast array of competencies and substantial experience in a diverse range 
of fields. The chief advisor to the project is the founder and CEO of the Chronobank project, 
Mr Sergei Sergienko.

10. Technical description and specifications 

The PlusCoin smart contract includes: 
The SafeMath library for protection against overflow during arithmetic operations. 

 
Standard ERC20 functions and events: 
● Returns the total supply of tokens 
   function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply) {}  
● Returns the balance in coins held at a given address 
   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance) {} 
● Sends coins (from the sender’s balance) to a given address 
   function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {} 
● Sends coins from a given address to a given address, if the owner of the address to be 

deducted from has permitted this operation 
   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {}  
● Permits the deduction of a given quantity of coins from a given address from the 

message sender’s account  
   function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {} 
● Returns the total quantity of coins that can be deducted from a given address by another 

address 
   function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint256 remaining) {} 

 
Only the owner of the smart contract can use these functions during the Presale and 

ICO 1-3 stages. 
 

Public variables and constants: 
● name – token name; 
● symbol – token symbol; 
● decimals – number of digits the cryptocurrency has after the decimal point; 
● totalSupply – total supply of coins; 
● PRESALE_PRICE – price fort 1 ether; 
● current_state – current state of the contract; 
● OWNER_MIN_LIMIT – minimum quantity of coins; 
● TOKEN_PRESALE_LIMIT – limit on coin sales during the Presale stage; 
● TOKEN_ICO1_LIMIT –limit on coin sales during the ICO 1 stage; 
● TOKEN_ICO2_LIMIT - limit on coin sales during the ICO 2 stage; 
● TOKEN_ICO3_LIMIT - limit on coin sales during the ICO 3 stage. 
 



 

 

 
 
 

 

Functions for the Presale and ICO stages, etc.: 
● function transferOwnership(address newOwner) onlyOwner {} 

Allows the contract owner to transfer ownership to another party. 
● function buy() public payable {} 

 

Function for coin purchase from the contract owner at a fixed price; active only during the 
Presale and ICO 1-3 stages. 
● function buyTokens(address _buyer) public payable {} 
 

Function for purchasing coins and credit them to a given address. 
● function price() constant returns(uint)  
 

Get the current state of the contract. 
● function setTokenState(State _nextState) public onlyOwner  

 
Change the contract status. Possible statuses: Created, Presale. ICO1, ICO2, ICO3, 

Free trading, Pause. Statuses can only be changed in one direction (from ‘Created’ to ‘Free 
trading’). However, the smart contract owner can halt sales at the Presale stage by putting 
the contract into the ‘Pause’ state. This is necessary to protect against unforeseen 
circumstances. Transition to the Pause state and back is only possible during the Presale 
stage. 

 
● function remaining_for_sale() public constant returns (uint remaining_coins) 

Returns the remaining quantity of coins for sale during the current stage, in accordance 

with the set limit. 

 

 

11. Marketing plan 

Russian Federation:  
At the moment the Russian Federation is the principal market in which DS PLUS 

operates. The service today has 12 franchises throughout the country, each being 
responsible for coordination with regional partners. The strategy for further development 
of DS PLUS and PlusCoin in the RF is as follows: 

 
The target sector of users consists of young, active people with average and above-

average incomes, who are active users of mobile apps but are neophytes in the world of 
cryptocurrencies and the crypto economy. 



 

 

 
 
 

 

Taking into account the macroeconomic specificities of particular regions of the 
Russian Federation relative to the diversity, quantity, and level of partners, it becomes 
obvious that we need to focus on cities with populations of 500,000+. There are 36 such 
cities in Russia. The total population of these cities is 44.6m people. 

According to data provided by Rosstat, the group aged between 25 and 39 (the key 
characteristic of the target sector with regard to age) makes up 22.5% of the population. 
The average unemployment rate is 5.5%. According to research by the Public Opinion 
Foundation, more than 46% of the population in each city earns less than the average 
salary. 

 
Based on this data, the total size of the target sector is 5.12m users. During the marketing 
campaign, we shall make use of the following channels to attract users: 
1. Social media – vk.com (Vkontakte, a social network that is popular in the CIS), Facebook, 

Instagram. Both the basic marketing tools within these networks and paid posts by 
‘opinion leaders’ will be engaged. The average CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), 
assuming correct use of these channels, comes to $1; 

2. YouTube – built-in advertising and placement of adverts by popular video bloggers, 
whose audience matches the criteria for the product’s target audience. The settings for 
built-in advertising make it possible to broadcast it to users who: 
● use YouTube to search for specific keywords; 
● have watched similar content; 
● watch videos on particular YouTube channels; 
● have visited specific websites (retargeting). 

    The average CAC for this channel comes to $2; 
3. Internet and mobile media, publishing posts and articles about the product. This serves 

two goals: it attracts users, and it also strengthens the positions of the brand—which is 
necessary for attracting partners. The CAC for this channel is difficult to calculate, since 
the majority of publications do not welcome product links. This channel will therefore be 
treated as secondary; 

4. Event marketing, organizing and participating in public events. This channel will be used 
to reinforce the brand, and also to boost the virality of the product by creating a positive 
impression among users. To illustrate, imagine an open public event is taking place in the 
city. The DS PLUS service will establish a geolocation radius within which users will 
receive a specified quantity of PlusCoin, set by the system, which can be used to 
purchase food or drinks from a partner who is trading for PlusCoin within that radius. 
The CAC for this channel can take various values depending on the intensity of 
participation, but the effect from participating in events is long-term, continuing to 
attract users for three months after the event is over. 



 

 

 
 
 

 

Apart from attracting users directly, these channels also serve to increase the LTV 
(Lifetime Value: the period during which the user retains interest in the app, and does not 
delete it), and also to bring back users who have stopped using the app. 

  
In addition to the specified channels, users will be attracted by means of virality (the 

dissemination of the product to users or partners by word of mouth, without marketing) 
and through a referral program that has already been launched within the app. 

We predict that roughly 10% of the users who are attracted will come through these 
two phenomena. 

Based on the total value of the combined CAC + LTV + user return, $9, we shall 
receive 2.7m users for $21.87m from the funds raised during the ICO and also from DS 
PLUS’s circulating capital. 
 

Various pieces of social research
2
, in various years, have shown that Russians spend an 

average of 50% of their monthly income on food. According to statistical data, the average 
wage for a natural person after tax in the Russian Federation is 30,800 rubles, from which it 
follows that a typical user spends no less than 15,400 rubles on foodstuffs. The average 
loyalty payment that partners are prepared to offer users is 5%, or 770 rubles per month. 
Given these calculations, a base of 2.7m active users, receiving 5% cashback on purchases, 
would generate in the consumer goods category a turnover of 2.079bn rubles per month in 
PlusCoin equivalent—and that represents just one of the many areas within which our 
partners operate. If we add the fields of entertainment, dining out, clothing, etc., the 
predicted turnover will exceed 10bn rubles per month in PlusCoin equivalent. 
 

We plan to reach this level of user numbers (2.7m people, or 1.87% of the population 
of the Russian Federation), and therefore of PlusCoin circulation, by the end of 2018. 
 
Countries of the European Union and Asia: 

Using a similar marketing strategy in the European Union countries and in Asia, we 
expect to expand the circle of our active users up to 7m people. The strategy for the 
product scaling in territories outside the Russian Federation consists of searching for 
projects analogous to DS PLUS and concluding partnership arrangements with them, within 
the framework of which they will also bring PlusCoin into circulation. In addition, DS PLUS

plans to begin expanding the project itself into international markets in May 2018 by 
opening franchises, and to attract residents of the countries into which we are expanding to 
become CEOs of the franchises. 

By the end of 2018 we plan to have brought all 29.7bn PlusCoin into circulation. By 
achieving coin liquidity and exchange rate growth, the system will function without 
additional emission of currency, maintaining the turnover of PlusCoin and increasing the 
value of this turnover in traditional currencies. If further emission becomes necessary, DS 
PLUS is committed to bringing tranches of PlusCoin into circulation from the stabilization 
fund. By the end of 2018 the system should also be able to maintain a stable state through 
the introduction of other cryptocurrencies into the infrastructure we shall have created. 
These will support the new, developing economy. 

 
Marketing after the ICO: 

DS PLUS understands that the successful development of this project may affect not 
just the PlusCoin market rate but also the development of the infrastructure, and will 
publish on its blog and in specialized resources statistics detailing the project’s realization, 
including: 

 
● the MAU (monthly active users) index – the number of unique users over the past 

month;  
● the total number of active users of the app;  
● the number of PlusCoin in circulation; 
● information about new partners who have introduced PlusCoin into their operations; 
● information about the number of new partners;  
● information about the total number of partners;  
● results of the project scaling;  
● summary analytics concerning the side products (the MarketPlace aggregator, the P2P 

platform, cryptoscoring). 
 
 

Since we realize that DS PLUS, like any other project, may have to close due to force 
majeure circumstances, we commit ourselves to introduce into circulation, through our 
partners, all tokens held in DS Plus coffers during the month preceding the planned 
liquidation period. If this cannot be achieved within that time period, we commit to destroy 
all our remaining PlusCoin prior to liquidation.
