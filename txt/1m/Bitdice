BitDice Casino is issuing  100 000 000 (one hundred million)  CSNO tokens,  
70%  of which will be offered to the public and entitle for  70%  of BitDice Casino’s 
net profit. 

All the proceeds from this public contribution will be used for business 
expansion only. 

Besides profit-sharing entitlement, the CSNO token will be one of the platform’s 
currencies of choice. It will be used to place bets, cash out, and reward players. 

The CSNO token will be exchangeable on the BitDice Casino website and 
tradable on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. 

BitDice Casino is a well-established and profitably operating cryptocurrency 
casino that is seeking capital contributions from the public to transform itself into 
a new-generation platform for online gaming experience.

G A M B L I N G 
I N D U S T R Y

The online gambling industry is valued at a stunning USD 46 billion, and it is 
expected to grow to USD 56 billion in 2018. Less than 5% of this market is 
attributed to cryptocurrency gambling. Although the share of cryptocurrency 
gambling is rising, traditional online gambling casinos are in no hurry to give up 
their share.

BitDice Casino has been targeting cryptocurrency gamblers up to this moment 
and has managed to capture a significant part of this market. In addition, it has 
gained over BTC 2300 in profit.

But the greatest opportunity lies within traditional space casinos. Rather than sit 
and wait for the fiat players to gradually shift to the new paradigm, we want to 
be the first to get close to them, to build bridges and introduce the concept of 
“provably fair,” along with games that have a lower house edge. 

In our perspective, the cryptocurrency gambling market is relatively dense 
and crowded, and it outpaces the flow of new players and keeps margins 
depressed. The logical step would be to get outside the box and start thinking 
“bigger.”

O N  B L O C K C H A I N 
( S M A R T  C O N T R A C T S )

Recently, we have seen a strong and ambitious move from gambling 
entertainment developers to build next generation games exclusively on 
blockchain (smart contracts). Allegedly, the main driver behind this move, apart 
from upbeat general sentiment, is to bring in a heightened transparency between 
a player and a casino.   

BitDice realizes that, in the years to come, the tendency to fit online games into 
blockchain is likely to grow. However, our current analysis, along with multi-year 
experience in the industry, dictates that we continue to use conventional off-
chain solutions for now, as the only economically sensible solution.

C A V E A T S  W I T H 
O N - C H A I N  G A M E S

We have identified several major hurdles associated with running the games on 
blockchain that negatively impact our decision to join the mainstream until recently:

Low speed and limited bandwidth capacity (latency between user action and 
subsequent result) 

Lack of flexibility in game variations and logic 
 

High cost of smart contract execution 

Inability to pay out rewards, incentives, and other bonuses to loyal players 

Insufficient control over players, to detect fraudulent actions related to bonuses 
and affiliate payouts 

Complications connected with seamlessness to play games

Inability to attract clients who prefer betting with fiat currencies 

  

Complications related to integration of complex-logic games to the platform 
aimed at maximizing wagered amounts

Technically impossible to verify players’ domiciles to comply with certain 
regulations

Dependency on unknown 3rd party Oracle providers (Oracalize, random.org, etc.)

Bets on smart contracts are limited to 2 per second per user, while BitDice Casino is able to process 
over 20 bets per second per user. 

Upgrades will allow us to process up to 50 wagers per second per user.

Some games are very dynamic in nature, where latency is simply not allowed. 

For micro bets, it is a real deal-breaker, which makes certain games economically meaningless, 
as transaction fees can exceed wager amounts.

This is a serious limitation that puts the marketing part of the business at risk. 

Games on blockchain require a special Browser or a plug-in to play. Mobile devices are 
not supported.

The share of this type of client is overwhelming compared to cryptocurrency clients.  

10

And the list goes on.

G A M B L I N G 
P R O V I D E R S ’  I C O s

BitDice has attentively monitored recently-run ICOs related to cryptocurrency gambling projects 
on blockchain and has detected that many shortcomings recognized here are having the exact 
same impact as described earlier.

Example 1 - www.vdice.io

Started in June 2016, vDice has processed around 52,000 bets and has paid out around 13,000 
ETHs to the players in gross winnings, which effectively put their house profit in the range 
of 1000 ETHs, according to our rough estimates. The house operates at a 1.9% house edge, 
according to their website - almost twice as high as the average dice project.

It should be noted, however, that vDice, having itself been built around “proclaimed 
transparency”, is having a hard time revealing its own gambling statistics. There are no figures to 
reflect basic metrics, such as wagered volumes, profits, etc. One should dedicate extra time to 
crunch the numbers from multiple Ethereum contracts to derive conclusions.

Example 2 - www.etheroll.io

Etheroll has processed around 26,000 bets since July 2016, and has earned roughly 650 ETHs 
in profits. Players have paid approx. 140 ETHs in transaction fees, which is more than 20% of the 
house profit.  

Example 3 - BitDice Casino

For the same period, BitDice Casino, operating on a 1% house edge with its dice game, has 
processed over 9 million bets in ETH alone. More than 157,000 ETHs have been wagered in total, 
and almost 3,500 ETHs have been earned by the house.

The striking difference between the blockchain-based solution and the conventional off-chain 
solution is that, as we see it today, the playing community does not seem to care that much about 
“sophisticated transparency.” In fact, players take a simple pragmatic approach in selecting a 
reputable casino provider with a verifiable track-record, low execution cost, and their favorite 
choice of games. 



9

BitDice Casino is proud to provide this experience and is thus rewarded with loyalty in return.

The “provably fair” concept can be implemented off-chain as a reliable and verifiable method that 
technically excludes any possibility for a casino to cheat players, even if it really wanted to. This 
method is widely accepted by the playing community and has never been challenged. In BitDice 
perspective, as long as the players feel confident that the outcomes of the games are absolutely 
unbiased, they will take the path of least resistance, i.e. choose gaming providers where they can 
play fast and with no hassle.

BitDice Casino on-chain

Yet, BitDice Casino is no way blockchain agnostic. We believe that in the future, the blockchain 
will undergo technological advancements and many of the problems related to speed and cost 
will be resolved. That’s why proactively, along with developing new games off-chain, BitDice will 
dedicate a great deal of effort to exploring various blockchain technologies for the purpose of 
transforming some of its games on-chain.

On-chain solutions

Specifically, we will be watching carefully over the IOTA protocol - lightweight and simple 
in nature. Its role is to enable trust-free and fee-less transactional settlements, as well as 
tamper-proof data transmission. In IOTA, each component is a stand-alone application that is 
optimized for its purpose, without trading off performance or functionality for other applications. 
Additionally, this gives users of IOTA choice to tailor their usage of the protocol, instead of 
imposing the overhead of the features, even if they originally only need to use one of them for 
instance.

I C O  P R O C E E D S 

BitDice Casino is aiming to raise at least USD 10,000,000 to pursue its transformational strategy. 
For many years, it has successfully performed as a cryptocurrency gambling site, yet it is time to 
start “thinking big.” 

Our ultimate goal is to enter the traditional online gambling market to offer fiat players a wider 
choice of absolutely fair and lower-edge gaming products.    

To learn more about our development goals, please read the platform’s Roadmap section.     

We intend to use ICO proceeds as follows:

— Compensating the development team for enhancing BitDice functionality, applying new technology and integrating 
gambling providers into the platform.

— Developing its own unique and provably fair games on top of the old ones.

— Acquiring necessary licenses to be able to operate with fiat currencies as a traditional gambling entity across as many 
regions as possible.

— Paying legal fees to bring the whole business structure into full compliance with regulatory framework.

  

10% of the funds will be 
used for promotion and 
marketing purposes.

40% of the funds will be 
stored as the casino’s house

bets and bonuses to the 
players on the whole array 
of games presented.

25% of the funds will be kept in vault as reserve. At BitDice’s discretion and dependent on 
market conditions, some portion of reserves can  be used to buy out tokens on the secondary 
market to reduce public float.

25% of the funds will be used 
by BitDice Casino to fund 
capital expenditures related 
to platform development and 
business expansion. It will 
primarily consist of:

The structure of proceeds utilization is designed to ensure the platform’s profitability in the long 
run with minimal operational risks. BitDice Casino is committed to implementing its strategy in the 
best interest of CSNO token holders.

R O A D M A P

We position ourselves as a gambling entertainment provider and will use the proceeds from 
contributions to build a complex one-stop platform that will combine in-house developed games, 
third party casino operators, sports betting, and much more.

Apart from developing games and mobile applications, BitDice Casino will be experimenting with 
on-chain solutions to give players the option to try out the ongoing technological innovations in the 
gaming industry.

Our primary focus, however, will be on entering the traditional online casino market and getting 
exposure to the other 95% of the market, previously inaccessible to cryptocurrency gambling sites.

T E C H N O L O G Y

BitDice Casino uses a cutting-edge technology stack to provide users with greatest degree of 
security and high level efficiency.  For security reason, BitDice Casino will not reveal the full setup 
of its systems, but we will describe, in general, how some of its core modules interact with each 
other.

The website is a public access point, which acts as a proxy. It is exposed to Internet users and 
communicates with a web server via VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). Web server follows strict 
rules related to handling communication channels between other servers. Those servers are not 
directly accessible from the website and cannot communicate with each other without passing 
the web server. The typology of this kind ensures that the security level of the network is the 
highest available without sacrificing efficiency. (Figure 1.)

To provide additional security level within the network, Bitdice Casino splits the core back-
end engine into several independent micro-services run with different access privileges. It 
helps to prevent gaining unauthorized access to data sensitive modules (such as secret seeds 
generation (RNG), bets verifications, etc.) among core BitDice developers. The micro-services are 
written in Elixir (Erlang VM), a highly scalable language that enables “zero downtime” updates. 
The technology we use in BitDice Casino is the same one used in many Telecommunication 
companies, when downtime issue is critical. (Figure 2.)

FIGURE 1 .



13

Although the most critical components are written in Elixir, the prevailing code is still written in 
Ruby language. BitDice sets out to get rid of the Ruby part of the code and fully move into Elixir 
by the end of Q1 2018 to improve betting latency from the current 20-40ms to 2-5ms. It will also 
enable us to handle concurrently several thousands online clients without any downtick in speed.

Security is a complicated thing to say least. None can be absolutely sure to claim that their 
system is 100% bulletproof from hacking. BitDice does not want to say it too. Yet, we can 
reassure that the current state of applied technology allows us to monitor the whole setup and 
expeditiously respond to any suspicious activity triggered from outside or within inside of the 
network. Our system collects the data on any type of activity that gets interacted with BitDice’s 
servers. This data is constantly being analyzed and compared to the “mean” historical values, so 
that any outliers will trigger immediate alarm. 

BitDice has never experienced unauthorized leakage into its servers and is proud to maintain the 
status of ‘unbreakable service provider.’ (Figure 3.)

BitDice Casino S.L.R. was launched in 2014 and has been going through continual improvement. 
As of today and thanks to its loyal stakeholders, BitDice Casino operates as the largest online 
bitcoin casino with a crowdfunded bankroll of over 4000 BTC combined across different 
cryptocurrencies. 

Over the years, the developer team has been at the forefront of dice sites innovation, carefully 
watching over the industry and searching for the optimal model to be equally attractive to players 
and bankroll investors alike. Today, one can safely claim that the balance was properly found and 
maintained. 

We were able to grow significantly in revenue, profit, and number of unique clients. BitDice Casino 
is a recognized player in the bitcoin gambling community with a sustainable leading position.

Here are a few throwbacks to some notable facts about BitDice Casino in the past:

It was the first one among competitors to structure itself as a commercial entity (Republic of Costa Rica).

It was the first one among competitors to implement the WebSocket technology with a mobile-centric 

focus, to ensure the fastest betting speed possible in the online casino industry.

It was the first one among competitors to integrate the dynamic Kelly criterion investment model, 

allowing bankroll investors to fine-tune their risk profile for maximizing returns. 

Performance in numbers

BitDice Casino’s historic performance is fully transparent and accessible through an independent 
monitoring agent at www.dicesites.com, which has been covering major cryptocurrency gambling 
sites since 2015. 

Presently BitDice Casino operates a selection of games where Hi-Lo dice amounts for the 
largest share of the revenue stream. Over 70% of that stream is attributed to BTC bets; the 
rest is distributed among other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and DogeCoin. 
Traditionally, BTC bets have been the strongest stream throughout its history.

BitDice Casino is a stickler for fairness. It innovates business practices that are then followed in 
the cryptocurrency gambling industry. One such practice is to ensure that the outcomes of the 
games are absolutely random.

As a proof of its authenticity, BitDice Casino makes it compulsory that all games created by 
BitDice are provably fair. If a game is not provably fair, then BitDice and our esteemed player 
community have no use for it.

BitDice Casino verifies the RNG (Random Number Generator) certificates of all third-party games 
offered on its platform. If a game from a third-party provider does not have a verifiable RNG 
certificate, there is no chance it would be offered to the users.

BitDice casino makes certain to work only with reputable companies that also have zero 
tolerance for cheating and have never been caught cheating.

Presently BitDice offers its own games:

P R O V A B L E 
F A I R N E S S

Dice - provably fair                   BlackJack - provably fair

It integrates numerous slot games from Endorfina, GameArt, and Habanero.

To learn more about how provable fairness is implemented, please read Technical section in help 
menu https://www.bitdice.me/help

Security of funds and user information is our top priority. Over the years, BitDice Casino has 
faced myriad attempts to hack its system; the website has been under DDoS attack hundreds of 
times and we were asked for a ransom.

Proudly speaking, none of these attempts have ever succeeded. BitDice Casino is continually 
improving its end-to-end security measures, auditing processes, and reducing the “attack 
surface” of its infrastructure.

To increase the security of users’ accounts, BitDice Casino suggests 
or requires users to implement the following measures:

S E C U R I T Y

Complete an email confirmation whenever a player signs in on a new device and/or 
through a new IP address

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

Enable e-mail authorization for all logins regardless if they are from a device or IP 
addresses frequently used or not

Enable IP whitelists to prevent possible unauthorized access from reasonably malicious 
IP blocks

Enable the “Lock Withdrawal” feature, when withdrawals can only be made to certain 
addresses

Cryptocurrency storage:

The overwhelming majority of BitDice funds are stored in cold wallets. Only approximately 3% 
of these funds can be accessible in hot wallet for day-to-day operations. Cold wallets are not 
available from the platform servers, they are stored off-line and require manual intervention.

The injection of new capital will help us fulfill product milestones as described in the roadmap 
section. Each and every additional product or feature will further improve our strength and 
effectively add extra value to CSNO holders. 

BitDice Casino has simulated a few tentative ROI scenarios to illustrate how different capital
sizes will impact ROI.

Below are 3 case scenarios with different input variables:

BitDice Casino recognizes two primary input variables that will impact the future bottom
line of the business.

Wager growth - a product of the casino’s games options and clients base

Attribution to higher-edge and lower-edge games. 

“Mediocre” scenario implies a 2x jump in wager with organic additional growth of 
20% YoY. Profit implies 80% share attribution to 1% house edge, and 20% to high 
margin house edge 4%.

“Optimistic” scenario implies a 3x jump in wager with organic additional growth of 
20% YoY. Profit implies 70% share attribution to 1% house edge, and 30% 
to high margin house edge 4%.

“Extremely optimistic” scenario implies a 4x jump in wager with organic additional 
growth of 20% YoY. Profit implies 60% share attribution to 1% house edge, and 40% 
to high margin house edge 4%.

Higher proceeds from the ICO will make implementation of certain scenarios more likely than 
others. For example, licensing and meeting compliance requirements for fiat currency games will 
demand substantial financial resources. The strategy to expand over that market is our ultimate 
goal and should give us a huge boost in revenue terms, and thus also in profits.  

Similarly, the development and integration of new games with a higher margin will also correlate 
with the amount of capital we are able to raise.  

According to our estimates, even in case of the most humble scenario, BitDice will be able to 
perform better than it does today. Our former bankroll investors and CSNO holders will enjoy 
higher ROI with regular dividend payments, boosted publicity, and recognition of secondary 
market.

ICO Schedule

Initial Contribution Offering will commence on August 15, 2017 (UTC 00:00) 

and end on September 15, 2017 (UTC 00:00).

Token Supply

The CSNO tokens will be limited to (one hundred million) 100,000,000 units.
Only 70% of the tokens will be released to public.
The remainder 30% will stay in BitDice Casino Owner’s possession. 

Token Price

The price of the token will be determined at the end of the ICO period and it will depend 
on the overall capital raised.The final price of the token will be calculated at the cut-off 
time using this formula:

CSNO price = Proceeds from ICO (in USD) / 100,000,000 tokens

Accepted Contributions

Contributions will be accepted in Bitcoins, Litecoins, Ethers, and DogeCoins.

Cut-off time

Cut-off time is the exact date and time when BitDice Casino will cease to accept any 
further contributions. 

Cut-off time will be used as a reference point to count final balances across different 
wallets and determine cryptocurrency rates in USD value.

Cut-off time is the end of the ICO: September 15, 2017 (UTC 00:00) 

Allocation of Tokens

Once the final balances are counted and the rate of each funding currency is 
determined, the process of CSNO tokens allocation will kick in. 

Within the following 7 days, everyone who participated in the ICO will be credited with 
CSNO tokens. 

Each and every contributor will be deposited with CSNO tokens in proportion to its 
contributed share at the moment of cut-off.    

Token Creation Ratios

Early contributors will create more CSNO tokens than later ones.

The incentives are split as follows: 

First Week = 1.15 X CSNO per contribution
Second Week = 1.10 X CSNO per contribution
Third Week = 1.05 X CSNO per contribution
Fourth Week = 1.00 X CSNO per contribution

Existing Investors and the ICO

All existing bankroll investors will be offered an option to convert their investments into 
CSNO tokens during the presale period.

As a way to provide our valuable stakeholders with an incentive and show appreciation, 
BitDice Casino will give every investor an additional 5% bonus on top of the 15% 
discount as the earliest contributors.

The presale period will only be available to existing bankroll investors.

In case the Investor does not wish to accept the offer, BitDice Casino will allow such 
investors a grace period of 2 months to divest and withdraw the funds. 

All the funds that did not participate in the ICO will be automatically divested and 
returned to Bankroll Investors by the end of September 2017.     

Off-Chain Crediting 

To avoid high load on blockchain and to increase the responsiveness during the 
ICO with minimal cost of token creation, BitDice Casino will issue its tokens in one 
transaction call. 

The server will update contribution amounts in each currency in real time.

Disclaimer

The token economy is relatively new and incredibly innovative. Tokens could be 
impacted by regulatory actions, including restrictions on ownership, use, or possession. 
Regulations or other circumstances may demand that the CSNO mechanics be altered 
in all or part. Therefore, BitDice Casino may revise mechanics to comply with regulatory 
requirements or other governmental or business obligations. Nevertheless, we believe 
our planned mechanics to be proper and likely in the final version.

Contributors assume risk when participating in the ICO. BitDice Casino could be subject 
to attack, bugs, or operational errors, and other unforeseen problems could result in the 
loss of stored value.
