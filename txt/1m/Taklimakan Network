Introduction

Investment drives the economy — no major project is realized without 
investment capital. In return, investor expects a reward for the 
participation of their capital in the project and for the risks associated 
with its implementation. 

Beginner investors often order investment strategies to increase 
profitability. However, an efficient strategy can only be developed by an 
experienced financial adviser. 

In 2017, the average financial literacy rate only reached 55% in the 
developed economies. This raises the risks of incompetent actions on the 
part of intermediaries and even large investors. 

With the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, the role of financial literacy 
gets more important than ever. Most players in this market make 
investments irrationally and inefficiently, relying primarily on intuition 
and emotions. Investors often make important decisions based solely on 
posts in social networks, friends' advice or news from unverified sources. 

We believe that investment should be based on knowledge, experience, 
analysis and the use of trading tools. 

TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK is an educational platform for crypto 
enthusiasts, analysts and traders, which enables users to make 
professional investment decisions regardless of the level of their 
financial literacy using educational resources, analytical and trading 
tools, reviews, etc. 

Taklimakan Network benefits both beginners and advanced users. The 
platform gives access to aggregated news and analytical materials on 
cryptocurrencies — each material undergoes professional moderation by 
the platform’s own analytical service. 

Experienced traders and analysts will have the opportunity to publish 
their own trading recommendations and analytical materials. In addition, 
they will be able to conduct webinars, lectures, and individual 
consultations. 

The goal of Taklimakan Network team is to bring together financial 
analysts, crypto consultants and enthusiasts and increase the overall level 
of financial expertise to raise market to a whole new level. 

Taklimakan Network will become your mentor in the world of 
cryptocurrency, helping you choose the right way to manage your 
personal finances.

Industry Issues 

Crypto investment is a time-consuming process with substantial built-in 
risks. Most of the difficulties arise because of the underdeveloped crypto-
exchange platforms, low level of financial literacy of the crypto 
enthusiasts and their inability to use trading and analytical tools. 

Crypto market is at an early stage in development, and investors often act 
irrationally, relying in their actions on unreliable sources of information 
and superficial judgments of other players. Most players do not resort to 
the help of trading and financial instruments for statistical analysis. It is 
difficult for a rational investor to find a valid source of information. 

Financial analysts and experienced traders spend a lot of 
resources and time on transaction costs, reputation costs, and 
on engaging subscribers to their sources. 

The Audience 

The main task of Taklimakan Network founders is to create an expert 
community, connecting the leading crypto analysts, experienced 
investors and enthusiasts on the same platform to bring the crypto 
market to a new level. 

Yours, Taklimakan Team

Issues with Crypto Enthusiasts 

‣ No reliable news aggregator and no source of pre-moderated 
high-quality analytical material 

Users spend a lot of time and resources to process data from dozens of 
channels. Beginners do not have the opportunity to assess reliability of 
the source and check the facts outlined in the news. 

‣ Asymmetric distribution of information and distrust to 
intermediaries 

Most people do not dare buying cryptocurrency due to distrust and fear 
that the intermediary will disappear after the first money transfer to him 
or her. 

‣ Low level of financial literacy and investment knowledge 
The market of cryptocurrencies has changed dramatically in recent years 
— it has grown from a small, marginalized community to a serious entity 
with a yearly turnover of $500 billion. Cryptocurrency now interests 
hundreds of thousands individual enthusiasts, who do not always possess 
sufficient competence and the necessary knowledge to make rational 
market decisions. 

‣ No proper market education and difficulties finding a mentor 
It is especially difficult for beginners to make independent decisions on 
crypto market due to a lack of experience and mentors. At the moment, 
it is virtually impossible to find an educational resource with reliable and 
structured information about the market, its tools and blockchain 
technologies overall. 

‣ Problems of transparency and security 
Crypto exchange often implies transferring money to the fund managers 
or an individual, which leads to problems with returning assets and 
limited ability to control the activities of the intermediary. 

Issues With Analysts and Traders 

‣ No quality analytical platform  
Investors make decisions based on data from different sources, which 
vary significantly. There are no analytical tools or reviews on the market — 
all analysis is done "manually". Large funds conduct in-house analysis, 
thereby significantly increasing their profits. 

‣ Lack of trust 
Financial advisors and traders spend a lot of resources and time to build 
reputation and engage subscribers because of the large amount of fraud 
in the market.

‣ Underdevelopment and lack of technical equipment 
Existing platforms of complicate the investment process and cause 
inconvenience at the stages of depositing and withdrawal of funds. 
Hackers are constantly finding new soft spots in security systems. 

Industry Overview 

The rapid growth in the capitalisation of cryptocurrencies and high 
profitability led to a stunning increase in the popularity of these digital 
assets among investors. This inevitably attracted the attention of financial 
regulators and governments of many countries. 

More and more people are considering the possibility of 
investing in cryptocurrency. The number of Bitcoin purses 
exceeded 24.4 million and continues to grow rapidly. 100,000 
new wallets are created daily within Ethereum Blockchain 
network.

Industry leaders, the largest exchanges have recorded unprecedented 
demand for digital currency trading services. These companies were 
forced to suspend registration of participants due to an exceedingly fast 
influx of new users and limited server capacities for processing 
transactions. 

According to the heads of biggest crypto exchange markets, several 
million new players join the market weekly. 

High profitability of cryptocurrency assets attracts not only individual 
crypto enthusiasts to the industry, but also funds investing in crypto-
currencies and ICO projects. 

Today there are 226 crypto investing funds in the world, compared  
to 37 at the beginning of 2017. 

According to Autonomous NEXT research center, total value of crypto 
assets under management of hedge funds is estimated in the range 
between $3.5 billion and $5 billion. 

Active interest in technology is observed on the part of the real economy 
and leaders of many industries. For example, large banks like Santander, 
UniCredit, UBS, ReiseBank, and CIBC are already testing and 
successfully integrating the Blockchain-based Ripple system, solving the 
problem of high transaction costs and allowing to save up to 33% on 
operating expenses. The technology was not left without attention from 
the national governments — for example, the government of Japan 
concluded a contract with IOTA to create a joint project to integrate IoT 
into the business environment of major manufacturers and financial 
companies in Tokyo. The likes of Volkswagen, Microsoft, Bosch,

their intention to use Blockchain technologies in their processes, and 
some have already patented the possibility of such integration.

losses of money by buyers of a particular cryptocurrency.

Token Sale: Participation 

TKLN tokens can be bought at taklimakan.io. 
Various cryptocurrencies are accepted: BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC, NEO, 
DASH, XMR, NEM, ZEC, as well as many other crypto-currencies that are 
listed on the website. 
All funds received from the sale of TKLN tokens are placed in Escrow and 
are transferred to the Taklimakan Network team according to the 
roadmap — after Token Sale ended and users received their tokens. 

Moreover, in order to minimize the risks of fraudulent actions by third 
parties, all collected funds will be stored in a multisignature purse with 3 
signatures. All major transactions will take place only if there are all 3 
signatures. 

We recommend the following wallets: 

The following wallets are not suitable for participation in Taklimakan 
Network Token Sale. Do not use any of the following wallets to
