NEW GENERATION WEBCAM PLATFORM



202

Annotation

Live Stars is creating the new generation webcam platform that implements blockchain 
technology. The platform has a transparent structure and it offers a multitude of advantages 
against the projects currently existing on the market. The main goals of our project are to create a 
platform with an automated system, eliminate the existing webcam industry problems, and 
organize the work of the Live Stars´ project.

We set ourselves a number of objectives: optimizing the internal business model, eliminating high 
commissions, eliminating the delays in payments, improving the security, providing the users with 
complete anonymity, releasing the models’ relationship with the client from any intermediaries 
and human errors, and making the platform more convenient for all participants.

Our experience in the software development and blockchain technology, as well as our experience 
and internal knowledge of the webcam industry, allows us to create a modern platform, which will 
stand above all existing analogues.

Introduction

As of today, the webcam industry has evolved from a small adult entertainment niche into a 
multi-million business with boundless prospects.

However, currently all existing webcam platforms present a number of fundamental problems that 
dampen progress in this industry, and this substantively diminishes the incomes of those 
individuals involved, as well as reduces the interest of any potential customers. Because of the 
no-opacity process, this segment is often under negative criticism from the users and models.

Innovations in the webcam industry today have become a necessity. The overall level of the 
technological solutions is growing rapidly, which increases the requirement level of the online 
entertainment form.

What is Live Stars

Live Stars is the world's first webcam platform in the online adult entertainment industry that is 

using blockchain technology to fundamentally upgrade the system and to solve its main 

problems.

Live Stars is a fundamentally new platform with a different business model based on the exclusion 

of intermediaries and automating all the processes. Implementation of the smart contracts in the 

business logic and financial platform segment provides for a more effective, safe, and convenient 

interaction between users, models, affiliates, and the platform itself. In the following chapters, we 

will take a closer look at the existing problems and solutions of Live Stars.

Live Stars´ platform uses its own token “LIVE” as a form of the payment for services rendered. 

LIVE is the only form of payment. 

Key features of the platform are:

full anonymity and safety of its users

the storage security and data encryption

the absence of the intermediaries and financial segment´s limitations

absence of the minimum payments, limits and charge backs

instant cash payouts without the third party involvement

the highest revenue percentage for the models

encryption of the personal correspondence, including from the administration

the streaming connection technology without using the servers

earnings possibility for the users

easier and more convenient to work for the beginner models and affiliates 

transparency and the open source code

Structure of webcam industry, Problems and solutions

Webcam industry: The main features of the system

When speaking about problems in the system, its structure should first be discussed.

Several famous projects such as: LiveJasmin, Chaturbate, Bongacams, MyFreeCams, and others, hold 

the leading positions in the market today.

We have carefully checked the activities of these projects and can see a number of problems in this 

obsolete business-scheme.

Participants of the webcam system:

The website–webcam platform, which provides access to models' broadcasts.

Users who are interested in models' services.

Models who are working within certain platforms according to contracts.

Affiliates–partners who attract new users to the website.

Webcam platforms, as a legal entity, can sign contracts with models as an employer, provide them

with creditworthy web traffic and keep the license requirements' in their control.

Activity of the platform is supported by numerous staff, divided into different subdivisions: 

department of payment acceptance, responsible for checking of transactions, department of 

verification for models, where models are being checked for compliance with the internal rules of the 

site, as well as department of payment for models, technical support, moderation department, 

marketing department etc.

Currently, the work of the departments is not automated – the staff in the leading webcam sites have 

to process huge volumes of information and requests manually and around the clock. To cover the 

related costs, the platform has to require substantial commissions from payments – about 60%. Thus, 

if user has bought internal value tokens in the amount 100USD and has sent this amount to the 

model, she will only get 40USD. The commission level varies from 50% to 80% depending on the 

platform.

To get services of the site-platform, user buys tokens. The purchase passes through different 

payments processors, after that transaction is checked by the payment department.  In case of 

credit card fraud or in the case of verified mistake, there is a possibility the department can require 

ID documentation in order to identify the person. Documents are stored in a database for the future 

identification. If the user has successfully passed the test, he gets tokens in his account and can 

transfer it to the models or spend it on extra services of the site.

To receive their earnings, the model has to earn an obligatorily minimal amount according to 

 www.livestars.io



Now, as we acknowledged the structure of the webcam industry, we can go into deeper detail 

about the actual problems in the system and their solutions, all offered by our team.

Problem 1: Lack of user anonymity

Each webcam site has its own database, where information about all registered users is stored.

Problems of the modern webcam industry and their
efficient solutions from Live Stars

contract with the platform. As a rule, websites stipulate a minimal amount of 50USD. Moreover, 

payments are transferred within a strict fixed period of time (mostly once a week, on a certain 

day). During this hold, the model's account is being checked for possible fraudulent activity. As a 

result, earnings of models can be blocked by the administration until all circumstances will be 

clear or payment can be completely denied.

For example, on Saturday, a model has earned 100USD for the first time and wants to withdraw

money onto her card. However, the site is making payments only on Thursdays. From the date of 

the request, there are 7 days of a hold and on Thursday, the other instance called payout 

department is making the money withdrawal manually. In this real-life example, the model was 

waiting for money from the website for 12 days. The LiveJasmin project pays the models 20-25 

days after the end of the two-week period. Money crediting can also take some time, depending 

on the chosen method of payout. Bank transfers, for instance, takes 3 - 5 business days.

The same scheme is working when payout is to be transferred to the studio where models have

been hired. The studio or agency are mediators between the platform and the models. The 

mediator takes commission from the model's earnings. If the model works not individually, but for 

the studio, she gets on average 20-30% of the amount that the user spends on her.

The principle of minimal payments and expectation times are also valid for partners of webcam 

sites so-called affiliates or webmasters, who earn money by attracting creditworthy web traffic.

248

 www.livestars.io



249

 www.livestars.io

This includes the following:

Successful and declined purchases (transactions).

Names and surnames, mentioned during transactions.

IP-addresses, geo-location.

Time of login/logout and other system parameters.

Credit cards details or other methods of payments.

ID numbers in case they were requested and user has submitted them.

All user activity is also recorded, for example, payments to certain models, times of private chats.

Note, that all chats on the sites are stored as logs, including all private chats with models, and 

they can be available for administrators at any time to check if there has been any violation of the 

stipulated rules.

In case the customer uses his own webcam on the platform (“cam-to-cam” option), broadcast 

from user to model is going from the server of the platform. It means that private broadcast can 

be watched by the system administrator or any other personnel.

The system can easily track the repeated registrations and it binds the real account owner in

accordance with available information.

All this information is controlled by different employees of the platform and since the system is

not open source, no one can completely guarantee that the gathered data is stored safely, 

encoded, and will be deleted within a certain time or upon the user's request.

Live Stars’ solution:

Our team believes that users must be in complete anonymity and security. Only such

conditions can allow for the enjoyment of the wide range of services of webcam for adults.

Services of the Live Stars platform can only be paid for using cryptocurrency tokens. Lack of 

payments from  fiat currencies makes us free from gathering and requesting the personal details 

from users.

Cryptocurrencies will be bought by users from outside services so that way the Live Stars team

won't have the access to information about transactions.

To get services from models on the Live Stars platform, a user who tours the site has to buy 

“LIVE” tokens using another cryptocurrency. For our customers’ convenience, there will be a 

conversion option in accordance with the current exchange rates. In case the customer prefers to 

pay in other currency, there will be the possibility to pass to the independent outside service to 

purchase cryptocurrency, including fiat currencies.



Private video-chats, as well as private messages, will be encrypted one-to-one without any 

mediators.

Currently, it can be accomplished when using such open-source projects like WebRTC.

All the above mentioned solutions will be confirmed by an independent audit of the source code 

which will be in the public domain.

Problem 2: Payment errors of users

Within usual webcam platforms, all payments from users usually pass through many outside

services of payment acceptance. Usage of such a huge system often leads to failures and errors. 

As a result, money crediting to the internal account of user can be postponed for an indefinite 

period or even cancelled.

Live Stars’ solution:

As mentioned above, all money transfers within the Live Stars are made exclusively in 

cryptocurrencies. Such a format of payment for the service is a much faster and safer method for 

any user. The transactions do not require the involvement of third-party intermediaries or 

verification by the platform staff.

Problem 3: Low revenue share for models

At the present moment, webcam platforms can seldom offer their models more than 30% from 

the amount transferred by the customer. Moreover, payments do not always correspond to the 

promised rate – different hidden fees and conversion rates sometimes lead to partial deductions 

of the total amount and this causes distrust amongst models. It should also be noted that there is 

a commission fee charged by some e-wallets and internet banking solutions.

Live Stars’ solution:

Lack of a payment department, due to its uselessness, as well as the automated work of some 

other departments, allow our platform to obtain economic efficiency. Thereby guaranteeing the 

payment to the models 70%, with the ability to raise revenues up to 80% from the total amount 

transferred by the customer. Thanks to the open source code and lack of mediators for payment 

acceptance, the financial area of the platform is absolutely clear for models.

2410

 www.livestars.io



Problem 4: Minimal amount, delays and errors of payouts for models.

The minimum amount for possible withdrawal of the model´s finances today is often $50, if not 

higher. Even when the minimum amount is reached, the model has to wait for a specific day of the 

week, and even the end of the payout’s period, in order to receive their earnings. In practice, a lot 

of beginner models, who tried themselves in this role for the first time, are facing stiff competition 

from the top models and cannot collect the minimum amount. The prolonged payouts waiting 

time also undermines their trust and leads to models terminating their work. 

Live Stars’ solution:

All payments on the Live Stars platform are automated using the open smart contracts function, 

which completely eliminates the human factor, and significantly minimizes the risk of losing 

money. Thus, the model is able to exchange any amount of tokens using the third party payment 

service which our company will have a contract with.

The beginner model, one that is online for the first time, will be able to immediately exchange the 

resulting earnings using the third party payment service which our company will have a contract 

with. Live Stars provides the lowest learning curve within the webcam industry. The probability 

that the model, one that started working for the first time, will continue to earn through Live Stars 

is multiplying.

Problem 5: Lack of access to payout settings

At the present moment, payment settings are available for the administration of the webcam

platform only.

To change the method of payment or other settings, the model has to contact the correspondent 

department, where it will be required to confirm the identity by documentation. It is obvious that 

such a system requires extra time and effort, both for the website staff, and the models.

Live Stars’ solution:

On our platform, there are no limiting settings for token exchange using the third party payment 

service which our company will have a contract with. This helps diminish the staff and some 

departments to make the company economy more efficient.  Models will have full control over 

their finances.

2411

 www.livestars.io



Problem 6: Not transparent rating levels of models

It is obvious that popularity and earnings of the model directly depends on her position in the

site's top lists. Currently, none of the webcam platforms shows the processing algorithm for the 

rating levels to the public. This inevitably causes conflicts and suspicions.

Live Stars’ solution:

The processing algorithm of rating levels on our platform will be intuitive for everyone.

Moreover, our open source system allows everyone to make sure that the models' positions are 

made automatically, correctly, and impartially.

Problem 7: Insecurity of personal data

In order to prove the age of the model, the model has to submit a copy of her ID when registering 

on any webcam sites. This information is stored in a database for further verification even in case 

of an account removal by the model. If, in the future, the model will register on the website again, 

her new account will be connected with the existing database record. Blocked models won't be 

able to pass registration again and it can be checked with the saved data. Currently, there is no 

possibility to check and make sure that files with the documents are encoded and safe enough. 

There is no guarantee that data cannot be caught by intruders. There is also no confidence in the 

fact that files could be deleted after a certain amount of time.

Live Stars’ solution:

Our platform is organized in a way that allows the model to upload or delete all the necessary

information themselves, which is guaranteed by the open source code. After any document is 

uploaded and verified to the administration, it will be encrypted. If the model deletes the 

document, she will not be able to start a stream and will only be allowed to continue after the 

document is uploaded and verified again.

Problem 8: Chargebacks (cancellation of model’s earnings)

Nowadays, stolen credit cards are often used to pay for the model’s services. In this case, it’s fairly

easy for the actual owner of the card to prove that they haven’t made any payments to the 

platform. If that happens, the website is obligated to return the charged amount back to the 

owner’s account. Sometimes, the funds are withdrawn from the model’s account, which violates 

the values of fair labor compensation.

2412

 www.livestars.io



Live Stars’ solution:

Since all financial activities on the Live Stars platform are made using cryptocurrency, credit card 

fraud becomes impossible. This gives the models full confidence in the security of their earnings.

Problem 9: Problems of affiliates similar to the problems of models

One of the most important aspects of any webcam system is its affiliates – the website’s

partners whose responsibilities include attracting financially reliable web traffic to the platform.

They encounter some of the aforementioned problems: the minimum withdrawal amount, waiting 

for the payment period, possibility of payments being declined etc.

Live Stars’ solution:

As mentioned before, there are no minimum token exchange amount on the Live Stars platform, 

which provides immediate payments, it guaranties no delays, and eliminates the human factor 

from the equation. The system functions automatically, which is a firm guarantee of both the 

integrity and transparency of payments for the models and any associated affiliates. This provides 

a simple learning curve and rapid earnings.

LIVE STARS’ additional advantages

There will be no purchase limits on the platform.

We plan to cut server maintenance expenses significantly by utilizing peer-to-peer content distribu-

tion network for public streaming.

Additional work will be done in order to make our platform compatible with the modern Lovense 

and Ohmibod toys. These are simple adult toys which react to the amount of the tip given by the 

user and are very popular with the models.

Private video chats and messages will be carried out through webRTC on ‘one-to-one’ principle 

without a server. No mediators (including administrators) will have access to private information.

The LIVE token acquisition interface will be simple and intuitive, and easy to understand 

step-by-step video instructions will also be available. Users who are not familiar with cryptocurren-

cies will be given the option of exchanging to fiat money with just a few clicks.

On the platform, the prices will be displayed in both LIVE and in USD, for the convenience of users.

The platform will have an improved system of referrals, providing an opportunity to earn not only for 

the models, but also for the users. Current websites include a single-tier referral program. Thanks to 

the blockchain’s reliability and our automated system, we created a multi-tiered referral program for 

all the people involved without any glitches or time limitations.

Industry facts

The following information has been collected based on the work of the technical support of one of 

the top webcam sites:

The technical support department receives an average of 750 chats per day and receives an 

average of 100 emails with various problems. 

20% of the applications are related to changing the payment method for the models/studios.

Another 20% is a problem when the users purchase tokens - the user performed one of the 

payment methods available but did not receive the tokens.

10% requests are related to deletion of the accounts and personal information from the 

database. All the accounts are possible to recovery.

10% of the applications are related to the uncertainty of the model´s display on the ranking 

page.

10% are related to the problem of not getting models paid out from the webcam payout 

department.

The remaining 30% are technical problems associated with broadcasting and other issues.

On average, there are 250 new model registrations on a top website per day.

80% of them are the new models who never before worked on this particular platform. 

10% of these new models become successful models that work in the future as well.

60-70% of the new models stop working before they can collect the minimal amount for 

withdrawal.

99% of the newly registered male models never collect the minimal amount for withdrawal.

Conclusion

While working on the study, we performed an additional survey among models and users.

The models were asked to specify some of the aspects of the current webcam sites they were not 

content with. High commissions, long waits for payments, doubts about confidentiality and the 

security of their personal data was mentioned.

The users who were presented with similar questions stated their disappointment by the fact that 

the majority of their payments goes to the platform’s owners, not the models. They are also 

concerned about their anonymity and security. They also experience delays when making purchases 

and bad service.

Our project team took the participants’ wishes and growing demand into account, while also 

achieving cuts in expenses by automating business processes and getting rid of unnecessary 

departments.

The LIVE token will be the only possible form of payment on the Live Stars platform. Token emission 

is limited. 70% of the tokens will be in the hands of contributors, while the remaining tokens that are 

unsold during the crowdsale will be burned. 

We are sure that the integration of the latest technological solutions and Live Star’s open-book 

policy will soon become a great advantage in marketing campaigns and will allow the project to take 

a leading position in webcam industry.
