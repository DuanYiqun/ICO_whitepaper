EXECUTIVE​ ​SUMMARY   
 

Introducing Telegraf Money, a mobile messenger with a built-in decentralized          
mobile​ ​bank. 
 
What​ ​is​ ​Telegraf​ ​Money? 

Telegraf’s mission is to bridge the gap between digital and fiat currencies by             
providing a decentralized mobile messenger with built-in blockchain bank -          
Messenger bank that is easy to use and accessible to a wide range of              
demographics. Telegraf will remove any barriers that exist between crypto and           
fiat currencies while making traditional banking services easily accessible through          
Mobile​ ​Banking​ ​Messenger​ ​App.  
 
Telegraf’s features will include a wide range of traditional banking services on top             
of​ ​secured​ ​P2P​ ​messenger!  
 
Telegraf is creating a one of a kind marketplace where its customers are able to               
quickly transfer funds to anyone in the world, make deposits, loan each other             
money all the while having their savings be protected against inflation with            
Telegraf’s​ ​investment​ ​products.  
 
Telegraf already privately raised 12.88 million dollars in investment capital that           
was used to build our entire infrastructure. We are in the process of integrating              
with the Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype APIs/SDK which gives us access to            
a pool of over 2 billion users to fuel our ecosystem and get our 1 Billion Coins in                  
circulation​ ​and​ ​active​ ​usage. 
 
Now we’re ready to push the boundaries of digital banking and take off to a               
whole​ ​new​ ​level.

MOBILE​ ​BANKING 

 
Almost​ ​everything​ ​has​ ​gone​ ​mobile​ ​and​ ​banking​ ​is​ ​no​ ​different.  

For example Somalia and Kenya opted to replace traditional bank branches and            
ATM machines with mobile banking services. This allows a fast majority of the             
population to easily open a bank account with their phone, pay each other             
through​ ​SMS​ ​among​ ​many​ ​other​ ​convenient​ ​features.  

While a lot of money transfer giants such as Western Union are recognized and              
semi-trusted, their high fees and the need for physical locations are inconvenient,            
inefficient and far from being customer friendly. This creates a major advantage            
for other new products with more flexibility and speed that appeal to an overly              
impatient​ ​and​ ​sophisticated​ ​audience.  

Future​ ​steps: 
 

Blockchain is the most revolutionary concept to ever materialize since the           
Internet. 
 
Blockchain is a digital ledger, in which transactions made in bitcoin or another             
cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically, publicly and is immutable.        
Blockchain provides foundation for much faster, efficient and less prone to error            
system​ ​to​ ​provide​ ​traditional​ ​clearinghouse​ ​services​ ​like​ ​ACH​ ​or​ ​wire​ ​transfer.  
This obviously saves time and money to the banks and makes payments instant             
and​ ​cheaper​ ​for​ ​clients.  
 
Moreover, Blockchain’s decentralized structure makes it almost virtually        
impossible and painfully difficult for criminals to commit fraud and scam the            
system. 
 
One of the biggest innovations within the Blockchain world is Smart Contracts. In             
Banking, Smart contracts allow consumers to exchange any stored value such as:            
money, company shares, physical property representation amongst other things,

in a secure, no-conflict manner without a middleman interfering and taking a            
commission​ ​at​ ​every​ ​step.  

In addition to being like a regular contract in defining obligations and exceptions             
around an agreement, the Smart Contract would automatically enforce those          
obligations. 
 
Smart Contracts are inherently transparent and autonomous, which allows buyers          
for example to easily check merchants’ reviews and previous ratings before           
buying​ ​and​ ​also​ ​rate​ ​them​ ​themselves​ ​after​ ​receiving​ ​the​ ​product​ ​or​ ​service.  
 
This creates an environment where trust is automated and adds fluidity to a peer              
to peer ecosystem which dramatically decreases the risk of fraud and helps            
customers pick the best product/service available. That’s the pure definition of:           
Enhanced​ ​Trade​ ​Exchange. 
 
Telegraf, as a mobile messenger bank app, is the answer to that need. It will               
provide a wide range of traditional banking services, support both fiat currencies,            
Cryptocurrencies​ ​and​ ​empower​ ​peer​ ​to​ ​peer​ ​interactions​ ​in​ ​today’s​ ​world. 
 
Although Telegraf acts like a traditional bank, it is deeply rooted into            
decentralized​ ​spirit​ ​of​ ​Blockchain.  
 
The blockchain era gives companies and individuals the power to redefine           
financial services and creates a more trusted, flexible and inclusive space that            
everyone​ ​could​ ​benefit​ ​from.

Decentralized​ ​community 
Almost all Telegraf transactions will be rateable. With every interaction, end users            
will be able to rate each other’s experience. P2P reputation will create a circle of

each​ ​other.  
 

 
 
Telegraf will offer protocol level moderation in case of payment dispute between

to​ ​issue​ ​a​ ​refund​ ​to​ ​either​ ​party. 
 

Cash​ ​is​ ​king 

Telegraf doesn’t aim to create a physical bank or to compete with cash providers              
in​ ​the​ ​traditional​ ​economy.​ ​However​ ​we​ ​are​ ​planning​ ​on​ ​creating: 
 

- Partnership with current brick and mortar businesses to offer cash          
deposit/withdrawal​ ​services  

- Network of agents. In developing countries where infrastructure to handle          
deposits and withdrawals is not yet developed (such as South America),           
Telegraf will offer retailers (such as grocery stores or gas stations) the            
opportunity to be agents for Telegraf, to handle deposits and withdrawals.           
Naturally, each of these agents will have an account with Telegraf to            
facilitate​ ​this​ ​process.

DEBITCOIN​ ​(DBC) 
 

DebitCoin is a cryptocurrency (private internet currency), based on the Ethereum           
structure, that has a value based on the current market valuation. In other words,              
DebitCoin is an entirely decentralized open source worldwide currency, without          
any central authority. No traditional bank or financial institution will be managing,            
controlling or verifying your transactions. ​You Are Now In Total and Private            
Control​ ​of​ ​Your​ ​Financial​ ​Destiny. 

 

DebitCoin is linked to VISA/MasterCard cards which are embedded in the           
messenger, so their owners can download the crypto currency to their virtual or             
plastic cards, without the need for exchanges and intermediaries for cash           
exchange. 

 

DebitCoin​ ​Elements: 

● The DebitCoin​, connects your wallet to the ecosystem, which enables online           
payments, ATM withdrawals and PoS transactions using ERC20 tokens in the

● The DebitCoin is used to pay for the services of the platform itself,             
compensate the ecosystem participants for the services they provide, for          
performing​ ​any​ ​transactions​ ​in​ ​and​ ​out​ ​of​ ​the​ ​system​ ​through​ ​payment​ ​cards; 

● The DebitCoin can be used for any transactions between community          
members, loading of Debit cards linked to the Telegraf.Money messenger, for           
issuing and receiving short-term P2P loans on the Blockchain, creating smart           
deposits, accepting and sending payments between the users of the          
messenger; 

● The DebitCoin's tokens are not subject to inflation, as they are subject to             
redemption by any transaction from VISA/MasterCard to which the token is           
tied,​ ​so​ ​the​ ​total​ ​number​ ​of​ ​tokens​ ​constantly​ ​decreases; 

● The DebitCoin, offers a unique and smooth user experience and puts all the            
pieces​ ​of​ ​the​ ​ecosystem​ ​together;

security​ ​parameters​ ​set​ ​by​ ​the​ ​user. 
 

DebitCoin​ ​and​ ​Telegraf.Money Wallet

POS terminals all around the world without having to worry about any crypto and              
blockchain​ ​mechanics.

Money’s​ ​Status 

The extensive financial background of the team founders lead us to identify three             
main​ ​money​ ​trends​ ​in​ ​today’s​ ​economic​ ​situation.  
 

- First, cash is still the predominant form of money and value exchange,            
especially in developing and emerging economies and most likely not to           
change​ ​within​ ​the​ ​next​ ​decade. 
 

- Second, Electronic and digital versions of money is increasing in popularity           
all​ ​over​ ​the​ ​world. 
 

- Third, we have already started seeing the development of new currencies,           
new money, and new value exchange tools and the future will only enhance             
that. 
 

So let’s go in details and see how we are playing a major role in reshaping the                 
present​ ​and​ ​the​ ​future​ ​of​ ​money.

30% of the tokens are reserved for the remuneration of team members, partners             
and advisors, and can only be sold after the ICO has ended. Sale of these tokens                
will be subject to a minimum value restriction where the sale will only be allowed               
if​ ​current​ ​market​ ​value​ ​is​ ​greater​ ​than​ ​value​ ​established​ ​during​ ​initial​ ​ICO​ ​period. 
 
These tokens are also used to reward partners who create and promote            
applications​ ​within​ ​the​ ​Telegraf.Money​ ​platform.  

3% of the total DebitCoin tokens issued will be used in the framework of              
marketing (including bonuses) and bounty campaigns, to reward participants for          
promoting​ ​tokens​ ​and​ ​platforms​ ​in​ ​social​ ​networks​ ​and​ ​forums. 

To prevent a decline in DebitCoin market value, a monthly sales cap of 10% will be                
applied​ ​to​ ​tokens​ ​issued​ ​for​ ​Marketing​ ​&​ ​Bounty.

Affiliate promotion are temporary in nature and we reserve the right to change             
them​ ​at​ ​any​ ​time,​ ​please​ ​keep​ ​referring​ ​to​ ​our​ ​Updates​ ​in​ ​our​ ​Blog. 
https://blog.telegraf.money/ 
 
We will be announcing on the website multiple promotional events including but            
not limited to Raffles and Prizes to attract more downloads. Either you pay 2$ for               
a​ ​raffle​ ​ticket​ ​or​ ​download​ ​the​ ​app​ ​and​ ​submit​ ​your​ ​member’s​ ​number​ ​to​ ​enter. 
 
We will issue 10 million DebitCoins per 10 million app downloads as a raffle              
promotion. 
 

Why​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing​ ​an​ ​ICO? 
 

There are many reasons why we have chosen to do initial coin offering instead of               
alternative ways to raise money. First, an initial coin offer allows us to get              
onboard participants from different regions but also to incentivize them to           
promote Telegraf’s products by the virtue of usage (network effect) and by            
affiliate marketing and collecting a bounty while doing so. Second, tokens provide            
liquidity since they can be traded on multiple exchanges after the ICO is             
completed.  
 
Participants can liquidate their DebitCoin faster than selling shares in a public            
company. 
 
Through Joint Ventures and Partnerships with Other Messaging Platforms and          
Social Networks, we will incentivize both the platforms and the users to use our              
ecosystem for their financial needs. This is one of the main reasons we are selling               
Debit​ ​Coins​ ​through​ ​the​ ​ICOs.

Proof​ ​of​ ​Message 
 
The​ ​proof​ ​of​ ​sending​ ​the​ ​message,​ ​Proof-of-message​ ​(PoM)​​ ​​is​ ​an​ ​innovative 
method​ ​of​ ​confirming​ ​transactions,​ ​in​ ​which​ ​the​ ​probability​ ​of​ ​the​ ​user​ ​forming​ ​a 
block​ ​in​ ​the​ ​blockchain​ ​is​ ​proportional​ ​to​ ​the​ ​share​ ​that​ ​is​ ​sent​ ​by​ ​that​ ​user​ ​the 
number​ ​of​ ​messages​ ​from​ ​their​ ​total​ ​number. 
This​ ​will​ ​be​ ​an​ ​added​ ​layer​ ​of​ ​rewarding​ ​and​ ​incentivizing​ ​usage​ ​of​ ​the​ ​platform 
every​ ​time​ ​blocks​ ​are​ ​formed​ ​or​ ​validated. 
 
Please​ ​stay​ ​tuned​ ​for​ ​detailed​ ​updates​ ​on​ ​this​ ​new​ ​breakthrough​ ​concept​ ​we​ ​are 
developing.

WHAT’S​ ​NEXT 

 

 

To Fuel The Economy within the Telegraf planet, the first ICO will happen at the               
Dubai​ ​World​ ​Blockchain​ ​Summit​ ​on​ ​the​ ​24​th​​ ​of​ ​October​ ​2017.​ ​More​ ​on​ ​that​ ​later. 

http://dubai.worldblockchainsummit.com/  

It’s difficult to predict and measure all that lies ahead, mostly due to yet untapped               
potential of the blockchain technology. With legacy banks joining the trend and            
new blockchain-based startups we can expect the future of digital banking to            
evolve​ ​in​ ​many​ ​unexpected​ ​ways. 

Once we transition from digitizing traditional banking services to inventing digital           
banking services that suit the blockchain era, we will experience increased           
accessibility and trust, cheaper and faster services and a significantly more           
automated​ ​banking​ ​industry.
