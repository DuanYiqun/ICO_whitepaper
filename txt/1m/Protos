CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This offering memorandum contains statements which, to the extent that they do not recite historical facts, 

constitute forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly 

to historical or current facts and may include the words “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” 

“expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan” or other words or expressions of similar meaning. These 

forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the Issuer about future events. The forward-

looking statements include statements that reflect the Issuer’s beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, 

anticipations and intentions with respect to the use of proceeds of the offering of PRTS Tokens, the Fund’s 

investment strategy, investment thesis, investment criteria, methodology for calculating NAV, intentions and 

expectations with respect to the management and advisors of the Manager, intentions with respect to realization of 
proceeds from investments by the Fund, potential redemptions and buybacks of PRTS Tokens and intentions to 

“burn” such tokens, expected capital reserves of the Fund, expectations about development of cryptocurrencies, 

Blockchain technology and initial coin offerings (“ICOs”), and statements about expected future performance and 

business of the Issuer and the Fund and expected effect of Singapore and Cayman Island tax regulations, and 

expected timing of reporting of NAV and calls for Tokenholders. The Issuer urges you to carefully review this 

offering memorandum, particularly the section “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum, for a more complete 

discussion of the risks of an investment in the PRTS Tokens. Although the Issuer believes that the expectations 

reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Issuer cannot guarantee with respect to the Fund, 

future investments, results and returns on investments, level of activity, performance or achievements, whether any 

PRTS Tokens will be redeemed or the redemption price of any redemption. Many factors discussed in this offering 

memorandum, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, will be important in determining the future 
performance of the Issuer and the Fund. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be 

anticipated from forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the 

inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this offering memorandum as a representation by the Issuer or the Fund 

that its plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking 

statements. The Issuer does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a 

result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PRTS TOKEN OFFERING 

Highlights of Protos Team Experience 

The members of the Protos Cryptocurrency Fund Ltd. (“Protos”) team believe they will be able to create market 
leading returns based on three core factors: 

1. They have a strong background in trading cryptocurrencies with a combined experience of over eleven

years, and were early investors in three of the now top five biggest protocols by market cap (see table

below). The Protos team believes that their ability to identify early stage opportunities is in significant part

grounded in the team’s background of starting and building companies as both operators and investors, and

will continue to lead their expertise in investing in pre-ICO and ICO opportunities.
2. The cryptocurrency and digital asset market is maturing. As this asset class grows, investors will need to

incorporate more sophisticated trading strategies in order to outperform the market. The members of the

Protos team have spent their careers building these strategies in a variety of different asset classes and

together believe they are well positioned to be a leader in this market.

3. As more people look to diversify their holdings into cryptocurrencies, the members of the Protos team

believe that they are presenting a simple way through the PRTS Token for investors to gain indirect

exposure to actively managed portfolios. Protos believes that there is a very limited universe of people who

are both cryptocurrency experts and professional traders who understand the market and can truly balance a

cryptocurrency and digital token portfolio, and, based on their previous experience, the Protos team

believes that they represent that rare combination.

Above all, Protos is designed to enable investors in the PRTS Tokens to indirectly benefit from opportunities 

provided by pre-ICO and ICO and active trading strategies.1

The backgrounds of the members of the Protos team and examples of startups are shown for informational purposes only, and because 
members of the Protos team expect to utilize prior knowledge and experience to invest in digital tokens and cryptocurrencies as part of the 
Protos investment strategy. Past performance should not be relied upon for any reason and is not indicative of future results. Additional 
information regarding experience of the members of the Protos team is available. Losses in Protos may occur, which may have a negative effect 
on the value of the PRTS Tokens. The PRTS Token does not represent or qualify as an interest in the Issuer or in Protos and does not grant any 
equity or voting rights in, or claim against, the Issuer or Protos. Furthermore, the PRTS Token is not, and does not represent or qualify as, a 
fund unit or structured product.

Trading Strategies of the Fund 

Protos is an actively managed hedge fund with an investment strategy of making strategic investments in digital 

tokens and actively managing digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including 

derivatives linked thereto). Protos believes it will be a leader in the field by taking a balanced approach because, in 

addition to investing in new digital tokens at an early stage and executing data informed and human executed trading 

strategies, it will be among the first funds to build what Protos believes will be a robust database of digital token and 

cryptocurrency market data and to use advanced technical trading strategies and, over time, algorithms. Protos, 

through the Issuer, will enable a wide range of qualified investors worldwide to hold PRTS Tokens and thereby 

indirectly get a balanced actively managed exposure to digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency 
investments (and derivatives linked thereto). PRTS Token purchasers are expected to benefit through buybacks 

driven by realizations in the portfolio. 2

Protos Investment Thesis 

The Fund’s objective is to achieve capital appreciation and produce superior risk adjusted returns while 

concurrently seeking to use strategies designed to reduce risk by making strategic investments in digital tokens and 

actively managing digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including derivatives linked 

thereto).  

Protos is among those unlocking what it believes is the second major investing wave in crypto and, once data on 

the market exists, Protos anticipates that the market will see a significant increase in trading strategies focused on 

digital tokens and cryptocurrencies similar to what occurred in the equities markets. Protos expects to help drive this 

second wave with the goal of benefiting PRTS Tokenholders through proprietary crypto trading strategies. The 

Protos investment strategy includes purchasing digital tokens as an investment. Protos expects to use strategies to 

filter and invest in early stage (pre-ICO) opportunities as well as ICOs, conventional trading strategies, and 

increasingly over time, advanced data driven trading strategies where humans use data to trade and to build and train 

algorithms. Protos intends as part of its investment strategy vision to develop a multi-manager strategy in which data 

scientists in the community may contribute to and be rewarded for developing trading strategies.3

that a PRTS Token will appreciate in value. Losses may occur.

OVERVIEW OF THIS OFFERING 

The following is a summary of the principal features of the PRTS Tokens and is taken from, and is qualified in 
its entirety by, the remainder of this offering memorandum. 

PRTS Token .........................................  An ERC20 smart contract digital token representing an indirect fractional 

non-voting economic interest in the sole Class A shares of the Fund, an 

evergreen fund with an investment strategy of making strategic 

investments in digital tokens and actively managing digital tokens, 

cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including 

derivatives linked thereto).  

The Issuer ............................................  PRTS CAM Pte. Ltd., a newly organized Singaporean private limited 

company.  

Underlying Asset ..................................  The Issuer’s only non-cash asset, which will be acquired by the Issuer on 

or around the issuance of the PRTS Token, will be the sole Class A 

shares issued by the Fund. 

Target Amount Offered ........................  This Offering is soft capped at $50,000,000 and hard capped at 

$60,000,0000. 

Price Per Unit .......................................  USD $1.00 per PRTS Token. 

Currencies Accepted .............................  BTC, ETH and USD. Subscribers for PRTS Tokens using USD must 

subscribe for a minimum of $25,000 in PRTS Tokens. 

Offering Deadline .................................  December 15, 2017 (as such date may be extended or earlier closed by
the Issuer in its sole discretion).  

Smart Contract .....................................  The PRTS Tokens will be issued electronically on the ERC20 smart 

contract standard consisting of software code, existing on the Ethereum 

Blockchain, deployed at the address published on TokenHub (“Smart 

Contract”). The software code of this Smart Contract is open source and 

published and can be verified at the address 

https://github.com/PRTSToken/PRTSToken. 

Realization Buybacks; Application of 
Realization Proceeds ............................  

If there are realizations in the Fund’s portfolio, then, within forty-five 
(45) calendar days of the end of each calendar quarter (March 31, June

30, September 30, December 31), an amount equal to the proceeds

received from such realizations (which may be in fiat currency,

cryptocurrency or otherwise) (net of all applicable taxes, fees and

expenses including the Management Fee and after giving effect to the

Carried Interest allocated to the Class B shareholder) (“Proceeds”) shall

be treated as follows:

1. A minimum of 50% of any such Proceeds are expected to be

used for investment in additional portfolio investments, provided

however that any such Proceeds that have been held by the Fund

for more than 18 months following the realization to which they
relate and which have not been used during such period for

investment in additional portfolio investments may be used for

additional purchases of PRTS Tokens in accordance with the

procedure set forth in clause 2 below; and

2. A minimum of 10% of any such Proceeds shall be used by the

Fund to purchase PRTS Tokens on the open market (which may



7 

be done directly by the Fund or by the Issuer) in compliance 

with applicable law. All PRTS Tokens purchased by the Fund or 

the Issuer will be “burnt.” PRTS Tokens will be burnt “on 

chain” for (at least) the first year after closing by sending the 

PRTS Tokens to the address 

0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Thereafter 
the Fund and the Issuer will endeavor to burn PRTS Tokens by 

use of a self-destructing smart contract, by having the PRTS 

Tokens sent to such smart contract then executing the self-

destructing routine over the PRTS Tokens. 

In the event that the Fund makes any cash distributions to the Issuer, the 

Issuer may distribute such amounts to the PRTS Tokenholders by way of 

a repurchase or redemption of PRTS Tokens (“Redemption 

Distributions”) in compliance with applicable law. The Issuer shall be 
required to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with, applicable 

law to use such cash funds solely for the purpose of PRTS Token 

repurchases or redemptions and related expenses. Such distributions to 

the Issuer by the Fund shall be made at the sole discretion of the board of 

directors of the Fund in consultation with the Manager, and distributions 

by the Issuer shall be at the sole discretion of the Issuer. 

Liquidity Buybacks ..............................  If the market price of a PRTS Token (determined to be the average price 
at 3:00 pm Eastern Time over the three largest cryptocurrency exchanges 

by liquidity) drops below 75% of the NAV per PRTS Token based on the 

Fund’s last quarterly NAV report, the Fund and/or the Issuer may, each in 

its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable law, make purchases 

of PRTS Tokens on the open market. Such purchased PRTS Tokens may 

be resold by the Fund and/or by the Issuer in compliance with applicable 

law. Persons in the United States or U.S. Persons acquiring the resold 

PRTS Tokens may be required to hold the PRTS Tokens for one year 

from the date of purchase.  

Fixed Price Offer ..................................  The Fund and/or the Issuer may at any time, after the issuance of the first 

NAV report, offer to repurchase PRTS Tokens at a fixed price notified by 

a notice published on TokenHub with prior disclosure on a minimum of 

thirty days’ notice, and in compliance with applicable law. Such 

purchased PRTS Tokens may be resold by the Fund or by the Issuer in 

compliance with applicable law. Persons in the United States and U.S. 

Persons acquiring such resold PRTS Tokens may be required to hold 

PRTS Tokens for one year from the date of purchase.  

NAV Reporting; Monthly Conference 

Call ......................................................  

During the first year following the closing of this Offering, the Fund’s 

NAV will be reported monthly as at the 30th of each month, within five 

(5) business days of such date. After the first anniversary following the

closing of this Offering, it is expected that the Fund’s NAV will be

reported more frequently than monthly. It is expected that there will also

be a monthly conference call where the Manager will be available to

respond to questions proposed in advance.

Voting Rights .......................................  The PRTS Tokens have no voting, management or control rights as 

described below under the caption “Description of PRTS Tokens.” See 

“Description of PRTS Tokens — Voting,” and “Risk Factors — PRTS 

Tokenholders Will Have No Voting Rights.” 

Distribution Policy ...............................  PRTS Tokens have no distribution or dividend rights. See “Description of 

PRTS Tokens — Distribution Policy,” and “Risk Factors — PRTS 



8 

Tokenholders will have no distribution rights and may have conflicts of 

interest with the Issuer’s shareholder.” Returns of capital to PRTS 

Tokenholders, if any, will occur through open market purchases, a fixed 

price offer (as described above) or repurchases of PRTS Tokens as 

described above under the caption “Realization Buybacks; Application of 

Realization Proceeds,” all of which shall be effected in compliance with 
applicable law. 

Optional Redemption............................  The Issuer may redeem any or all of the PRTS Tokens at any time 

following the date ten years from the date of issue on thirty days’ notice 

at a redemption price equal to the NAV per PRTS Token, as described in 

this offering memorandum under “Description of PRTS Tokens—

Optional Redemption.”  

Regulatory Redemption ........................  The Issuer may at any time redeem all or some of the PRTS Tokens, in 

the Issuer’s discretion, at a redemption price calculated as the lower of (i) 

70% of the market price per PRTS Token (determined to be the average 

price at 3 p.m. Eastern Time over the three largest exchanges by 

liquidity), (ii) the then NAV per PRTS Token or (iii) a per PRTS Token 

price determined from the aggregate amount of the funds available from 

liquidation of the assets of the Fund within the following three (3) month 

period divided by the number of PRTS Tokens, in each case, upon receipt 

of information that the status of the PRTS Tokenholders may cause 
regulatory concern for the Fund, the Issuer or the Manager, as described 

in this offering memorandum under “Description of PRTS Tokens—

Regulatory Redemption.” 

No Liquidation Rights ..........................  Subject to applicable law, the PRTS Tokenholders will have no 

liquidation rights or other claims in the event of the bankruptcy or 

liquidation of either the Fund or the Issuer, but the intention is to use 

commercially reasonable efforts to return available proceeds of a 

bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer (or the Fund, to the extent of 
proceeds distributed to the Issuer) to PRTS Tokenholders if such an event 

occurs. The Fund has no fixed termination date and is under no obligation 

to redeem the PRTS Tokens at any time. 

Listing..................................................  The Issuer intends to list the PRTS Tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. 

We do not currently have any plans to apply for the inclusion of the 

PRTS Tokens in any securities exchange or automated quotation system. 

No Registration Rights and Transfer 

Restrictions ..........................................

residents. The Issuer will have no operations other than holding the Fund’s sole Class A shares and currency and the 

necessary operations of the PRTS Tokens. For more detail, please see “Summary” and “PRTS CAM Pte. Ltd.” 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the PRTS Tokens involves a significant degree of risk. Some of the risks of an investment in 

the PRTS Tokens are described under “Risk Factors,” beginning on page 40. These risks include the following: 

 There can be no assurance that you will receive a return on your investment in PRTS Tokens and you may

lose the full value of your investment.

 The PRTS Tokens are subject to significant transfer restrictions that may adversely impact your ability to

resell the PRTS Tokens and the price at which you may be able to resell them, if at all.



10 

 There is no existing trading market for the PRTS Tokens and there can be no assurance that a secondary

market will develop for the PRTS Tokens. If a secondary market does develop, there can be no assurance

that it will provide the holders with liquidity for their investment or that it will continue for the life of the

PRTS Tokens.

 We have the right to redeem the PRTS Tokens at any time after ten years or earlier upon the occurrence of
certain events. The amount for which we redeem your PRTS Tokens may be below market price or below

the price at which PRTS Tokens are sold in this Offering.

 To the maximum extent provided by law, none of the Manager, the Fund, or the Issuer will owe you any

fiduciary duties and the Issuer shall have no obligation to exercise any rights it has with respect to the Fund.

 Holders of the PRTS Tokens will not be entitled to any voting, distribution or liquidation rights with
respect to the PRTS Tokens, the Issuer or the Fund. The PRTS Token does not represent or qualify as an

interest in the Issuer or the Fund and does not grant any equity or voting rights in, or a claim against, the

Issuer or the Fund. Furthermore, the PRTS Token is not, and does not represent or qualify as, a fund unit or

structured product.

 The tax characterization of the PRTS Tokens is uncertain and a subscriber must seek its own tax advice in
connection with an investment in PRTS Tokens. An investment in the PRTS Tokens may result in adverse

tax consequences to subscribers, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.

It is also possible that the income of the Issuer or the Fund would be subject to significant amounts of

income and/or withholding taxes.

The Issuer and the Fund are not registered with any non-U.S. or U.S. federal, state, provincial or territorial 

securities commission or any other regulatory authority. Accordingly, subscribers in PRTS Tokens will 
generally not have the benefit of the subscriber protections available to subscribers in offerings by registered 

entities. To the extent we are required to register under any applicable securities or other laws, there can be no 

assurance that we will be able to comply in a timely fashion or at all. Any failure to comply with applicable 

laws or regulations may adversely impact our ability to undertake the actions outlined in this offering 

memorandum, our ability to continue operations, the liquidity of the PRTS Tokens and your ability to recover 

your initial investment in the PRTS Tokens. The Manager is expected to file with the U.S. Securities and 

Exchange Commission as an “Exempt Reporting Adviser,” and will file a registration with a self-regulatory 

organization (“SRO”) in Switzerland.

Blockchain technology enables the secure transfer of information and value between unknown actors via the 

Internet. For the first time in history, Bitcoin was the first major implementation of this technology. Today, 

Blockchain technologies are being used by countless individuals, banks, governments, startups, and other 

participants globally. 

At its most simple essence Blockchain technology enables the transfer of things securely inside of “tokens.” For 

example, a Bitcoin is a token. Most implementations of a Blockchain can have tokens which, in most cases, 

investors can purchase. Protos exists to invest in the creation of new Blockchains and to invest in the associated 

tokens. Obviously inherent to Blockchain technology is its online existence. Some of the Internet’s most successful

entrepreneurs and investors, such as Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson, view this iteration of the Internet, 

sometimes referred to as the Internet 2.0, as the third major technological innovation after the PC and the Internet 

itself. We agree.  

This iteration of the Internet also coincides with revolutions in other technologies which are undergoing 

exponential change such as AI, big data, machine learning, cloud computing, and IoT. It has also coincided with the 

advent and adoption of innovations in finance such as crowd funding. Taken together, we think Blockchain 

technology will touch nearly every industry, and we believe it will result in the creation of several hugely valuable 

Blockchains and Blockchain innovating companies. As investors, it is our focus to select the Blockchains which we 

believe: (a) will provide immense value to human kind and thereby dominate their market spaces of the future; and 

(b) accrue value created from the Blockchain in the token we have invested in. As an example, Ethereum was one of

our founders’ earliest investments in the cryptocurrency sphere during its so-called Initial Coin Offering or “ICO”

(sometimes referred to as Initial Token Offerings or Token Generating Events).

The power of the Ethereum Blockchain platform has arguably led to rapid proliferation of new currencies, coins 

or tokens through ICOs. Today there are hundreds of tokens or coins with different uses and that have varying 

market values which are traded with varying degrees of liquidity. The Ether token itself has increased greatly in 

value as the tokens are used to buy new token offerings via the Ethereum Blockchain Network. The average price of 

Ether tokens when they were first released on July 22, 2014 was approximately $0.30 (see blog.ethereum.org) 

against a recent market price of $289.15, which represents a market capitalization of approximately $27.5 billion. It 

is worth noting that it is a feature of a Blockchain network that this type of layer of the technology, sometimes 

referred to as the protocol, on which other applications are built, we believe increases in value as the rate of usage of 

the application is built on top of the protocol layer. This is in contrast to the Internet itself where relatively little 
value has accrued to the essential protocol layers which support it, but almost all value has accrued to data 

applications (such as search engines and social media platforms), which are built on top of the protocol layer (such 

as TCP/IP, SMTP HTTP, etc.). 

We are seeing the increase in value of tokens as a result of this feature. For example, at the start of 2017, the 

combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies at the time stood at a little over $17 billion. Currently, the value of all 

tokens in the industry is valued to be over $135 billion. With a rise of almost 700% in a year, the asset class has 

demonstrated itself to be one of the fastest growing in the world. 

In terms of where we believe the market will evolve, we note that with almost $1 billion in transaction volume 

and a current market cap of $65.8 billion, Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin dominance 

has dropped below 50% as new currencies and tokens are issued on a frequent basis, with ICOs having raised more 

than $2.3 billion year to date. The number of ICOs held per month has been on the rise and the average ticket size 

raised has seen a marked increase. 

Furthermore, in terms of future development of the market, we believe that an important aspect of ICOs is that 

token issuance has the potential to disrupt many industries. Finance in particular we think is likely to be profoundly 

affected as the Blockchain has the power to dramatically lower costs and increase the ease of transactions (we 

understand that approximately 15% of banks are actively working on Blockchain technology globally). We believe 

that the decentralized nature of Blockchain transactions and the ability to incorporate sophisticated smart contracts 

will likely lead to rapid innovation in many fields in ways that are yet to be known, and we believe these will be 

disruptive in areas where a trusted intermediary is currently required (e.g. custodians, trustees, escrow arrangements, 

identity verification). 

We believe that digital tokens issued via ICOs can represent tremendous investment opportunities but their 

sheer number and complexity pose challenges for investors to filter out poorly constructed ICOs and to get access to 

and evaluate the better investment opportunities. As described below under “Investment Thesis,” we believe that the 

combination of the Fund’s strategy, and the experience of the Fund’s management team, position the Fund well to 

deal with these challenges and seek the most suitable investment opportunities.

underlying most ICOs today — together with Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, and Christian, a well-known 

early stage technology investor, will primarily assist in the team’s early protocol selection process.  Anish has been 

working in the security and cryptography area for the past 18 years as a researcher and as a consultant. He is an 

advisor to several blockchain companies including Ripple Labs. Anish will primarily assist the team on security 

matters. 

Fund Strategy 

The Fund seeks to deliver long-term value for PRTS Tokenholders by deploying capital across a broad range of 

digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including derivatives linked thereto), through 

an active investment strategy. By using this strategic approach the Fund will seek to outperform a broad range of 

digital token and cryptocurrency investments. The Fund’s trading and investment strategies may evolve over time, 
but the Fund’s consistent goal is to seek to capture profit opportunities in the digital token and cryptocurrency 

market while limiting trading losses during periods of volatility or general market downturns. The overall aim of the 

active trading strategies component of the portfolio is to produce superior risk-adjusted returns, with a focus on 

controlling risk, by investing in the largest cryptocurrencies by network value (market capitalization) and which 

possess the most trading liquidity (as measured by transaction volume on the major trading exchanges). 

The Fund’s approximate allocation is initially expected to be as follows: 

 35% focused on early stage “initial coin offerings,” and

 65% actively managed strategy for cryptocurrencies, digital tokens and other cryptocurrency investments.

The Manager expects to invest in early stage Blockchain businesses through participation in ICO pre-sales and 

other opportunities to acquire tokens at an early stage.  

The Manager will seek to identify businesses with strong management teams operating in highly scalable areas, 

which use unique technology with vastly differentiated products or services where a clear competitive advantage can 

be demonstrated.  A particular focus will be on highly disruptive distributed applications where Blockchain 

technology can potentially disturb and improve currently successful centralized application incumbents. 

The Manager expects its initial investments to be focused on fintech, identity, e-commerce, payments, social 

media, transportation, energy, and the Internet of Things (“IOT”). However, as the Blockchain environment 

develops and evolves, the Manager also expects to amend its strategy to adapt to any progression and evolution it 

sees in the marketplace. 

The active investing strategies of the Fund will be provided mostly by quantitative trading strategies. 
Quantitative strategies are generally built on historic data and therefore Protos will aim to build additional datasets 

in the space. Quantitative strategies are generally identified by finding a strategy and deciding on trading frequency. 

In order to backtest these strategies, data has to be obtained, the strategy performance is analyzed and biases 

removed. The execution of these strategies are mostly automated by linking to a broker or exchange. Above all, we 

believe risk management determines the optimal capital allocation.  

The Fund will consider, for example, the following active strategies. These strategies will be constantly 

reviewed and, if necessary, improved or replaced:  

 Trend-following

 Market making

 Exchange arbitrage

 News-driven strategies

 Valuation strategies



15 

For quantitative strategies, data sources need to be comparable across a large amount of underlying assets and 

have to be available for an extensive period. Currently, the largely applicable data sources are price, volume, order 

book data on the different exchanges and news on social media. These data sources can be used to build strategies 

like trend-following, market making, exchange arbitrage and news-driven strategies.     

Trend-following is one of the largest active strategies and is only built on price data. Trend-following strategies 
perform particularly well in times of crisis. The strategy proposes to buy an asset, if the return of this asset is 

positive over a pre-set trading period. Hurst, Ooi and Pedersen (2013) suggest to use between 30 and 360 calendar 

days. In fact, Hurst, Ooi and Pedersen (2013) showed that this strategy in fact can be applied to replicate a call-

option. A call-option participates in an increasing market, but limits the downside risk if the market falls. Of course, 

both trend-following and call-options cost a premium and they do not participate in fast price reversals (see Viebig, 

Kallerhoff, Tschunko 2016). The Fund would also use risk mitigating strategies and manage risk-reward using 

option strategies and other derivatives as the market for such instruments develops. 

     Another data source that is available across a large amount of cryptocurrencies is volume and order book data on 
the different exchanges. Additionally, the volatility can be calculated from historic prices. These data sources can be 

used to build market making strategies for the Fund. Market making is based on offering both buy and sell prices for 

an asset in order to profit from the bid-ask spread. This strategy generally calculates a mid-price and places orders to 

buy the asset below the mid-price and sell it above. The aim is to profit from the bid-ask spread independent of the 

market level. This strategy can be considered as a liquidity provision strategy as it matches a buyer and seller, but 

either provides liquidity by buying an asset first or provides the asset first and waits for the liquidity later. The 

spread will be determined by, but not only by, the expected profitability of the strategy, the volatility of the 

underlying asset, the skew of asset’s returns and the liquidity in the Fund.  

     From the order book and volume data on the different exchanges, the Fund will also aim to apply arbitrage 

strategies. Arbitrage strategies seek to profit from price discrepancies between different exchanges. At the current 

stage of the market, arbitrage opportunities still exist on the different exchanges even for major cryptocurrencies. 

Ideally, the strategy seeks to buy an asset at a low price on one exchange and sell it for a higher price on another 

exchange at the same time. Obviously, liquidity and the asset have to be transferred and therefore this strategy can 

be considered as a liquidity provision strategy as well. However, the Fund expects to hold positions to participate in 

the general market performance. Given these positions in the main cryptocurrencies and liquidity, the Fund expects 

to apply arbitrage strategies to aim to generate an additional source of profit. At the same time, the Fund anticipates 
that it will monitor and limit its counterparty risk on the different exchanges as well as the financial risk associated 

with this strategy. 

     News-driven strategies are also applicable to cryptocurrency markets. These strategies are generally based on 

processing of natural language in social media to predict future market movements. Natural language processing is 

based on analyses like text similarity, tagging, parsing, semantics, sentiment analysis and text summarization. The 

Fund will aim to apply natural language processing to trade cryptocurrencies. 

On top of the exemplary strategies above that are built on price, volume, book and news data, the Fund will 
aim to build new data sources for future strategies. One example are strategies built on valuation models. Valuation 

models have not been defined conclusively for cryptocurrencies. However, some ideas stand out and the Fund will 

aim to develop the underlying datasets. 

The idea behind valuation models is to buy an asset at a low price and then wait for other investors to realize 

the higher value of the asset. To measure the value of an asset, for example, it has been suggested to use the 
cryptocurrency PE ratio. This ratio is calculated by network value over the transaction volume. For example, this 

measure tends to fluctuate around 50 for Bitcoin. A ratio below 50 would therefore imply cheap Bitcoin prices and a 

ratio above 50 would indicate expensive Bitcoin prices. However, the transaction volume is not readily available for 

other cryptocurrencies and has to be calculated from each single Blockchain and the transactions on them. Other 

underlying factors could also predict future price movements such as the number of nodes, wallets, github requests 

or users. The Fund will aim to develop these datasets further and test them rigorously for robustness before they are 

applied in the Fund.

Investment Thesis   

The Fund’s objective is to achieve capital appreciation and produce superior risk adjusted returns while 

concurrently seeking to use strategies designed to reduce risk, by making strategic investments in digital tokens and 

actively managing digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including derivatives linked 

thereto). 

The Fund’s investment thesis is based on the following five foundational beliefs that: 

(1) humans and machines need to interact online; 

(2) distributed protocols are a better way in most use cases for these actors to interact and Blockchain 
technologies are enabling the interaction between these parties in new and important ways; 

(3) Blockchain technologies are enabling the creation of decentralized business models with the potential to 
disrupt the centralized application model of current industry incumbents; 

For example, a social media platform or video sharing platform could in the future distribute value 

to its users, thereby disintermediating the value extraction by corporation shareholders. There are 

many examples where such distributed applications will be able to offer significantly more value 

and decision making control to users than a centralized platform. 

(4) to interact in distributed protocols, units of exchange are required. These units of exchange, in the form of 
tokens or coins, provide incentives to the users of these networks and also enables the distribution of the 

value created to that “protocol layer”. This embedded incentive we think is highly disruptive to the existing 
centralized internet business model where to date most of the value created has accrued to the application 

layers built on top of the internet’s protocols. For example, as more people use the Ethereum protocol to 

build and run Blockchain applications, we have seen that the demand for ETH tokens has increased 

dramatically with corresponding increases in the value of the ETH token; and  



 

18 

 

(5) for the next 3 to 4 years from the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Blockchain protocol tokens that 
will offer the greatest opportunities will be those that are the units of exchange on infrastructure 

Blockchains.  

As such, we believe superior risk adjusted returns can be earned by allocating a portion of the Fund portfolio to 

seed stage new tokens and a portion to actively managing tokens from projects that have achieved product market fit 

and have an established base of users validating the efficacy and worth of the underlying protocol. 

Accordingly the Fund expects to invest in and trade a portfolio of digital assets (i.e. cryptocurrencies, tokens, 

coins) at the pre-sale, ICO and post-ICO stage. It is not intended that the Fund will invest in the equity of 

Blockchain companies. The Fund’s proposition is that greater value accrues to tokens, not to shares in Blockchain 

companies. 

Underpinning the investment thesis is our vision to contribute to the development of the cryptocurrency market 

in three ways: 

1. By investing early in teams building new protocols through the purchase of their tokens;  

2. By building the first major datasets in the cryptocurrency market – enabling us to use data driven trading 
strategies. We intend to open source this data to benefit everyone in the market; and 

3. By developing the first multi-manager platform in cryptocurrencies - an interface built on top of our data 
where we can crowd source and reward successful trading strategies. 

Investment Sourcing  

The Manager will filter new protocol investment opportunities using two demonstrated methods: (1) Protos will 

aim to specialize in certain market segments and (2) Protos will seek to co-invest with other experienced early stage 

protocol investors.  

1. Segmentation: Protos believes the fundamental infrastructure on which future  Blockchain applications will 
be built is in its earliest stages. Protos intends to invest almost exclusively in new infrastructure projects 

and developer tools. A good example of such a project is Ethereum, which acts as a computing platform on 

which applications can be programmed and run.   

2. Co-investment: the Protos founders have deep personal relationships with many early stage investors in the 
cryptocurrency and  Blockchain markets and communities, and the team is regularly and actively deepening 

these relationships, including by, for example, hosting intimate gatherings of investors and fund managers 

in the Blockchain space. Protos is in the process of building formal partnerships with venture capital and 

hedge funds whereby Protos and these funds intend to share deal flow and due diligence. Furthermore, the 

Manager will draw on its team of advisors to identify investment opportunities through their deep and 

broad network in the  Blockchain community. For example, Protos advisor Fabian Vogellsteller is the 

distributed application lead at Ethereum and is exposed to numerous talented teams building novel 
protocols. 

Creating value and protecting against losses through active management 

The Fund will also have a highly data driven approach to its active trading investment philosophy. To enable 

active risk management of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, the Manager intends to build an extensive database of 
cryptocurrency market data and, using machine learning analytics, build advanced quantitative trading strategies. 

We believe that as the market matures advanced data sets will also ultimately allow a multi-manager approach 

where it will be possible to source innovative investment strategies from a global community of investors and data 

scientists.  

With the application of quantitative strategies and eventually building a multi-manager platform, the Fund will 

aim to outperform the broad market performance of cryptocurrencies.  



 

19 

 

 In seeking to outperform the market, the Fund will aim to lower risk as assessed by a variety of measures. For 

example, the Fund will aim to apply volatility, Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall as risk measures. These gauges 

will be used to scale and actively manage the portfolio to optimize the risk-return ratio. The Fund will seek to deploy 

active trading strategies and to limit the downside risk by using trend-following strategies. Other strategies seek to 

provide additional sources of profits independent of the market level such as market making and exchange arbitrage 

strategies. Other strategies will include news-driven strategies including natural language processing (NLP) to 
identify market inflexion points and to identify undervalued assets. These strategies are described in more detail in 

“Fund Strategy.”

PROTOS CRYPTOCURRENCY FUND LTD. 

The Fund 

The Fund is a Cayman Islands exempted limited company formed and registered on September 22, 2017. 

The Manager 

The Fund’s investments are managed by Protos Cryptocurrency Asset Management GmbH, a Swiss limited 

liability company. The Manager performs services and activities relating to the management of the Fund’s assets and 

liabilities. The Manager provides its investment management services based on the investment management 

agreement between the Fund and the Manager (the “Management Agreement”).    

NAV Calculation Methodology 

The NAV is calculated as the sum of the estimated fair value of the investments held by the Fund plus cash or 

other assets, minus all liabilities (including the operating expenses, estimated accrued expenses and appropriate 

reserves for contingent liabilities), expressed in USD. The principal amounts of the investments (or the current 

market value of the investments), currency balances, portfolio company token balances and other assets of Fund, the 

value of which is expressed in currency other than USD, shall be valued after taking into account the market rate or 

rates of exchange in force on the applicable valuation date. 

For investments with an active market, fair value is deemed to equal the price of the last market transaction at 

the date and time NAV is calculated, as recorded by the three primary exchanges by volume on which the security or 

use token is traded, or, if no sale was reported on the valuation date on the primary exchange where that security is 

traded, the security will be valued at the last sales price on that exchange when that security was last traded.  

For securities without an active market, fair value is estimated by employing industry standard methods, 

including but not limited to, cost basis, adjusted price of recent investment rounds, entity valuations based on recent 
third-party investments, valuation by an independent securities expert selected by the Fund, valuation of other public 

or private comparable investments and evaluating conditions embedded into Simple Agreement for Future Equity 

notes. 

The above valuation procedures may be modified by the Fund in its sole discretion, if and to the extent that the 

Fund shall determine that such modifications are advisable in order to reflect factors which may impact the value or 

cost of any investment, including (i) restrictions upon marketability (including the suspension or termination of 

trading of any liquid investment in any market), (ii) the expected costs, including brokerage commissions, of 

liquidating any liquid investment or other asset, or (iii) any distribution made with respect to any liquid investment 
or any accruals thereon. 

The NAV per PRTS Token is calculated by dividing NAV by the number of outstanding PRTS Tokens at the 

calculation date rounded to the nearest cent. The number of outstanding PRTS Tokens is calculated as the total 

number of PRTS Tokens of the same series issued, less total number of PRTS Tokens redeemed and/or purchased 

under realization or liquidity buybacks as described in the respective section of this offering memorandum. (see 

“Description of PRTS Token—Realization Buybacks” and “Description of PRTS Token—Liquidity Buybacks”).  

All values assigned to securities, instruments and other assets by the Fund will be final and conclusive. Neither 

the Issuer nor any PRTS Tokenholders shall have the right to audit the valuations made by the Fund. The Fund 

reserves the right to delegate valuation services to the Manager, its affiliates or third parties in the future.  

NAV Reporting 

During the first year following the closing of this Offering, the Fund’s NAV will be reported on a monthly basis 

as at the 30th of each month, within five (5) business days of such date. After the first anniversary following the 

closing of this Offering, it is expected that the Fund’s NAV will be reported more frequently than monthly. It is 

expected that there will also be a monthly conference call where the Manager will be available to respond to 

questions proposed in advance. 



21 

Protos expects to eventually produce real-time reporting of NAV. 

Fund Management Fee  

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager will charge the Fund an annual management fee of 

2.5% of NAV, which will be paid in USD in quarterly increments in advance based on the Fund’s NAV at the 

beginning of the quarter. Ongoing operating expenses of the Fund including legal, accounting and tax expenses will 

be charged to the Fund. 

Carried Interest 

At the end of each calendar quarter and on termination of the Fund, an amount equal to twenty-five percent 

(25%) of the increase, if any, in the Net Asset Value of the Class A shares, after the deduction of all fees and 

expenses, on a high watermark basis, will be allocated from the Class A shares to the Class B shares.  

Investment Criteria 

In addition to the industry focus on digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (and 

derivatives linked thereto), the Fund intends to use the following investment criteria: 

 Investment size: The Fund’s typical investment size per ICO is expected to be 1% to 5% of assets under
management (measured at the time of investment).

 Geographic location: The Fund’s primary focus is on companies that are based in the United States and

Europe. However, due to the global nature of the Blockchain businesses, the Fund will consider

opportunities globally.

 Focus: The Fund will primarily make investments in digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other
cryptocurrency investments, and, if deemed appropriate, derivatives linked thereto.

 Management team: The Fund will look for teams dedicated to growing exceptionally successful businesses

and possessing the prerequisite knowledge, experience and track record to do so. Demonstrated success in

previous ICOs and other undertakings, entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to create value are favorable

attributes.

 Proprietary product or service: The Fund will look for highly differentiated, unique and significantly
superior products and services and companies with clear competitive advantage, as well as growth potential.

The investment criteria described above outlines the general strategy and investment approach of the Fund and, 

given the evolving nature of this investment landscape, may change at any time without notice to or consent from 

the Class A Shareholder or any PRTS Tokenholder. 

For further details on the Manager’s operations please see the sections below entitled “Summary of Principal 

Terms of the Fund” and “Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Responsibilities.”

within twenty (20) business days following the successful closing of this 

Offering in exchange for the proceeds of this Offering (the Issuer initially 
transfers the gross proceeds of the Offering, but subsequently, the 

expense reimbursements pertaining to this Offering will be transferred by 

the Fund directly to the applicable service providers).  

REALIZATION BUYBACKS; 

APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS ......  

If there are realizations in the Fund’s portfolio, then, within forty-five 

(45) calendar days of the end of each calendar quarter (March 31, June

expenses including the Management Fee and after giving effect to the

Carried Interest allocated to the Class B shareholder) (“Proceeds”) shall

be treated as follows:

1. A minimum of 50% of any such Proceeds are expected to be

used for investment in additional portfolio investments, provided

however that any such Proceeds that have been held by the Fund

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES 

Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the Manager and its 

affiliates, including each party’s respective owners, on the one hand, and the Fund, the Issuer and PRTS 

Tokenholders, on the other hand. By acquiring PRTS Tokens each PRTS Tokenholder will be deemed to have 

acknowledged the existence of any such actual or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with 

respect to any liability arising from the existence of any such conflicts of interest. 

The ensuing discussion highlights certain potential conflicts of interest and the procedures that will be used to 

deal with the conflicts, and should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in PRTS Tokens. The 

following is not intended as an exhaustive discussion of all potential conflicts.  

The existence of the Manager’s Management Fee and the Class B shareholder’s entitlement to Carried 

Interest may, given the alignment of interests between the Manager and the Class B shareholder, create an incentive 

for the Manager to make riskier or more speculative investments on behalf of the Fund than would be the case in the 

absence of such performance based arrangements. The members of the Manager’s executive team and other 

members of the Manager will not be required to manage the Manager or the Fund as their sole and exclusive 
function, and are entitled to have other business interests and may engage in other business activities in addition to 

those relating to the Fund. The Manager and the members of the Manager’s executive team may also form and 

devote their time to other future investment funds with activities similar to those of the Fund. The members of the 

Manager’s executive team and the Manager may also have conflicts of interest in allocating time, services and 

functions among the Fund and other business ventures. Conflicts may arise in the allocation of investment 

opportunities and the time of the members of the Manager’s executive team’s time among the Fund, on the one hand, 

and existing investments managed by the members of the Manager’s executive team as well as future funds 

organized by the Manager’s executive team and other business activities, on the other hand. The members of the 

Manager’s executive team are not required to refrain from such management activities or to disgorge profits from 

such activities. Advisors to the Manager and the Fund are not required to present investment opportunities to the 

Manager or the Fund, as applicable, and various conflicts of interest may arise between such advisors, on the one 
hand, and the Manager and/or the Fund, on the other hand. 

To the extent permitted by law, PRTS Tokenholders will not be entitled to any fiduciary duty protections from 

the Issuer or the Fund. Accordingly, PRTS Tokenholders will have very limited, if any, rights of recovery against 

the Issuer or the Fund if such parties engage in gross negligence or act against the interests of the PRTS 

Tokenholders. Furthermore, the Issuer will have no obligation to PRTS Tokenholders to enforce its own rights with 

respect to the Fund and the PRTS Tokenholders will have no power to cause the Issuer to enforce such rights. 

Whenever a potential conflict arises between the Manager or its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Fund, 

the Issuer and/or PRTS Tokenholders, on the other hand, the Manager or if the Manager elects either the board of 

directors of the Fund or the independent committee (if any) of the Fund may resolve that conflict. PRTS 

Tokenholders have no interest in the Issuer or in the Fund and therefore have no direct right of remedy for the 

Manager’s breach of its duties to the Fund. We have adopted these restrictions to allow the Manager or its affiliates 

to engage in transactions with us that would otherwise be prohibited by state-law fiduciary duty standards and to 

take into account the interests of other parties in addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest. 

Without these modifications, the Manager’s ability to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be 

restricted. These modifications are detrimental to the Issuer because they restrict the remedies available to the Issuer 

for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty, including a fiduciary duty, and they 
permit the Manager to take into account the interests of third parties in addition to our interests when resolving 

conflicts of interest. 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any action taken by the Manager to limit its liability or the 

Fund’s liability is not a breach of the Manager’s fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable 

terms without the limitation on liability. PRTS Tokenholders will have no right to enforce obligations of the 

Manager under agreements with the Fund. Any agreements between the Fund on the one hand, and the Manager and 

its affiliates on the other, will not grant PRTS Tokenholders, separate and apart from the Issuer and the Fund, the 
right to enforce the obligations of the Manager and its affiliates in our favor. Contracts between the Fund, on the one 



27 

hand, and the Manager and its affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of arm’s length negotiations. Similarly 

the terms of the Class A shares to be acquired by the Issuer will not be the result of arm’s length negotiations. 

The Manager will not, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be in breach of its obligations to the 

Fund if the resolution of the conflict relating to any breach or alleged breach is: 

 approved by the board of directors or an independent committee appointed to consider such conflict,

although the Manager is not obligated to seek such approval;

 on terms which are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the Fund than those generally being provided to
or available from unrelated third parties; or

 fair and reasonable to the Fund, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties

involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Fund.

The Manager is not required to seek the approval of such resolution from the Fund’s board of directors or an 
independent committee or from the Issuer. If the Manager does not seek approval from the Fund’s board of directors 

or an independent committee and it in good faith determines that the resolution or course of action taken with 

respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the second and third bullet points above, 

then it will be presumed that in making its decision the Manager acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought 

by or on behalf of us or any other person, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden 

of overcoming such presumption. Unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in the Management 

Agreement, the Manager or the Fund’s board of directors or an independent committee may consider any factors it 

determines in its sole discretion to consider when resolving a conflict. The Manager will be conclusively presumed 

to be acting in good faith if the Manager subjectively believes that the determination made or not made is in the best 

interests of the Fund. 

The Management Agreement allows the Manager to determine in its sole discretion any amounts to pay itself or 

its affiliates for any services rendered to the Fund. The Manager or its affiliates will provide certain services to the 

Fund, the fees of which will be paid by the Fund. The Manager may also enter into additional contractual 

arrangements with any of its affiliates on the Fund’s behalf. Neither the Management Agreement nor any of the 

other agreements, contracts and arrangements between the Fund on the one hand, and the Manager and its affiliates 

on the other, are or will be the result of arm’s length negotiations. The Manager will determine the terms of these 

transactions so long as such arrangements are fair and reasonable to the Fund. The Manager and its affiliates will 

have no obligation to permit the Fund to use any facilities or assets of the Manager and its affiliates, except as may 
be provided in contracts entered into specifically dealing with such use. There will not be any obligation on the 

Manager and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind. 

The Issuer may exercise its right to redeem PRTS Tokens or repurchase PRTS Tokens in accordance with 

applicable law. The Manager may, at its discretion, purchase PRTS Tokens on its own behalf or on behalf of its 

affiliates. The Manager may use its own discretion, free of fiduciary duty restrictions to the maximum extent 

permitted by applicable law, in determining whether to exercise these rights. 

The Issuer is a party to an engagement letter agreement with Argon Advisors with respect to compensation and 

indemnification for Argon Advisors for conducting this Offering. From time to time, the Manager, its personnel or 

affiliates may enter into additional agreements with the Issuer, Argon Advisors or their affiliates related to the PRTS 

Tokens, this Offering or other matters. To the extent the Manager, any of its personnel or affiliates were to invest in 

the Issuer or any of its affiliates in the future, such future agreements may be negotiated among related parties. To 

the extent permitted by law, none of the Issuer, Argon Advisors, the Fund or the Manager will be required to 

disclose the nature of any future agreements or relationships among themselves or their affiliates to PRTS 

Tokenholders. 

The PRTS Tokens are not, and do not represent or qualify as, a fund unit or structured product. PRTS 

Tokenholders have no equity or voting rights in, claim against, or other management or control rights in either the 

Issuer or the Fund. The Issuer has no voting rights or other management control rights in the Fund. Accordingly, for 

the foreseeable future, the Fund’s board of directors in consultation with the Manager, and the Manager to the extent 

provided for in the Management Agreement, will control decisions for the Fund that in other companies would 



28 

require stockholder approval, including significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of its 

companies or its assets. 

Although the Issuer does not intend to conduct any activity other than a one-time issuance of the PRTS Tokens, 

administering the Smart Contract and exercising rights as a shareholder of the Fund, conflicts of interest between the 

Issuer and the PRTS Tokenholders may arise. The Issuer’s directors will control the Issuer’s decisions and actions 

and the PRTS Tokenholders will have no voting rights or other ability to influence the decisions or actions taken by 

the Issuer. 

Unfavorable developments or characteristics of any of the above circumstances could adversely affect the 

Issuer’s business, the Fund’s business or the functionality or value of the PRTS Token. 

The foregoing conflicts do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the conflicts involved in investing in 

the PRTS Tokens. Potential subscribers are urged to read this entire offering memorandum and consult their 

advisors before making a determination whether to invest in PRTS Tokens.

PRTS CAM PTE. LTD. 

Business

purpose of holding the sole issued Class A shares in the Fund. The Issuer has no prior operating history, and is 

managed by its directors which are appointed by the Issuer’s shareholders.  

The Fund will pay the annual fees for ongoing operational, accounting, and administration services relating to 
the Issuer. In addition, the Fund will allocate a portion of the gross proceeds of the Offering to Argon Advisors for 

services in connection with this Offering. From time to time, Argon Advisors or one of its affiliates may provide 

additional services to the Fund, the Manager or another of their affiliates, for which compensation for Argon will be 

negotiated on an arm’s length basis.  

Strategy 

The Issuer’s strategy is to monitor and implement the terms of the Smart Contract for the PRTS Tokens and 

hold the sole issued Class A shares of the Fund.

USE OF PROCEEDS 

The gross proceeds of this Offering will be transferred to the Fund, which will in exchange issue to the Issuer 
the sole issued Class A shares of the Fund at an issue price of $1000 per Class A share. Subsequently, the expense 

reimbursements pertaining to this Offering will be transferred by the Fund directly to the applicable service 

providers, leaving the Fund with the net proceeds. The Fund intends to use such gross proceeds to pay offering 

expenses (including compensation to Argon Advisors and legal expenses in connection with this Offering) and to 

invest predominantly in digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (and derivatives linked 

thereto). North Capital Private Securities, a member of FINRA/SIPC, has been appointed as placement agent for the 

offering of these securities and will receive transaction fees based upon the successful placement of securities for the

DESCRIPTION OF PRTS TOKENS 

The PRTS Tokens are ERC20 smart contract digital tokens representing an indirect fractional non-voting 

economic interest in the Issuer’s sole asset, the sole Class A shares in the Fund. There is an aggregate number of up 

to 60,000,000 PRTS Tokens offered in this Offering. The PRTS Tokens are not, and do not represent or qualify as, a 

fund unit or structured product. The PRTS Tokens have no equity, voting, management or control, distribution, 

preemptive or conversion rights. Redemption or buyback rights are only exercisable by the Issuer or the Fund.  

Smart Contract 

The PRTS Tokens will be issued electronically on the ERC20 smart contract standard consisting of 

software code, existing on the Ethereum Blockchain, deployed at the address published on TokenHub (“Smart 

Contract”). The software code of this Smart Contract is open source and published and can be verified at the address 

https://github.com/PRTSToken/PRTSToken. 

Realization Buybacks 

If there are realizations in the Fund’s portfolio, then, within forty-five (45) calendar days of the end of each 

calendar quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31), an amount equal to the proceeds received from 

such realizations (which may be in fiat currency, cryptocurrency or otherwise) (net of all applicable taxes, fees and 

expenses including the Management Fee and after giving effect to the Carried Interest allocated to the Class B 

shareholder) (“Proceeds”) shall be treated as follows:  

1. A minimum of 50% of any such Proceeds are expected to be used for investment in additional portfolio

investments, provided however that any such Proceeds that have been held by the Fund for more than 18

months following the realization to which they relate and which have not been used during such period for

investment in additional portfolio investments may be used for additional purchases of PRTS Tokens in

accordance with the procedure set forth in clause 2 below; and

2. A minimum of 10% of any such Proceeds shall be used by the Fund to purchase PRTS Tokens on the open

market (which may be done directly by the Fund or by the Issuer) in compliance with applicable law. All

PRTS Tokens purchased by the Fund or the Issuer will be “burnt.” PRTS Tokens will be burnt “on chain”

for (at least) the first year after closing by sending the PRTS Tokens to the address

0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Thereafter the Fund and the Issuer will endeavor to
burn PRTS Tokens by use of a self-destructing smart contract, by having the PRTS Tokens sent to such

smart contract then executing the self-destructing routine over the PRTS Tokens.

In the event that the Fund makes any cash distributions to the Issuer, the Issuer may distribute such amounts to 

the PRTS Tokenholders by way of a repurchase or redemption of PRTS Tokens in compliance with applicable law. 

The Issuer shall be required to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with, applicable law to use such cash 

funds solely for the purpose of PRTS Token repurchases or redemptions and related expenses. Such distributions to 

the Issuer by the Fund shall be made in the sole discretion of the board of directors of the Fund in consultation with 

the Manager, and distributions by the Issuer shall be at the sole discretion of the Issuer. 

Liquidity Buybacks 

If the market price of a PRTS Token (determined to be the average price at 3:00 pm Eastern Time over the 

three largest cryptocurrency exchanges by liquidity) drops below 75% of the NAV per PRTS Token based on the 

Fund’s last quarterly NAV report, the Fund and/or the Issuer may, each in its sole discretion and in compliance with 
applicable law, make purchases of PRTS Tokens on the open market. Such purchased PRTS Tokens may be resold 

by the Fund and/or by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law. Persons in the United States or U.S. Persons 

acquiring the resold PRTS Tokens may be required to hold the PRTS Tokens for one year from the date of purchase. 



 

35 

 

Fixed Price Offer 

The Fund and/or the Issuer may at any time, after the issuance of the first NAV report, offer to repurchase 
PRTS Tokens at a fixed price notified by a notice published on TokenHub with prior disclosure on a minimum of 

thirty days’ notice, and in compliance with applicable law. Such purchased PRTS Tokens may be resold by the Fund 

or by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law. Persons in the United States and U.S. Persons acquiring such 

resold PRTS Tokens may be required to hold PRTS Tokens for one year from the date of purchase.  

Distribution Policy 

PRTS Tokens have no distribution or dividend rights. See “Description of PRTS Tokens — Distribution Policy,” 

and “Risk Factors — PRTS Tokenholders will have no distribution rights and may have conflicts of interest with the 

Issuer’s shareholder.” Returns of capital to PRTS Tokenholders, if any, will occur through open market purchases, a 

fixed price offer (as described above) or repurchases of PRTS Tokens as described above under the caption 

“Description of PRTS Tokens — Realization Buybacks,” all of which shall be effected in compliance with 

applicable law. 

Voting 

The PRTS Tokens have no voting, management or control rights as discussed below under the caption “Risk 

Factors — PRTS Tokenholders Will Have No Voting Rights.”  

Optional Redemption 

After a period of ten years from the issue date, at any time, upon not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty 

(60) days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem any or all of the PRTS Tokens at any time following the date ten years 

from the date of issue on thirty days’ notice at a redemption price equal to the NAV per PRTS Token. 

In the event of such optional redemption, the Issuer will issue a notice of redemption published through the 
TokenHub platform at least thirty (30) and not more than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the date fixed for 

redemption. On or before a redemption date, the Issuer will deposit with TokenHub ETH, or other high liquidity 

cryptocurrency determined by the Issuer, if deemed necessary by the Fund, sufficient to pay the redemption price of 

the PRTS Tokens. If less than all of the PRTS Tokens are to be redeemed, the PRTS Tokens to be redeemed shall be 

selected by the Issuer on a pro rata basis, subject to “—Subscriber Allocation” below. The actual redemption of the 

PRTS Tokens will be effected by the PRTS Tokens being “burnt” on the Blockchain.  

The actual redemption of the PRTS Tokens will be effected by the PRTS Tokens being “burnt” on the 

Blockchain for (at least) the first year after closing by sending the PRTS Tokens to the address 
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Thereafter Protos will endeavor to burn PRTS Tokens by use 

of a self-destructing smart contract, by having the PRTS Tokens sent to this smart contract and execute the self-

destructing routine over the PRTS Tokens. 

Regulatory Redemption 

The Issuer may at any time redeem all or some of the PRTS Tokens, in the Issuer’s discretion, at a redemption 

price calculated as the lower of (i) 70% of the market price per PRTS Token (determined to be the average price at 3 

p.m. Eastern Time over the three largest exchanges by liquidity), (ii) the then NAV per PRTS Token or (iii) a per 

PRTS Token price determined from the aggregate amount of the funds available from liquidation of the assets of the 

Fund within the following three (3) month period divided by the number of PRTS Tokens, in each case, upon receipt 

of information that the status of the PRTS Tokenholders may cause regulatory concern for the Fund, the Issuer or 

the Manager.  

In the event of such optional regulatory redemption, the Issuer will issue a notice of redemption published 
through the TokenHub platform at least one (1) and not more than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the date fixed for 

redemption. On or before a redemption date, the Issuer will deposit with TokenHub ETH, or other high liquidity 

cryptocurrency determined by the Issuer, if deemed necessary by the Fund, sufficient to pay the redemption price of 

the PRTS Tokens. If less than all of the PRTS Tokens are to be redeemed, the PRTS Tokens to be redeemed shall be 



 

36 

 

selected by the Issuer on a pro rata basis, subject to “—Subscriber Allocation” below. The actual redemption of the 

PRTS Tokens will be effected by the PRTS Tokens being “burnt” on the Blockchain.  

No Liquidation Rights 

Subject to applicable law, the PRTS Tokenholders will have no liquidation rights or other claims in the event of 

the bankruptcy or liquidation of either the Fund or the Issuer, but the intention is to use commercially reasonable 

efforts to return available proceeds of a bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer (or the Fund, to the extent of 

Proceeds distributed to the Issuer) to PRTS Tokenholders if such an event occurs. The Fund has no fixed termination 

date and is under no obligation to redeem the PRTS Tokens at any time. 

Listing 

The Issuer intends to list the PRTS Tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. We do not currently have any plans to 

apply for the inclusion of the PRTS Tokens in any securities exchange or automated quotation system.  

Fees 

The Manager will charge the Fund an annual management fee of 2.5% of NAV, which will be paid in USD 

in quarterly increments in advance based on the Fund’s NAV at the beginning of each quarter. Ongoing operating 

expenses of the Fund including accounting, legal and tax expenses will be charged to the Fund.  
 

At the end of each calendar quarter and on termination of the Fund, amount equal to twenty-five percent 

(25%) of the increase, if any, in the Net Asset Value of the Class A shares, after the deduction of all fees and 

expenses, on a high watermark basis, will be allocated from the Class A shares to the Class B shares.   

Subscriber Allocation 

Within the territory of the United States, the PRTS Tokens will only be available to purchase by up to a 

maximum of 99 verified “accredited investors” (as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act) that are U.S. 

Persons. In the event of any redemption, PRTS Tokens held by a maximum of 99 U.S. Persons will be redeemed. In 

any such redemption, U.S. Persons who purchased PRTS Tokens in this Offering may, in the Issuer’s discretion, 

receive priority in being redeemed. The selected U.S. Persons will be notified that they have been selected on or 

about the date 15 calendar days before redemption. U.S. Persons not notified will not receive any funds on 

redemption. Any U.S. Person offered PRTS Tokens by a Non-U.S. Person following this Offering are warned such 

transfer is not permitted pursuant to the transfer and resale restrictions applicable to the PRTS Tokens and that any 
such transfer or sale may result in the loss of the full value of their investment, including that such PRTS Tokens 

may not be redeemed. U.S. Persons permitted to purchase PRTS Tokens will be required to maintain their PRTS 

Tokens on TokenHub until the first anniversary of the issuance of the PRTS Tokens, and will be required to make 

undertakings to TokenHub that they will not sell to any U.S. Person unless they sell all of their PRTS Tokens within 

the territory of the United States. 

It is understood and agreed that the Issuer shall have the sole right, at its complete discretion, to accept or reject 

subscriptions for PRTS Tokens, in whole or in part, for any reason and that the same shall be deemed to be accepted 

by the Issuer only when PRTS Tokens are issued. Subscriptions need not be accepted in the order received, and the 
PRTS Tokens may be allocated among subscribers who subscribed early in the offering period and significant orders 

may be given priority. 

Currencies and Exchange Rates 

The currency of the PRTS Token will be USD and the price per PRTS Token will be USD $1.00. Subscribers 
can subscribe for PRTS Tokens in BTC, ETH and USD. Subscribers for PRTS Tokens using USD must subscribe 

for a minimum of $25,000 in PRTS Tokens. The Issuer intends to carefully monitor its cash needs and convert the 

proceeds of this Offering in BTC or ETH in what it believes is a prudent fashion on an as needed basis. The Issuer 

has engaged North Capital Private Securities Corporation as an escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”) to hold USD 

funds tendered by subscribers. In the event the Issuer terminates this Offering or the Issuer does not accept a 

particular subscription, any USD tendered by potential subscribers will be promptly returned by the Escrow Agent 



 

37 

 

net of the outgoing wire fees charged by the Escrow Agent’s banking institution. In order to calculate the number of 

PRTS Tokens that is due to BTC and ETH subscribers, an exchange rate will be set daily during the presale and 

public sale taken as an average of three major exchanges. Subscribers will be alerted to the closing and whether they 

were successful in subscribing by email and an update to their accounts on the TokenHub platform at 

https://tokenhub.com. 

Unclaimed Funds 

The Issuer will attempt to return unclaimed ETH, BTC or other cryptocurrencies from subscriptions or a 

redemption by email invitation to the email address given by subscribers on https://tokenhub.com, which invitation 

will contain a request to the subscriber to provide the instructions where the returned funds should be sent. If the 

subscriber does not respond for a period of 60 days following an email requesting instructions for a refund, the funds 
shall be deemed to become the property of the Issuer. 

Form of Ownership 

The PRTS Token is a digital token on the Ethereum Blockchain with an ability to execute code (smart contract). 

Within twenty (20) business days of the successful closing of the Offering, all digital tokens issued to subscribers 
will be deposited into Ethereum wallets controlled by TokenHub and TokenHub’s users’ accounts will be updated 

with the number of PRTS Tokens issued to them, the ultimate record of which will be kept in a database maintained 

by TokenHub showing its users’ holdings. Subject to restrictions on the PRTS Tokenholders discussed in this 

offering memorandum, PRTS Tokenholders may instruct TokenHub through their user account and direct the PRTS

CERTAIN SINGAPORE TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS 

The statements below are general in nature and are based on certain aspects of tax laws in Singapore and 
administrative guidelines issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore in force as of the date of this offering 

memorandum and are subject to any changes in such laws or administrative guidelines or the interpretation of those 

laws or guidelines, occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. Neither these 

statements nor any other statements in this offering memorandum are intended or are to be regarded (1) as advice on 

the tax position of any PRTS Tokenholder or of any person acquiring, selling or otherwise dealing with the PRTS 

Tokens or on any tax implications arising from the acquisition, sale or other dealings in respect of the PRTS Tokens, 

(2) as an offer to issue, sell, dispose or transfer, or an invitation for subscription, purchase or acquisition of, PRTS 

Tokens, to any person in Singapore, or (3) as implying that PRTS Tokens may be subscribed, purchased or acquired 

by any person in Singapore, or that any person in Singapore is permitted to so subscribe, purchase or acquire PRTS 

Tokens, whether pursuant to this Offering or from any other person. The statements made herein do not purport to 

be a comprehensive or exhaustive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to 

purchase, own or dispose of the PRTS Tokens and do not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all 
categories of subscribers. Prospective PRTS Tokenholders are advised to consult their own professional tax advisers 

as to Singapore or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership of or disposal of the PRTS Tokens, 

including the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws to which they are subject. It is emphasized that neither the 

Fund, the Manager or the Issuer, nor any other persons involved in this Offering accepts responsibility for any tax 

effects or liabilities resulting from the subscription, purchase, holding or disposal of the PRTS Tokens. 

Income Tax 

Under current Singapore income tax laws, gains or profits of an income nature which are sourced in Singapore 

or which are sourced outside Singapore but are received in Singapore will be subject to Singapore income tax, 

unless otherwise exempt under the Singapore Income Tax Act (Cap. 134 of Singapore). 

There is generally no tax on capital gains in Singapore. Holders that acquire PRTS Tokens for long-term 

investment purposes may therefore enjoy a capital gain from the disposal of the PRTS Tokens which is not subject 
to Singapore income tax. Holders that acquire and dispose of PRTS Tokens in the ordinary course of their trade or 

business will be taxed on the gains or profits derived from trading in or carrying on a business in respect of PRTS 

Tokens. 

Whether gains or profits from the disposal of PRTS Tokens are regarded as income or capital gains depends on 

the facts and circumstances of each case. Factors such as intention, frequency of transactions, and holding periods 

are considered when determining if such gains or profits are taxable. 

Goods and Services Tax  

The supply of PRTS Tokens is likely to be regarded as a standard-rated supply for which a Goods and Services 

Tax (“GST”) at the rate of 7% is chargeable on such supply which is made in Singapore by a GST-registered person 

or a person who is liable to register for GST in the course or furtherance of that person’s business, unless such 

supply is made to a person belonging outside Singapore for which the supply may be zero-rated at 0% GST. 



 

40 

 

CERTAIN CAYMAN ISLANDS TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS  

There is, at present, no direct taxation in the Cayman Islands and interest, distributions and gains payable to the 
Fund will be received free of all Cayman Islands taxes. The Fund is registered as an “exempted limited company” 

pursuant to the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands (as amended). The Fund has applied for, and expects to 

receive an undertaking from the Financial Secretary of the Cayman Islands to the effect that, for a period of 20 years 

from the date of the undertaking, no law that thereafter is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be 

levied on profits or income or gains or appreciations, shall apply to the Fund, or to any shareholder thereof, in 

respect of the operations or assets of the Fund or the shares of a shareholder therein.

RISK FACTORS 

Investing in the PRTS Tokens involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described 
below and the risks with respect to the Issuer, the PRTS Token and cryptocurrency exchanges and the other 

information in this offering memorandum. There can be no assurance that PRTS Tokenholders will be able to 

receive a return of their capital or any returns on their investment.  

PRTS Token Risks 

No assurance of investment return.  

The Fund cannot provide assurance that it will be able to choose, make and realize investments in any particular 

company or portfolio of companies or in cryptocurrency investments. There is no assurance that the Fund will be 

able to generate returns on its investments or that any returns will be commensurate with the risks of investing in the 

type of companies and transactions described herein. Furthermore, there is no assurance that if the Fund does 

achieve returns on its investments, such returns will either be reflected in the trading price of PRTS Tokens or that 

PRTS Tokenholders will realize any of such returns. There can be no assurance that expected returns for the PRTS 

Tokenholders will be achieved, or that they will receive a return of their invested capital. An investment in PRTS 
Tokens should only be considered by persons who can afford a loss of their entire investment. The Fund’s 

investments, by their nature, involve a high degree of financial risk. Such investments may expose the Fund’s assets 

to the risks of material financial loss, which may in turn indirectly adversely affect the trading price of PRTS Tokens 

and the availability of funds for repurchases or redemptions of PRTS Tokens. 

The PRTS Tokens are subject to significant transfer restrictions.  

The PRTS Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state or the 
securities laws of any other jurisdiction and therefore cannot be resold, except as described in the section entitled 

“Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum. Persons in the United States and U.S. Persons who purchase 

PRTS Tokens will be required to maintain their PRTS Tokens on TokenHub for a period of one year from the 

issuance of the PRTS Tokens and will be required to make undertakings to TokenHub that they will not sell to any 

other U.S. Person unless they sell all of their PRTS Tokens to a U.S. Person. Non-U.S. Persons holding PRTS 

Tokens will only be permitted to resell or transfer such PRTS Tokens to other Non-U.S. Persons in accordance with 

Regulation S under the Securities Act and in compliance with all other applicable law. These restrictions may 

adversely impact your ability to resell the PRTS Tokens or the price at which you may be able to resell them, if at all. 

PRTS Tokens are not redeemable at the option of the holder and PRTS Tokenholders will not have the right to 
withdraw their capital. It is not contemplated that the PRTS Tokens will ever be registered under the Securities Act 

or any other securities laws. Each PRTS Token subscriber will be required to represent that it is a qualified investor 

under applicable securities laws and that it is acquiring PRTS Tokens for investment purposes and not with a view to 

resale or distribution. Further, each PRTS Tokenholder must represent that it will only sell or transfer its PRTS 

Tokens in accordance with the restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum and 

in a manner permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Consequently, PRTS Tokenholders must be prepared to 

bear the risk of an investment in PRTS Tokens for an extended period of time. 

There is no existing trading market for the PRTS Tokens and an active trading market may not develop. 

The PRTS Tokens are a new issue of digital tokens for which there is no established public market. Although 

we intend to list the PRTS Tokens on several cryptocurrency exchanges, there can be no assurance that such 

exchanges will accept the listing of PRTS Tokens or maintain the listing if it is accepted. There can be no assurance 

that a secondary market will develop or, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the holders with 

liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life of the PRTS Tokens. The liquidity of any market for the 

PRTS Tokens will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the number of PRTS Tokenholders; (ii) the Fund’s 

performance and financial condition; (iii) the market for similar digital tokens; (iv) the interest of traders in making 
a market in the PRTS Tokens; (v) regulatory developments in the digital token or cryptocurrency industries and (vi) 

legal restrictions on transfer. 

The digital token market is a new and rapidly developing market which may be subject to substantial and 

unpredictable disruptions that cause significant volatility in the prices of digital tokens. There is no assurance that 



 

42 

 

the market, if any, for the PRTS Tokens will be free from such disruptions or that any such disruptions may not 

adversely affect an PRTS Tokenholder’s ability to sell its PRTS Tokens. Therefore, there is no assurance that PRTS 

Tokenholders will be able to sell PRTS Tokens at a particular time or that the price received upon sale will be 

favorable. 

Holders of PRTS Tokens will have no voting, management or control rights and may have conflicts of interest with 

the Issuer’s shareholders. 

PRTS Tokens have no voting, management or control rights or other management or control rights in neither 

the Issuer nor the Fund and the Issuer has no voting rights or other management or control rights. Accordingly, the 

Manager will control decisions for the Fund that in other companies would require stockholder approval, including 

any significant corporate transactions, or the election to liquidate or terminate the Fund. 

PRTS Tokenholders will have no liquidation rights. 

Upon a liquidation, bankruptcy or other dissolution of the Fund, PRTS Tokenholders will not be entitled to 

liquidation rights or other claims, although the Fund and the Issuer intend to use commercially reasonable efforts to 

return any available proceeds following a liquidation, bankruptcy or other dissolution of the Issuer (or the Fund, to 
the extent of Proceeds distributed to the Issuer) to PRTS Tokenholders if such an event occurs. Furthermore, the 

Fund has no fixed termination date. 

Repurchase or redemption of PRTS Tokens. 

The PRTS Tokenholders do not have the right to compel the Issuer or the Fund to redeem the PRTS Tokens. 
The Fund may, however, at its discretion purchase outstanding PRTS Tokens from time to time and the Issuer has 

the option at its discretion to redeem PRTS Tokens and purchase PRTS Tokens in accordance with applicable law as 

described in this offering memorandum. The Board of Directors, or the Manager on behalf of the Fund, may allocate 

funds to the Fund for the open-market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in PRTS Tokens from time to 

time when deemed to be in the best interest of the Fund or the Issuer respectively. The Issuer will have no funds 

apart from those provided by the Fund available for the repurchase or redemption of PRTS Tokens. The Board of 

Directors may or may not decide to return any funds to the Issuer for the repurchase or redemption of or any other 

distribution on the PRTS Tokens.  

Furthermore, the Issuer has the right, at its discretion, to redeem the PRTS Tokens after ten years or earlier upon 

the occurrence of certain regulatory events. The amount for which the Issuer redeems your PRTS Tokens in these 

circumstances may be below market price or the ICO price and may adversely impact your return on your 

investment. In addition, the Issuer will redeem PRTS Tokens from a maximum of 99 U.S. Persons with redemption 

priority given to the (up to) 99 U.S. Persons who purchased their PRTS Tokens in this Offering. If more than 99 U.S. 

Persons present PRTS Tokens for redemption some of such persons will not receive any funds in redemption of their 

PRTS Tokens, which may result in a loss of their full investment amount. U.S. Persons acquiring PRTS Tokens 

following this Offering are strongly encouraged not to acquire PRTS Tokens from Non-U.S. Persons and to ensure 

that any U.S. Person from whom they acquire PRTS Tokens has not resold or otherwise transferred PRTS Tokens to 

any additional U.S. Persons.  

In addition, the Fund and/or the Issuer may at any time after the issuance of the first NAV report, at their 

discretion, offer to repurchase PRTS Tokens at a fixed price notified by a notice published on TokenHub, with at 

least thirty (30) days’ prior notice, in accordance with applicable law. Such purchased PRTS Tokens can be sold 

again by the Fund or the Issuer in accordance with applicable law, subject to an applicable exemption from 

registration under applicable securities laws. U.S. Persons acquiring such resold PRTS Tokens may be required to 

hold PRTS Tokens for one year from the date of purchase. After ten (10) years from the issue date, at any time, with 

no less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days’ notice, the Fund may direct the Issuer to redeem some or all of 

the PRTS Tokens at a NAV redemption price. Redemptions will be made in ETH or other cryptocurrency 
determined by the Board of Directors in consultation with the Manager, if deemed necessary by the Board of 

Directors in consultation with the Manager and/or the Issuer.

Regulatory Risks 

Developing regulatory regimes.  

Regulation of tokens (including the PRTS Tokens) and token offerings such as this, cryptocurrencies (including 

Ether), Blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges are currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly 

evolve, and vary significantly among non-U.S. or U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and are subject to 

significant uncertainty. Some of the companies in which the Fund invests may operate in highly regulated industries. 

Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States, China, Singapore and in other countries are currently 

considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact 

the Fund’s ability to invest, or the Fund’s portfolio companies’ ability to gain market share. Failure by the Manager, 

the Fund, the Issuer, Argon Advisors or the Fund’s portfolio companies or their representatives to comply with any 
laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to 

change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.  

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact 

the Fund’s ability to earn returns on investments, the value of the currency in which PRTS Tokens may be redeemed 

or otherwise make distributions on PRTS Tokens, the liquidity and market price of PRTS Tokens, your ability to 

access marketplaces on which to trade PRTS Tokens, the Issuer’s or the Fund’s ability to operate as an ongoing 

concern and the structure, rights and transferability of PRTS Tokens. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any 

new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have an adverse impact on the value of PRTS Tokens 
and otherwise impede the Issuer’s or the Fund’s activities.  

Tax risks. 

The tax characterization of PRTS Tokens is uncertain and a subscriber should consult its own tax advisor 
regarding the consequences of an investment in PRTS Tokens. An investment in PRTS Tokens may result in 

adverse tax consequences to subscribers, including withholding taxes, income taxes (possibly prior to the receipt by 

a subscriber of any cash or other property from the Issuer) and tax reporting requirements. It is possible that the 

income of the Issuer and/or the Fund would be subject to significant amounts of income and/or withholding taxes. 

Each potential subscriber should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own tax advisor with respect to 

the United States and non-U.S. tax consequences of an investment in PRTS Tokens. 

Non-U.S. investments. 

The Fund may invest outside of the United States. Non-U.S. securities involve certain factors not typically 
associated with investing in U.S. securities, including risks relating to (i) currency fluctuations and associated 

conversion costs; (ii) differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. securities markets, including volatility in and 

relative illiquidity of some non-U.S. securities markets, the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial 

reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision; (iii) certain economic 

and political risks, including potential restrictions on non-U.S. investment and repatriation of capital and the 

possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; and (iv) the imposition of non-U.S. withholding or other taxes 

with respect to such investment. 

Lack of registration of the PRTS Tokens or the Issuer, the Manager and the Fund.  

None of the Manager, the Issuer, the Fund, Argon Advisors or their affiliates or this Offering is currently 

registered under (1) the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), (2) the Investment 

Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), (3) the Securities Act, (4) the Securities and 

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), (5) the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the 
“CEA”) or (6) under any other applicable non-U.S. or U.S. international, federal or state securities, commodity, 

derivative or other applicable legal or regulatory regime. Persons, instruments or offerings registered under the 

Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the CEA, as a U.S. broker-dealer 

and under other legal or regulatory regimes, as applicable, may be required to comply with a variety of disclosure, 

reporting, compliance and operating-related obligations and regulatory supervision intended to protect investors. So 

long as the Issuer or the Fund are not subject to such requirements, or if we fail to adequately comply with such 

requirements if applicable, you will not have the benefit of such subscriber protections and will not receive 



 

44 

 

disclosure commensurate with that provided by registered entities. The Manager is expected to file with the 

Securities and Exchange Commission under the Advisers Act as an “Exempt Reporting Adviser.” 

If the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) or 

any other body were to require the registration of this Offering, the PRTS Tokens or the Issuer, the Fund, the 

Manager or their respective affiliates under the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act, the Securities Act, the 

Exchange Act, the CEA or any other legal or regulatory scheme, as applicable, there can be no assurance that such 

persons would be able to timely comply with the requirements of such registration or at all. There is no assurance 

that the Issuer and the Fund may not become subject to the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, the 

Exchange Act, the CEA, U.S. broker-dealer rules or other burdensome regulation either as a result of new or 

evolving laws and regulations and interpretations or existing laws, regulations and interpretations. Compliance with 

the disclosure, reporting, compliance and operating-related obligations of a registered entity or offering may be 

expensive and time-consuming, which may distract management from its investment and operating objectives, 

increase overhead expenses and decrease funds available for investments and the repurchase or redemption of PRTS 

Tokens. Such compliance may require the Issuer and/or the Fund to change the management and governance 
provisions outlined in this offering memorandum or the rights of PRTS Tokenholders.  

Any requirement for the Manager, the Issuer or the Fund or their affiliates to register under the Advisers Act, 

the Investment Company Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, as a broker-dealer under U.S. securities laws, or 

under any other applicable federal or state securities, commodity, derivative or other applicable legal or regulatory 

regime, or any penalty for failure to do so, or any determination that this Offering was not conducted in accordance 

with applicable laws and regulations, could subject such persons to civil or criminal penalties and fines, which could 

adversely impact the ability of the Manager, the Issuer or the Fund to take the actions outlined in this offering 
memorandum and conduct their business as described in this offering memorandum, or at all. Furthermore, such a 

requirement, penalty or determination could adversely impact the rights, value and transferability of the PRTS 

Tokens and impair your ability to recover your investment in the PRTS Tokens.  

The Issuer and the Fund rely on complex exemptions from regulation in conducting their activities. 

The Issuer and the Fund regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the 
Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and other applicable laws in various jurisdictions, in conducting the 

Offering and their business. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances 

depend on compliance by third parties whom they do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become 

unavailable to the Issuer and/or the Fund, they could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and 

their business could be materially and adversely affected. These regulations, if they become applicable to the Issuer 

or the Fund, could limit the Issuer’s and/or the Fund’s activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements. 

Registration under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. 

Because the PRTS Tokenholders do not have a direct financial interest in the Issuer and will not be sharing pro 

rata in the accrued profits and losses from the Fund’s investments in any cryptocurrency derivatives or other 

“commodity interests” (as defined in CFTC regulations), there could be a basis, under relevant case law and CFTC 

staff interpretative guidance, for concluding that the Issuer is not itself a “commodity pool” and is not operating a 

“commodity pool.” Accordingly, the Issuer does not intend to register with the CFTC as a “commodity pool 

operator.” Given that the Issuer will not, for compensation or profit, be providing advice to the PRTS Tokenholders 

or others regarding the advisability of trading in “commodity interests,” the Issuer also does not intend to register 

with the CFTC as a “commodity trading advisor.”  

Although the Fund may be considered a “commodity pool” as a result of investing in “commodity interests,” the 

Manager intends to rely on CFTC Rule 3.10(c)(3)(i) for a self-executing exemption from registration with the CFTC 

as a “commodity pool operator” and “commodity trading advisor.” Under this registration exemption, the Manager 

would still be subject to statutory anti-fraud prohibitions that are applicable to “commodity pool operators” and 

“commodity trading advisors.” If either the Manager, the Fund, or any person on whose behalf the Manager is acting 

in the capacity of a “commodity pool operator” or “commodity trading advisor” is or becomes located in the U.S., 

the Manager will not be able to rely on the registration exemption in CFTC Rule 3.10(c)(3)(i).  



 

45 

 

If the Issuer or the Manager were required to register with the CFTC or if any change in the Issuer’s, the 

Manager’s and/or the Fund’s operations were necessary to be eligible for a registration exemption or to be able to 

continue to rely upon a registration exemption, such registration or change in operations could adversely affect the 

Manager, the Issuer, and/or the Fund’s ability to implement its investment program, conduct its operations and/or 

achieve its objectives and could subject the Manager, the Issuer and/or the Fund to certain additional costs, expenses 

and administrative burdens. Furthermore, any determination by the Manager on behalf of the Fund to cease or to 
limit investing in interests which may be treated as “commodity interests” in order to comply with the regulations of 

the CFTC may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s and/or the Fund’s ability to implement its investment 

objectives and to hedge risks associated with its operations.  

In addition, the treatment of instruments such as the PRTS Tokens under current regulation is extremely 

uncertain. The CFTC may decide to regulate the PRTS Tokens as “commodity interests.” If that were to occur this 

Offering may be deemed not to comply with applicable law and regulation governing “commodity interests,” which 

may expose the Issuer, the Manager, and/or the Fund to civil penalties or fines which, in turn, may impair their 

ability to continue operating and may adversely impact the value of the PRTS Tokens. Furthermore, if the CFTC 
were to regulate the PRTS Tokens as “commodity interests,” the Issuer, the Manager, and/or the Fund may be 

subject to additional registration, reporting, compliance and operating restrictions. There can be no assurance that 

any of such persons would be capable of meeting such requirements in a timely manner or at all. If the actions of the 

Issuer, the Manager and/or the Fund are deemed not to comply with applicable law and requirements imposed by the 

CFTC, the Issuer, the Manager and/or the Fund may be subject to civil penalties or fines. Such consequences may 

endanger the Issuer’s and/or the Fund’s ability to continue to operate as described in this offering memorandum or at 

all and may indirectly adversely impact the value of your investment.  

Compliance with the AIFM Directive. 

The European Union Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the “Directive”) took effect at a national 

level within the member states of the European Union (the “EU”) on July 22, 2013. Subject to the availability of any 

applicable transitional relief, the Directive will from this time impose new requirements on non-EU alternative 

investment fund managers (“AIFM”) which market alternative investment funds (“AIF”) to professional investors 

within the EU.  

In particular, the Directive requires suitable cooperation agreements to be in place as between the relevant 

regulators of the United States and each EU member state in which PRTS Tokens are being marketed, the absence 

of which will potentially restrict the ability of the Issuer to offer PRTS Tokens to subscribers in such EU member 

states and may therefore limit the Issuer’s ability to attract subscribers based in the EU and lead to a reduction in the 

overall amount of capital invested in the Issuer. This may, in turn, have an adverse impact upon the operations of the 

Issuer, including the range of investment strategies that the Issuer is able to pursue. The Directive may also impose 

additional disclosure and reporting requirements in relation to the Issuer and the Fund and its investments, 

compliance with which may involve additional costs, as well as restrictions on early distributions or reductions in 

capital in respect of EU portfolio companies (the so-called “asset stripping” rules) which may result in additional 

costs and may limit the use of certain investment and realization strategies (such as dividend recapitalization and 
reorganizations) which do not apply to non-AIF/AIFM competitors not subject to the Directive, thereby potentially 

placing the Issuer at a disadvantage to such competitors. 

It may be possible for non-EU AIFMs to market an AIF within the EU pursuant to a pan-European marketing 

“passport” instead of under national private placement regimes, provided that the AIFM complies with all relevant 

provisions of the Directive including, among other things, rules relating to the remuneration of certain personnel, 

minimum regulatory capital requirements, restrictions on the use of leverage, further disclosure and reporting 

requirements to both investors and EU home state regulators, the independent valuation of an AIF’s assets and the 
appointment of legal representatives and an independent depository to hold assets. As a result, the Directive could in 

the future have other adverse effects in relation to the Issuer, the Fund and the Manager’s business by, among other 

things, increasing the regulatory burden and costs of operating and managing the Issuer and the Fund and its 

investments, and potentially requiring changes to compensation structures for key personnel, thereby affecting the 

Manager’s ability to recruit and retain these personnel.  

More generally, the Directive (and/or the interpretation thereof) could expose the Issuer, the Manager and/or the 

Fund to conflicting regulatory requirements in the United States and the EU and its member states.  



 

46 

 

It should be noted that the final scope and requirements of the Directive remain uncertain, and are subject to 

change as a result of enactment both of EU secondary legislation and national implementing legislation in EU 

member states.  

Risk arising from potential control group liability. 

Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), upon the termination of a tax-

qualified single employer defined benefit pension plan, the sponsoring employer and all members of its “controlled 

group” will be jointly and severally liable for 100% of the plan’s unfunded benefit liabilities whether or not the 

controlled group members have ever maintained or participated in the plan. In addition, the Pension Benefit 

Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) may assert a lien with respect to such liability against any member of the 

controlled group on up to 30% of the collective net worth of all members of the controlled group. Similarly, in the 
event a participating employer partially or completely withdraws from a multiemployer (union) defined benefit 

pension plan, any withdrawal liability incurred under ERISA will represent a joint and several liability of the 

withdrawing employer and each member of its controlled group.  

A “controlled group” includes all “trades or businesses” under 80% or greater common ownership. This 

common ownership test is broadly applied to include both “parent-subsidiary groups” and “brother-sister groups” 

applying complex exclusion and constructive ownership rules. However, regardless of the percentage ownership that 

the Fund holds in one or more of its portfolio companies, the Fund itself cannot be considered part of an ERISA 

controlled group unless the Fund is considered to be a “trade or business.” 

While there are a number of cases that have held that managing investments is not a “trade or business” for tax 

purposes, in 2007 the PBGC Appeals Board ruled that an investment fund was a “trade or business” for ERISA 

controlled group liability purposes and at least one Federal Circuit Court has similarly concluded that an investment 

fund could be a trade or business for these purposes based upon a number of factors, including the fund’s level of 

involvement in the management of its portfolio companies and the nature of any management fee arrangements. 

If the Fund were determined to be a trade or business for purposes of ERISA, it is possible, depending upon the 

structure of the investment by the Fund and/or its affiliates and other co-investors in a portfolio company and their 

respective ownership interests in the portfolio company, that any tax-qualified single employer defined benefit 

pension plan liabilities and/or multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities incurred by the portfolio company could 

result in liability being incurred by the Fund, with a resulting need for additional capital contributions, the 

appropriation of the Fund’s assets to satisfy such pension liabilities and/or the imposition of a lien by the PBGC on 

certain of the Fund’s assets. Moreover, regardless of whether or not the Fund were determined to be a trade or 

business for purposes of ERISA, a court might hold that one of the Fund’s portfolio companies could become jointly 

and severally liable for another portfolio company’s unfunded pension liabilities pursuant to the ERISA “controlled 

group” rules, depending upon the relevant investment structures and ownership interests as noted above. 

Developments in regulations may alter the nature of the Fund’s business or restrict the use of Blockchain assets or 

the operation of a Blockchain network upon which it relies in a manner that adversely affects its business or the 

PRTS Token. The application of existing regulation to the PRTS Token is unclear. 

As Blockchain networks and Blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size, non-U.S. and U.S. 
federal and state agencies have begun to take interest in, and in some cases regulate, their use and operation. In the 

case of virtual currencies, in the United States state regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services 

have created new regulatory frameworks. Other U.S. states, such as Texas, have published guidance on how their 

existing regulatory regimes apply to virtual currencies. Some U.S. states, such as New Hampshire and North 

Carolina, have amended their state’s statutes to include virtual currencies into existing licensing regimes. Treatment 

of virtual currencies continues to evolve under U.S. federal law as well. Both the Department of the Treasury and 

the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for example, have published guidance on the treatment of virtual 

currencies like Bitcoin. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service released guidance on treating Ether as property that is not 

currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although there is no indication yet whether other courts or federal or 

state regulators will follow this classification. Both federal and state agencies have instituted enforcement actions 

against those violating their interpretation of existing laws.

For example, the CFTC has publicly taken the position that certain Blockchain assets are commodities, and the 

SEC has taken the position that certain Blockchain assets are securities. To the extent that a government or quasi-

governmental agency exerts regulatory authority over a Blockchain network or asset upon which the Issuer’s and the 

Fund’s business relies, their businesses and your investment in the PRTS Token may be adversely affected. 

Developments in securities and corporate laws may alter the nature of the Issuer’s and/or the Fund’s businesses, or 

restrict the use of Blockchain assets or the operation of a Blockchain network upon which they rely, in a manner 

that adversely affects their businesses or the PRTS Token. The application of existing securities and corporate laws 

to the PRTS Token is unclear. 

Because of the differences between the PRTS Token and traditional investment securities, there is a risk that 

issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional securities were involved may not be easily resolved 
for the PRTS Token. For example, there is little precedent on how existing law might treat the issue, fungibility, 

settlement finality, transfer, collateralization, sequestration, loan, hypothecation, redemption or other disposition of 

PRTS Tokens. There is also little precedent on how existing law might treat the rights and obligations between and 

among the Issuer and subscribers. The occurrence of any related issue or dispute could have a material adverse 

effect on the Fund’s business or the PRTS Token. New developments in the law may also adversely affect the 

treatment of the PRTS Token or the Issuer’s or the Fund’s business.  

Developments in regulation, corporate and commercial laws may alter the nature of our business or restrict the use 

of Blockchain assets or the operation of a Blockchain network upon which we rely in a manner that adversely affects 
our business. 

Blockchain networks currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in 

other jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. Various jurisdictions may, in the near future, 

adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Ethereum Network and its users, particularly Ethereum 

Exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or 

directives may directly and negatively impact our business. The effect of any future regulatory change on Ether is 

impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to our business or Tokenholders. 

Issuer and Fund Risks 

The Issuer and the Fund are new entities with no operating history. 

The Issuer was incorporated on September 28, 2017 and the Fund was formed on September 22, 2017 and 
neither has yet commenced operations. Both the Issuer and the Fund are subject to all of the business risks and 

uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that the Fund will not achieve its investment 

objectives and that the value of your investment could decline substantially. The initial and only asset of the Issuer 

will be the sole Class A shares in the Fund. The sole initial asset of the Fund will be the gross proceeds from this 

Offering, less upfront expenses relating to this Offering. Initially, the Fund will invest the remainder of the cash 

received from the issuance in short-term investments, such as cash and cash equivalents, which it expects will earn 

low or no yields. Given the current low level of return for short-term fixed income investments, and given the 

Fund’s management fee and other expenses, the Fund will likely lose money until it becomes fully invested. 

Investment in the PRTS Tokens requires a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. The Fund’s 

investments will generally be private and may consist in part of illiquid holdings. As such, there may be no public 

markets for such securities or cryptocurrencies held by the Fund and no readily available liquidity mechanism at any 

particular time for some or all of the investments or cryptocurrencies held by the Fund. In addition, the realization of 

value from any investments will not be possible or known with any certainty until the Manager elects, in its sole 

discretion, to sell the Fund’s investments and subsequently distribute the proceeds to its subscribers or to distribute 

securities to subscribers in lieu of cash. Furthermore, given the Fund’s investment strategy, there may be significant 

competition among the Fund and other investors for a limited number of quality investment opportunities, which 
may result in the Fund deploying capital in a manner less efficiently than anticipated and consequently potentially 

resulting in a negative effect on the Fund and the PRTS Tokens. 

The Fund may invest in companies that may experience financial difficulties, which will require additional 

equity capital to be successful. Identifying potentially profitable enterprises is a difficult task. The companies in 



 

48 

 

which the Fund will invest may involve a high degree of risk. Such companies may face intense competition, 

including competition from companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, 

marketing and service capabilities, and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Many of 

the Fund’s investments will be highly illiquid, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to realize a 

return on such investments in a timely manner, if at all.  

Highly competitive market for investment opportunities. 

The activity of identifying, completing and successfully disposing of attractive investments is highly 

competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to locate 

and complete investments that satisfy the Fund’s objectives or realize their values, or that the Fund will be able to 

fully invest its capital. 

A number of entities will compete with the Fund to make the types of investments that the Fund plans to make. 

The Fund will compete with other funds, venture capital firms and venture capital funds, various investment funds, 

including hedge funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, funds raising 

funds through an ICO, commercial financing companies, and various technology companies’ internal venture capital 

arms. Many of the Fund’s potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, 

technical and marketing resources than it does. For example, some competitors may have a stronger network of 

contacts and better connections for deal flows or have access to funding sources that are not available to the Fund. In 

addition, some of the Fund’s competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could 
allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than the Fund. The 

competitive pressures the Fund faces could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and 

results of operations. As a result of this competition, the Fund may not be able to take advantage of attractive 

investment opportunities from time to time, and it can offer no assurance that it will be able to identify and make 

investments that are consistent with its investment objective. 

Some of the Fund’s portfolio investments are expected to be in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. 

The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. The 
Fund will value these securities quarterly at fair value according to its written valuation procedures and as 

determined in good faith by the Manager. The methods for valuing these securities may include: fundamental 

analysis (sales, income, or earnings multiples, etc.), discounts from market prices of similar securities, purchase 

price of securities, subsequent private transactions in the security or related securities, or discounts applied to the 

nature and duration of restrictions on the disposition of the securities, as well as a combination of these and other 

factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are 

inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time, and may be based on estimates, the Fund’s 

determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for 

these securities existed. The Fund’s net asset value could be adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair 

value of its investments were materially higher than the values that it ultimately realizes upon the disposal of such 

securities. 

In the event the Manager’s data set is made open source, or the Manager participates in a multi-manager 

platform, there is a risk that these actions will increase competition for investments, which can increase the costs of 

such investments and decrease returns. 

Non-control investments. 

The Fund is expected to hold non-controlling interests in most or all of its portfolio companies and, therefore, 
may have a limited ability to protect its positions in such companies. In these cases, the Fund will be significantly 

reliant on the existing management and board of directors of such companies, which may include representatives of 

other financial investors with whom the Fund is not affiliated and whose interests may conflict with the interests of 

the Fund. 

The Fund may co-invest with third parties, thereby acquiring non-controlling interests in certain portfolio 

companies. The Fund may not have control over these companies and, therefore, may have a limited ability to 

protect its position therein. Such investments may involve risks not present in investments where a third party is not 

involved, including the possibility that a third party partner or co-subscriber may have financial difficulties resulting 



 

49 

 

in a negative impact on such investment, may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent 

with those of the Fund, or may be in a position to take action contrary to the Fund’s investment objectives. In those 

circumstances where such third parties involve a management group, such third parties may receive compensation 

arrangements relating to such investments, including incentive compensation arrangements. Such compensation 

arrangements will reduce the returns of such investments. In addition, the Fund may in certain circumstances be 

liable for the actions of its third party partners or co-subscribers.  

The Manager and the Fund may offer the right to participate in investment opportunities of the Fund to other 

private subscribers, groups, partnerships, corporations or other entities, including, without limitation, any other 

funds managed by affiliates of the Manager whenever the Manager and the board of directors so determine. 

In addition to managing the Fund, the management personnel of the Manager may also manage other 
investment funds and devote time to other ventures. Furthermore, the Manager may advise additional funds in the 

future or undertake other commercial obligations. This may reduce the time the Manager and its investment 

management team have to devote to the affairs of the Fund and may adversely impact return on the Fund’s capital 

deployments. 

Risks associated with ICOs. 

The Fund expects to invest a large portion of its assets in ICOs. The Fund’s investments in these assets may be 
very sensitive to movements in related markets and trends and ICO markets, including regulatory developments, 

enforcement actions, security concerns and technological developments. In addition, by investing in such assets the 

Fund may be subject to international, federal and state securities, commodity or other laws which may, among other 

things, restrict the Fund’s ability to sell a portfolio investment and consequently adversely impact the value of its 

assets. 

The Fund will invest in cryptocurrencies.  

As a general matter, the rate at which fiat currency can be exchanged into cryptocurrency is extremely volatile. 

Given that they are relatively new forms of currency based on new technology, and given their extreme price 

volatility, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and their respective networks are not widely accepted or utilized, 

and cryptocurrencies of all types are generally not accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by retail 

and commercial outlets. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for 

cryptocurrency transactions, process wire transfers from cryptocurrency exchanges, or maintain accounts for persons 

or entities transacting in cryptocurrencies. A lack of expansion by Bitcoin or Ether into retail and commercial 
markets may result in further increased volatility or a reduction in value which could adversely impact an investment 

in the PRTS Tokens. Volatility in the values of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies can be significant, and a 

decrease in the value on these cryptocurrencies could indirectly have a material and adverse effect on the value of 

PRTS Tokens. 

The fundamental value of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies is sensitive to subjective perception. 

The value of a cryptocurrency could be based on its ease of use, the energy used to mine it, what it can be used 

to purchase, or its revolutionary technology, but there is no underlying value or an institution supporting its value. 

This results in price volatility, which encourages speculative behavior. Speculative subscribers may hold the 

cryptocurrency instead of spending it, which makes the currency illiquid. Furthermore, any particular 

cryptocurrency may become worthless, which could result in an adverse effect to the Fund’s business.  

A temporary or permanent Blockchain “fork” could adversely affect an investment in cryptocurrency.  

For example, The DAO, an organization using the Ethereum network, was hacked in June 2016, resulting in a 

loss of approximately 3.6 million Ether. In response to this loss, the Ethereum community agreed to create a new 

“hard fork” on the Ethereum network Blockchain which returned the lost Ether to The DAO. A hard fork is a change 

to the underlying Ethereum protocol, which creates new rules for the Ethereum system. At the time of the initial 

attack, the market price of Ether declined from over $20 to under $13. Since the attack on the DAO, there have been 

several more hacks resulting in millions of dollars of losses to investors. There is no assurance that future attacks 

could not occur or would not result in a sustained decline in the market price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and 



 

50 

 

Ether. Funds submitted for subscription in an ICO may be stolen through hacking the system which could indirectly 

have a material and adverse effect on the value of PRTS Tokens. 

Investments in start-ups and early stage companies with smaller capitalizations. 

Most investment opportunities in Blockchain industries and technologies in which the Fund intends to invest are 

with start-ups and early stage companies each of which typically have limited operating histories with and/or small 

market capitalizations. While the Manager believes that such investments can provide significant potential for 

appreciation, it recognizes that such investments may involve higher risks than investments in larger or more 

established companies and the value of such investments is likely to be more volatile. Further, the risk of bankruptcy 

or insolvency of many start-ups and smaller companies (with the attendant loss to investors) is often higher than for 

larger and more established companies. In addition, investments in these types of companies may be characterized 
by reduced liquidity of the related tokens and more abrupt and erratic market price movements than those of larger, 

more established companies. 

Most of the companies in which the Fund will invest will have limited to no operating history, making the 

Manager’s ability to evaluate the future prospects of those companies difficult. Before deciding to purchase the 

PRTS Tokens, a prospective subscriber should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early- to 

mid-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, particularly those companies whose businesses depend 

on the Internet and Blockchain technology. These risks include ability to (i) generate or increase revenues and 

manage costs; (ii) increase awareness of the company; (iii) offer compelling content; (iv) maintain current, and 
develop new, strategic relationships; (v) respond effectively to competitive pressures; (vi) develop and upgrade 

technology; (vii) attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and (viii) raise additional capital. The Manager 

cannot assure prospective PRTS Tokenholders that the Fund’s or its portfolio companies’ business strategy will be 

successful or that its portfolio companies will address these risks successfully. 

Implementation of the Manager’s investment strategy. 

Although the Fund and the Manager currently intend to pursue the investment strategy as set forth in this 
offering memorandum, they may change any aspect of their strategy at their discretion at any time. Accordingly, the 

industries, risk profiles, types of assets, technologies and types of portfolio companies in which the Fund invests 

may differ from those described in this offering memorandum and currently contemplated. The success of the 

Fund’s trading activities depends in large part on the Manager’s ability to identify attractive investment 

opportunities. Identification and exploitation of the investment strategies to be pursued by the Fund involves a high 

degree of uncertainty. No assurance can be given that the Manager will be able to locate suitable investment 

opportunities in which to deploy all of the Fund’s capital. A reduction in the volatility and pricing inefficiency of the 

markets in which the Fund will seek to invest, as well as other market factors, will reduce the scope for the Fund’s 

investment strategies. In some of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may seek constructively to work with 
management. There can be no assurance that the management of any company will agree or acquiesce to the Fund’s 

involvement in the affairs of the company, or that the strategies that the Fund helps to implement will be effective.  

Confidentiality: Adverse Publicity. 

While the Issuer believes the confidentiality of PRTS Tokenholders will be protected, there is no certainty of 
this or that any adverse publicity attaching to the Fund’s efforts to influence management will not have adverse 

consequences for PRTS Tokenholders, as well as for the Fund generally.  

Ultimate Fund Size. 

The number of investments and potential profitability of the Fund could be affected by the amount of funds at 
its disposal, and, in the event the Fund obtains less than the target amount of capital for deployment, the Fund’s 

investment return might be affected to a greater degree by errors in investment decisions than the investment returns 

of other entities with greater capitalization. 



 

51 

 

Other activities of the Manager and its affiliates. 

The Manager, certain of its personnel or affiliates may serve as investment manager, advisor and/or provide 
services for other funds, investment funds and investment accounts, including those with substantially the same 

investment objectives as the Fund’s (which may pursue their investment activities by contributing assets to the 

Fund), and also including additional investment funds and/or client accounts with investment objectives that differ 

in some respects to the Fund’s investment objective. Neither the Manager nor any of its personnel or affiliates is 

obligated to make any particular investment opportunity available to the Fund, and they may take advantage of any 

opportunity, either for other accounts the Manager, its personnel or affiliates manages or for themselves or other 

funds they manage. Differences in compensation arrangements among investment funds managed by the Manager, 

its personnel or affiliates and the fact that such persons may participate in the profits of other investment funds may 

create incentives for the Manager and its personnel to manage the Fund so as to favor those other funds. 

Additionally, these are no restrictions on the other activities of the Manager, its personnel or affiliates. 

Reliance on portfolio company management teams. 

Each portfolio company’s day-to-day operations will be the responsibility of such company’s management team. 

Such a management team may consist of personnel who are direct employees of the portfolio company or who are 

employees of an affiliate of the Manager. Although the Manager will be responsible for monitoring the performance 

of each portfolio investment, there can be no assurance that the existing management team, or any successor, will be 

able to operate any such portfolio company successfully. 

Investments with third parties.  

The Fund may co-invest with third parties, thereby acquiring non-controlling interests in certain portfolio 

companies. The Fund may not have control over these companies and, therefore, may have a limited ability to 
protect its position therein. Such investments may involve risks not present in investments in which a third party is 

not involved, including the possibility that a third party partner or co-investor may have financial difficulties 

resulting in a negative impact on such investment, may have economic or business interests or goals which are 

inconsistent with those of the Fund, or may be in a position to take action contrary to the Fund’s investment 

objectives. In those circumstances where such third parties involve a management group, such third parties may 

receive compensation arrangements relating to such investments, including incentive compensation arrangements. 

Such compensation arrangements will reduce the return to participants in the investments. In addition, the Fund may 

in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of its third party partners or co-investors. 

Material, non-public information. 

By reason of its investment in a portfolio company or otherwise, the Manager may acquire confidential or 

material non-public information or otherwise be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. The Fund 

will not be able to act upon any such information. Due to these restrictions, the Fund may not be able to initiate a 

transaction that it otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to sell a portfolio investment that it otherwise 

might have sold. 

Illiquid and long-term investments. 

The Fund may make investments that have limited liquidity. The market prices, if any, of such investments tend 

to be volatile and the Fund may not be able to sell such investments when it desires, or, upon sale, to realize what it 

perceives to be their fair value. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded are not subject to the 

disclosure and other investor protection requirements applicable to publicly traded securities. Dispositions of such 

investments may require a lengthy time period locking up capital and decreasing funds available for repurchases or 
redemptions of PRTS Tokens or investments in more attractive opportunities. If the Fund were forced to sell such an 

investment, it may not receive fair value therefore. 

Additionally, the Fund may acquire securities that cannot be sold except pursuant to a registration statement 

filed under the Securities Act or in accordance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act or another exemption under the 

Securities Act. There will likely be no near-term cash flow available to subscribers, and there is no assurance of any 

return of cash flows. Since the Fund may only make a limited number of investments and since many of the Fund’s 



 

52 

 

investments may involve a high degree of risk, poor performance by a few of the investments could severely affect 

the total returns to subscribers. Additionally, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. 

A disruption of the Internet or the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks could impair the value and the ability to transfer 

Bitcoin or Ether respectively.  

A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt the Bitcoin or Ethereum network’s operations until the 

disruption is resolved, and could have an adverse effect on the value of the PRTS Tokens. In addition, 

cryptocurrency networks have been subjected to a number of denial of service attacks, which led to temporary 

delays in transactions. It is possible that such an attack could adversely affect the Fund’s investments and indirectly 

also the value of the PRTS Tokens. 

Substantially all of the Fund’s and the Manager’s computer and communications hardware is located at a single 

facility, which leaves us vulnerable. 

Substantially all of the Fund’s computer and communications hardware is located at a single facility. These 

systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications 

failure, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. The back-up facility is 
not adequate to fully support the Fund’s operations for a prolonged period of time. Any system interruption that 

results in the unavailability of the Fund’s computer systems or reduced performance of its transaction systems could 

interrupt or substantially reduce its ability to conduct business. 

The Issuer and the Fund are subject to cyber security and data loss risks or other security breaches. 

The Issuer’s and the Fund’s business involves the storage and transmission of users’ proprietary information, 

and security breaches could cause a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and 

litigation. The Issuer and the Fund may be subjected to a variety of cyber-attacks, which may continue to occur from 

time to time. Cyber-attacks may target the Issuer and the Fund, their customers, suppliers, banks, credit card 

processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which they depend. An 

attack or a breach of security could result in a loss of private data, unauthorized trades, an interruption of trading for 

an extended period of time, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, 

damage to reputation, and a loss of confidence in security measures, any of which could have a material adverse 

effect on the Issuer’s and the Fund’s financial results and business. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect 

the ability of the Fund to operate, which could indirectly adversely affect the value of the PRTS Tokens. Any breach 

of data security that exposes or compromises the security of any of the private digital keys used to authorize or 
validate transaction orders, or that enables any unauthorized person to generate any of the private digital keys, could 

result in unauthorized trades and would have a material adverse effect on the Fund. Because trades utilizing 

Blockchain technology settle on the trade date, it could be impossible to correct unauthorized trades. 

Furthermore, attackers can manipulate the cryptocurrency market. The price of cryptocurrencies, such as 

Bitcoin and Ether, are set by several exchanges. If an exchange is attacked such that it is taken offline, traders can 

take advantage of price differences. Additionally, attackers can target platforms that buy and sell cryptocurrencies 

and digital wallets that hold cryptocurrencies. It is possible that such an attack could adversely affect the Fund’s 

investments and indirectly also the value of the PRTS Tokens. 

Leverage. 

Certain of the Fund’s portfolio companies may have capital structures with significant leverage. Consequently, 

the leveraged capital structure of such portfolio companies will increase their exposure to adverse factors such as 

rising interest rates, downturns in the economy or a deterioration in the business of a portfolio company or its 
industry, and may impair such companies’ ability to meet their debt obligations. Additionally, the Fund may 

leverage its investment positions by borrowing. Failure to satisfy the terms of debt incurred by the Fund can have 

negative consequences, including forced liquidation of Fund investments in order to satisfy the borrower’s 

obligations. Leverage may also take the form of trading on margin, which could result in interest charges that could 

be substantial. The use of leverage will have the effect of increasing the volatility of the Fund’s investments. 



 

53 

 

High yield and preferred securities. 

The Fund’s investments may include “high yield” bonds, convertible and preferred securities that are rated in 
the lower rating categories by the various credit rating agencies or comparable non-rated securities. Securities in the 

lower-rated categories and comparable non-rated securities are subject to greater risk of loss of principal and interest 

than higher-rated and comparable non-rated securities, and are generally considered to be predominantly speculative 

with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They are also generally considered to be 

subject to greater risk than securities with higher ratings in the case of deterioration of general economic conditions. 

Because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with lower-rated and comparable non-

rated securities, the markets for such securities may be more volatile, less liquid, and less active than that for higher-

rated securities, which can adversely affect the prices at which these securities can be sold and may even make it 

impractical or impossible to sell such securities at times of extreme market dislocation. 

Distressed securities. 

Certain of the Fund’s assets may be invested in distressed securities. Investments in distressed securities involve 

acquiring securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or operating difficulties and of 

companies that are, or appear likely to become, bankrupt or involved in a debt restructuring or other major capital 

transaction. Investment in distressed securities involves a high degree of credit and market risk. Although the Fund 

will invest in select companies that, in the view of the Manager, have the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns, 

there can be no assurance that such financially troubled issuers or operationally troubled issuers can be successfully 
restructured or transformed into profitable operating companies. During an economic downturn or recession, 

securities of distressed issuers are more likely to go into default than securities of other issuers. In addition, it may 

be difficult to obtain information about financially troubled issuers and operationally troubled issuers. Distressed 

securities are less liquid and more volatile than securities of companies not experiencing financial or operating 

difficulties. The market prices of such securities are subject to erratic and abrupt market movements and the spread 

between bid and ask prices may be greater than normally expected. In addition, it is anticipated that many of the 

Fund’s distressed investments may not be widely traded and that the Fund’s investment in such securities may be 

substantial relative to the market for such securities. As a result, the Fund may experience delays and incur losses 

and other costs in connection with the sale of such securities. 

The Fund may invest in the securities of companies involved in bankruptcy proceedings, reorganizations and 

financial restructurings and may have a more active participation in the affairs of the Issuer than is generally 

assumed by a subscriber. This may subject the Fund to litigation risks or prevent the Fund from disposing of 

securities. In a bankruptcy or other proceeding, the Fund as a creditor may be unable to enforce its rights in any 

collateral or may have its security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims of 

other creditors. In addition, under certain circumstances, payments to the Fund and payments by the Fund to PRTS 

Tokenholders, if any, may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a 

fraudulent conveyance or a preferential payment. 

Hedging policies/risks. 

The Fund may employ hedging techniques, including, but not limited to, forwards, swaps, short sales and put 

and call options designed to reduce the risks associated with its investments including adverse movements in interest 

rates, securities prices and currency exchange. While such transactions may reduce certain risks, such transactions 

themselves may entail certain other risks. Thus, while the Fund may benefit from the use of these hedging 

mechanisms, unanticipated changes in interest rates, securities prices, or currency exchange rates may result in a 
poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into such hedging transactions. For example, to 

complete a short sale, the Fund generally must borrow the securities from a third party in order make delivery to the 

buyer. The Fund will be obligated to return securities equivalent to those borrowed at any time on demand of the 

lender of the securities borrowed by purchasing them at the market price at the time of replacement. Theoretically, 

short selling may be subject to unlimited risk of loss because there may be no limit on how much the price of a 

security may appreciate before the short position is closed. As a hedging technique, the Fund may also purchase 

exchange-listed and over-the-counter put and call options on specific securities or write and sell covered or 

uncovered call and put option contracts. Use of put and call options may result in losses to the Fund, force the sale 

or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than (in the case of put options) or lower 

than (in the case of call options) current market values, limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on its 



 

54 

 

investments or cause the Fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell. For example, a decline in the market price 

of a particular security could result in a complete loss of the amount expended by the Fund to purchase a call option 

(equal to the premium paid for the option and any associated transaction charges). An adverse price movement may 

result in unanticipated losses with respect to covered options sold by the Fund. The use of uncovered option writing 

techniques may entail greater risks of potential loss to the Fund than other forms of options transactions. It is 

generally impossible to fully hedge an investment given the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of projected 
cash flows and investment returns, if any, on the Fund’s investments. Additionally, the Fund’s investments will also 

be exposed to certain risks that cannot be hedged. There can be no assurance that any of the Fund’s hedging 

activities will be successfully implemented. 

Swaps 

Investments in swaps involve the exchange by the Fund with another party of all or a portion of their respective 

interests or commitments. For example, in the case of currency swaps, the Fund may exchange with another party 

their respective commitments to pay or receive currency. Use of swaps subjects the Fund to risk of default by the 

counterparty. If there is a default by the counterparty to such a transaction, the Fund will have contractual remedies 

pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. The Fund may enter into a wide array of swaps which may be 

surrogates for other instruments such as currency forwards, interest rate options, and equity instruments. The value 

of such instruments generally depends upon price movements in the underlying assets as well as counterparty risk. 

Derivatives 

The Fund may invest in complex derivative instruments that seek to modify or emulate the investment 

performance of particular securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, indices or markets or specific risks 

thereof on a leveraged or unleveraged basis which can be equivalent to a long or short position in the underlying 

asset or risk. These instruments generally have counterparty risk and may not perform in the manner expected by the 

counterparties, thereby resulting in greater loss or gain to the Fund than might otherwise be anticipated. These 

investments are all subject to additional risks that may result in a loss of all or part of an investment, such as interest 

rate and credit risk volatility, world and local market price and demand, and general economic factors and activity. 
Derivatives may have very high leverage embedded in them which may substantially magnify market movements 

and result in losses substantially greater than the amount of the investment and which in some cases could represent 

a significant portion of the Fund’s assets.  

Futures 

Futures markets are highly volatile. To the extent the Fund engages in transactions in futures contracts and 

options on futures contracts, the profitability of the Fund will depend to some degree on the ability of the Manager 

to analyze correctly the futures markets, which are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand 

relationships, governmental policies, commercial and trade programs, world political and economic events and 

changes in interest rates. Moreover, investments in commodity futures and options contracts involve additional risks 

including, without limitation, leverage (margin is usually only 5-15% of the face value of the contract and exposure 

can be nearly unlimited) and credit risk vis-a-vis the contract counterparty.  

Forward Trading  

Forward contracts and options thereon, unlike futures contracts, are not traded on exchanges and are not 

standardized; rather, banks and dealers act as principals in these markets, negotiating each transaction on an 

individual basis. Forward and “cash” trading is substantially unregulated; there is no limitation on daily price 

movements and speculative position limits are not applicable. The principals who deal in the forward markets and 

“cash” trading are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and these 

markets can experience periods of illiquidity, sometimes of significant duration. There have been periods during 

which certain participants in these markets have refused to quote prices for certain currencies or commodities or 
have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they were prepared to buy and that at 

which they were prepared to sell. Disruptions can occur in any market traded by the Fund due to unusually high 

trading volume, regulatory or political intervention or other factors. The imposition of controls by governmental 

authorities might also limit such forward trading to less than that which the Manager would otherwise recommend, 

to the possible detriment of the Fund. Market illiquidity or disruption could result in losses to the Fund.

Counterparty Risk  

The Fund is subject to various counterparty risks. For example, the Fund may effect a portion of their 
transactions in “over-the-counter” or “interdealer” markets or through private transactions. The participants in such 

markets and the counterparties in such private transactions are typically not subject to credit evaluation and 

regulatory oversight as are members of “exchange based” markets. This may expose the Fund to the risk that a 

counterparty will not settle a transaction because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the Fund to suffer 

losses. Such “counterparty risk” is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to 

prevent settlement, or where the Fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. 

The Fund is not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of its 

transactions with one counterparty. 

Currency Trading Risk  

The Fund may engage in currency (including cryptocurrency) transactions to effect investment transactions to 

generate returns consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and strategies (i.e., speculative currency trading 

strategies) and/or to hedge against uncertainty in the level of future exchange rates. Currency exchange transactions 

will be conducted on either a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the rate prevailing in the currency exchange market, or through 

entering into forward currency exchange contracts (“forward contract”) to purchase or sell currency at a future date. 

The Fund may also enter into options on currency. Currency spot, forward and option prices are highly volatile and 

forward, spot and option contracts may be illiquid. From time to time, governments intervene directly in these 
markets with the specific intention of influencing such prices. Currency trading may also involve economic leverage 

(i.e., the Fund may have the right to a return on its investment that exceeds the return that the Fund would expect to 

receive based on the amount contributed to the investment), which can increase the gain or the loss associated with 

changes in the value of the underlying instrument. Forward currency contracts are subject to the risk that should 

forward prices increase, a loss will be incurred to the extent that the price of the currency agreed to be purchased 

exceeds the price of the currency agreed to be sold. Due to the tax treatment of gains and losses on certain currency 

forward and options contracts, the use of such instruments may cause fluctuations in the Fund’s income.  

Investment and Trading Risks  

All investments risk the loss of capital and no assurance is made that the Fund’s investment program will be 

successful. The Fund’s investment program may utilize such investment techniques as short sales, leverage, swaps, 

options on securities, forward contracts and futures contracts, which techniques can, in certain circumstances, 

maximize the adverse impact to which the Fund may be subject. 

Analytical Model Risks 

The Fund employs certain strategies which depend upon the reliability, accuracy and analysis of the Manager’s 

analytical models. To the extent such models (or the assumptions underlying them) do not prove to be correct, the 

Fund may not perform as anticipated, which could result in substantial losses. All models ultimately depend upon 

the judgment of the Manager and the assumptions embedded in them. To the extent that with respect to any 

investment, the judgment or assumptions are incorrect, the Fund can suffer losses. 

Risk of limited number of investments. 

The Fund may participate in a limited number of investments and, as a consequence, the aggregate return of the 

Fund may be substantially and adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of even a single investment. 

Subscribers have no assurance as to the degree of diversification of the Fund’s portfolio investments, either by 

geographic region, asset type or sector. In circumstances where the Manager intends to exit an investment, there will 
be a risk that such exit may not be completed, which could lead to increased risk as a result of the Fund having an 

unintended long-term investment as to a portion of the amount invested and/or reduced diversification. 

Contingent liabilities on disposition of portfolio investments. 

In connection with the disposition of a portfolio investment, the Fund may be required to make representations 
about the business and financial affairs of such company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a 



 

56 

 

business. The Fund also may be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such 

representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities for which 

the Manager may establish reserves or escrows. 

Effect of Management Fee and Carried Interest. 

The existence of the Manager’s annual management fee of 2.5% of NAV and the Class B shareholder’s Carried 

Interest of 25% of the Fund’s realized capital gains may create an incentive for the Manager to make riskier or more 

speculative investments on behalf of the Fund than would be the case in the absence of this arrangement. 

Expedited transactions. 

Investment analyses and decisions by the Manager may be undertaken on an expedited basis in order for the 

Fund to take advantage of available investment opportunities. In such cases, the information available to the 

Manager at the time of the investment decision may be limited, and the Manager may not have access to the detailed 

information necessary for a thorough evaluation of the investment opportunity. Further, the Manager may conduct 

its due diligence activities over a very brief period. 

Reliance on the Manager. 

The Manager has exclusive responsibility for the Fund’s investment activities, and PRTS Tokenholders will not 

be able to make investment or any other decisions in the management of the Fund or its portfolio companies. 

Furthermore, PRTS Tokenholders will have no voting or other rights to make decisions with respect to the Issuer or 

its management. The success of the Fund will depend in part upon the skill and expertise of the personnel of the 
Manager. There can be no assurance that these persons will continue to be associated with the Manager. 

Valuations. 

When the Fund invests in illiquid tokens or instruments, it may be difficult for the Manager to accurately 
determine the fair market value. Valuations of such assets for the purposes of determining the Fund’s NAV may be 

speculative and will depend largely on the Manager’s judgment. Furthermore, the Manager may rely on information 

provided by third parties in valuing the Fund’s liquid or illiquid assets and its liabilities, which information may be 

incomplete, inaccurate or otherwise unreliable. To the extent the Manager relies on such information, its valuations 

and NAV calculations may be inaccurate. The Manager’s judgment on such matters shall be binding and not subject 

to audit by the Issuer, the PRTS Tokenholders or other outside persons. These risks in NAV valuation can affect the 

amount of the fee payable by the Fund.  

Because of the illiquidity of certain positions that may be held by the Fund, the liquidation values of the Fund’s 
securities and other investments may differ significantly from the interim valuations of such investments made by 

the Manager. Such differences may be further affected by the time frame within which such liquidation occurs. 

Third-party pricing information may not be available regarding certain of the Fund’s securities and other 

investments. 

It is possible that, there will be no readily available market for a substantial number of the Fund’s investments 

and hence, most of the Fund’s investments will be difficult to value. Due to the absence of readily available market 

valuations or market quotations for securities of the Fund’s privately held portfolio companies, the valuation of the 

Fund’s investments in such portfolio companies is determined in good faith by the Manager; the Fund is not 
required to have such valuations independently determined. 

Despite the Manager’s efforts to acquire sufficient information to monitor certain of the Fund’s investments and 

make well-informed valuation and pricing determinations, the Manager may only be able to obtain limited 

information at certain times. It is possible that the Manager may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse 

changes that have occurred with respect to certain of the Fund’s investments. The Manager may have to make 

valuation determinations without the benefit of an adequate amount of relevant information. Prospective subscribers 

should be aware that as a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, any valuation made by the 
Manager may not represent the fair market value of the securities acquired by the Fund. 



 

57 

 

Broker, dealer or exchange insolvency. 

While great care is taken in selecting the brokers, dealers, exchanges or wallets that will maintain custody of 
certain of the assets of the Fund, there is a residual risk that any of such persons could become insolvent or 

otherwise become insecure. There may be practical or timing problems associated with enforcing the rights of the 

Fund to its respective assets in the case of an insolvency or security disruption of any such party. Furthermore, 

currently it may not be possible for third parties to maintain custody of certain of the assets of the Fund. 

Risk of misconduct of employees and of third party service providers. 

Misconduct by employees of the Manager or third party service providers could cause significant losses to the 
Fund. Employee misconduct may include binding the Fund to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present 

unacceptable risks and unauthorized trading activities or concealing unsuccessful trading activities (which, in either 

case, may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses). Losses could also result from actions by third party 

service providers, including, without limitation, failing to recognize trades and misappropriating assets. In addition, 

employees and third party service providers may improperly use or disclose confidential information, which could 

result in litigation or serious financial harm, including limiting the Fund’s business prospects or future marketing 

activities. No assurances can be given that the due diligence performed by the Manager will identify or prevent any 

such misconduct. 

Future and past performance.  

Although the personnel of the Manager have managed investment funds, the performance of these other Funds 

and the prior results of such funds or their prior investments are not indicative of the results that the Fund may 

achieve in the future. 

The performance of the prior investments of the members of the Manager’s executive team may not be 

indicative of the Fund’s future results. While the Manager intends for the Fund to make investments that have 

estimated returns commensurate with the risks undertaken, there can be no assurance that targeted results will be 

achieved. Loss of principal is possible on any given investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will 

achieve its investment objective. 

The Manager’s management personnel may manage other funds. 

In addition to managing the Fund, the management personnel of the Manager may also manage other 

investment funds and devote time to other ventures in the future. Furthermore, the Manager may advise additional 

funds in the future or undertake other commercial obligations. This may reduce the time the Manager and its 

investment management team have to devote to the affairs of the Fund and may adversely impact return on the 

Fund’s capital deployments. 

The Fund’s investment returns will depend on its ability to manage future growth effectively. 

The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective will depend on its ability to grow, which will depend, in 

turn, on the Manager’s ability to identify, invest in, and monitor companies that meet the Fund’s investment criteria. 

Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of the Manager’s structuring of the 

investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive, and efficient services and access to financing on 

acceptable terms. The management team of the Manager will have substantial responsibilities with respect to 
managing the Fund. In addition, the employees of the Manager and its respective affiliates may also be called upon 

to provide managerial assistance to the Fund’s portfolio companies. Such demands on their time may distract them 

or slow the rate of investment. Any failure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect 

on the Fund’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

No assurance of the Manager’s success in locating or investing in portfolio companies. 

There can be no assurance that the Manager will be able to locate suitable investments for the Fund. Although 
the Manager will attempt to make investments on behalf of the Fund which meet the criteria set forth in this offering 

memorandum, there is no assurance that such investments can be located. Market and other conditions may require 



 

58 

 

the Fund to make investments that offer a lower rate of return or involve a higher degree of risk than described 

herein. The success of the Fund’s investment activities depends on the Manager’s ability to identify investment 

opportunities. Identification and exploitation of investment opportunities to be pursued by the Fund involves a high 

degree of uncertainty. A reduction in the volatility and pricing inefficiency of the markets in which the Fund will 

seek to invest or systematic or structural changes in the equity or credit markets generally may reduce or increase the 

scope of the Fund’s investment opportunities. No assurance can be given that the Manager will be able to locate 
suitable investment opportunities in which to deploy the Fund’s capital. 

No assurance of returns. 

There can be no assurance that PRTS Tokenholders will receive value on redemption from the Fund in an 

amount equal to their investment in the Fund. The timing of profit realization, if any, is highly uncertain. The Fund’s 
operating costs may exceed the Fund’s income, thereby requiring the difference to be paid out of the Fund’s capital. 

The expenses of the Fund in its early years will likely exceed its income. Such losses will reduce the Fund’s capital. 

It is possible that these losses may never be recovered. 

Reliance on the Manager’s investment discretion for the Fund. 

The Manager will have sole discretion over the investment of the funds committed to the Fund as well as the 
ultimate realization of any profits. PRTS Tokenholders will not receive the detailed financial information issued by 

portfolio companies that will be available to the Fund. Accordingly, PRTS Tokenholders will not have the 

opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that will be utilized by the Manager 

in its selection of investments. As such, the pool of funds in the Fund represents a blind pool of funds. PRTS 

Tokenholders will be relying on the Manager to identify, structure, and implement investments consistent with the 

Fund’s investment objectives and policies and to conduct the business of the Fund as contemplated by this offering 

memorandum. PRTS Tokenholders will not make decisions with respect to the management, disposition or other 

realization of any investment made by the Fund, or other decisions regarding the Fund’s business and affairs. 

Focused investment strategy. 

The Fund will generally be focused on making strategic investments in digital tokens and actively managing 

digital tokens, cryptocurrency and other cryptocurrency investments (including derivatives linked thereto), although 

it may change its investment focus at any time without notice and without the consent of PRTS Tokenholders. A 

specific investment focus is inherently more risky and could cause the Fund’s investments to be more susceptible to 

particular economic, political, regulatory, technological or industry conditions or occurrences compared with a fund, 
or a portfolio of funds, that is more diversified or has a broader industry focus.  

Portfolio company turnover. 

Changes with respect to portfolio companies will be made as the Manager considers necessary in seeking to 

achieve the Fund’s investment objective. The rate of portfolio turnover will not be treated as a limiting or relevant 
factor when circumstances exist that are considered by management to make portfolio changes advisable. 

Although some of the Fund’s investments are expected to be relatively long term in nature, the Manager may 

make changes in particular portfolio holdings whenever it is considered that an investment no longer has substantial 

growth potential or has reached its anticipated level of performance, or (especially when cash is not otherwise 

available) that another investment appears to have a relatively greater opportunity for capital appreciation. The 

Manager may also make general portfolio changes to increase the Fund’s cash to position it in a defensive posture. 

The Manager may make portfolio changes without regard to the length of time the Fund has held an investment, or 

whether a sale results in profit or loss, or whether a purchase results in the reacquisition of an investment that the 
Fund may have only recently sold. The Fund’s investments in privately held companies will be illiquid, which will 

limit portfolio turnover. The portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly during a year as well as from year to year and 

may also be affected by cash requirements. 



 

59 

 

Reserves. 

As is customary in the industry, the Fund may establish reserves for follow-on investments by the Fund in 
portfolio companies, operating expenses, the Fund liabilities, and other matters. Estimating the appropriate amount 

of such reserves is difficult, especially for follow-on investment opportunities, which are directly tied to the success 

and capital needs of portfolio companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves could impair the investment returns to the 

Fund and the NAV. If reserves are inadequate, the Fund may be unable to take advantage of attractive follow-on or 

other investment opportunities or to protect its existing investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated 

with “pay-to-play” or similar provisions. If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive investment 

opportunities or hold unnecessary amounts of capital in money market or similar low-yield accounts. 

The lack of liquidity in the Fund’s investments may adversely affect its NAV. 

The Fund will primarily make investments in cryptocurrency, other appropriate investments related to digital 

tokens, cryptocurrencies and other cryptocurrency investments (and derivatives linked thereto). Substantially all of 

these assets have the potential to be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or could otherwise be less liquid 

than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of the Fund’s portfolio or a portion of its portfolio means that it 

cannot realize the portfolio quickly and it may realize significantly less than the value at which it has previously 

recorded its investments. In addition, the Fund may face other restrictions on its ability to liquidate an investment in 

a portfolio company to the extent that it has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company. Any 

such lack of liquidity may adversely affect its NAV and may indirectly adversely affect the PRTS Tokens.  

You may not have the skills necessary to secure, trade, or collect distributions using PRTS Tokens. 

Participating in this Offering requires technical skill beyond that of many subscribers. Securing, trading or 

collecting distributions relating to PRTS Tokens requires working knowledge of Blockchain technology, Blockchain 
assets and their attendant systems and processes. Similar knowledge of Blockchain asset exchanges and other 

industry participants may be required. 

The loss or destruction of a private key required to access Blockchain assets may be irreversible. The Fund’s or 

your loss of access to private keys – or any other data loss concerning the Fund’s Blockchain assets – could have a 

material adverse effect on its business or the PRTS Tokens. 

Blockchain assets include, without limitation, Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies, PRTS Tokens and 
other cryptographic PRTS Tokens. Blockchain assets are controllable only by those who know the unique private 

cryptographic key relating to the network address at which the Blockchain assets are held. The Fund and the PRTS 

Tokenholders are required by the operation of many Blockchain networks to publish the addresses concerning 

Blockchain assets in use by them. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no 

backup of the private key is accessible, the Fund or you may not be able to access the Blockchain asset associated 

with the corresponding address and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the network. Any loss of 

private keys relating to digital wallets used to store Blockchain assets could have a material adverse effect on the 

Fund’s business or you. 

The further development and acceptance of Blockchain networks, which are part of a new and rapidly changing 

industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development 

or acceptance of the Blockchain networks upon which the Issuer and the Fund rely could have an adverse material 

adverse effect on each of them. 

The growth of the Blockchain industry in general, as well as the Blockchain networks on which the Issuer and 

the Fund rely, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The performance of the Issuer and the Fund is subject to the 
following uncertainties, among others:  

(i) Worldwide growth in the adoption and use of BTC, ETH and other Blockchain technologies;  

(ii) Government and quasi-government regulation of BTC, ETH and other Blockchain assets and their use, or 
restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of Blockchain networks or similar systems;  



 

60 

 

(iii) The maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the BTC or ETH networks;  

(iv) Changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;  

(v) The availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or 

trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies or existing networks;  

(vi) General economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies;  

(vii) Hacking and theft of cryptocurrencies and tokens; and  

(viii) Popularity or acceptance of the BTC or ETH networks and the emergence of new cryptocurrencies and 

Blockchain networks. 

In the event that a more efficient digital token protocol than BTC or the ERC20 smart contract emerges, the 

Issuer in its discretion may replace the form of the token or the portfolio tokens with a token on a new protocol, and 

if the Issuer does not replace the form of token, this could adversely affect the value of the PRTS Tokens. 

The prices of Blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of Bitcoins or Ether could 

materially and adversely affect the Fund’s business. 

The prices of Blockchain assets are significant uncertainties for the Fund’s business. The price of Bitcoin and 
Ether are subject to dramatic fluctuations. Several factors may affect price, including, but not limited to:  

(i) Global Blockchain asset supply;  

(ii) Global Blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants’ and 

commercial businesses’ acceptance of Blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, 

the security of online Blockchain asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold Blockchain assets, the perception that 

the use and holding of Blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use;  

(iii) Investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;  

(iv) Changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying a Blockchain network;  

(v) Changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in a Blockchain 

network;  

(vi) Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which Ether and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be 

exchanged for fiat currencies;  

(vii) Fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of Blockchain asset exchanges and liquidity on such 

exchanges;  

(viii) Interruptions in service from or failures of major Blockchain asset exchanges;  

(ix) Investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and registered funds, that may directly 

or indirectly invest in Blockchain assets;  

(x) Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;  

(xi) Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of Blockchain assets; 

(xii) The maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin or Ethereum 

networks;  

(xiii) Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations;  

(xiv) Expectations among Blockchain participants that the value of Blockchain assets will soon change; and  



 

61 

 

(xv) A decrease in the price of Blockchain assets that may have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s financial 

condition and operating results. 

The suitability of the Blockchain networks on which the Issuer relies could decline due to a variety of causes, 

adversely affecting its business or the functionality of the PRTS Tokens. 

Blockchain networks are based on software protocols that govern the peer-to-peer interactions between 

computers connected to these networks. The suitability of the networks for the Issuer’s and the Fund’s business or 

the functionality of the PRTS Tokens depends upon a variety of factors, including:  

(i) The effectiveness of the informal groups of (often uncompensated) developers contributing to the protocols 

that underlie the networks;  

(ii) Effectiveness of the network validators and the network’s consensus mechanisms to effectively secure the 

networks against confirmation of invalid transactions;  

(iii) Disputes among the developers or validators of the networks;  

(iv) Changes in the consensus or validation schemes that underlie the networks, including shifts between so-

called “proof of work” and “proof of stake” schemes;  

(v) The failure of cyber security controls or security breaches of the networks;  

(vi) The existence of other competing and operational versions of the networks, including without limitation so-

called “forked” networks;  

(vii) The existence of undiscovered technical flaws in the networks;  

(viii) The development of new or existing hardware or software tools or mechanisms that could negatively 

impact the functionality of the systems;  

(ix) The price of Blockchain assets associated with the networks;  

(x) Intellectual property rights-based or other claims against the networks’ participants; and  

(xi) The maturity of the computer software programming languages used in connection with the networks. 

Unfavorable developments or characteristics of any of the above circumstances could adversely affect the 

Fund’s business or the functionality of the PRTS Token. 

The foregoing risks do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the risks involved in acquiring a PRTS 

Token. Potential subscribers are urged to read this entire offering memorandum and consult their advisors before 

making a determination whether to invest in PRTS Tokens.

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS 

The issuance and sale of the PRTS Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other 
applicable securities laws and, unless so registered, the PRTS Tokens may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise 

transferred within the United States or to or for the account of any U.S. Person, except pursuant to an exemption 

from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable 

securities laws. The PRTS Tokens are being offered and issued, only (i) in the United States to up to 99 “accredited 

investors” (as defined in section 501 of the Securities Act) in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act who 

are U.S. Persons (as defined in Section 902 of Regulation S under the Securities Act) and (ii) outside the United

States within the meaning of Regulation S, the purchaser acknowledges that it may not sell 

or otherwise transfer the PRTS Tokens at any time to a U.S. Person or for the account or 

benefit of a U.S. Person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act. 

(5) If such purchaser is a U.S. Person or is an acquirer in a transaction occurring inside 
the United States, the purchaser acknowledges that until one year following the issuance of 

the PRTS Tokens it will not be permitted to offer, sell or transfer the PRTS Tokens and that 

after such date it will not be permitted to sell or otherwise transfer the PRTS Tokens to any 

other U.S. Person unless it sells all of its PRTS Tokens to a single U.S. Person. 

(6) It is not a person in Singapore, or in any jurisdiction in which the offer and sale of PRTS 
Tokens is not permitted – prospective subscribers must review the selling restrictions described 

herein, including matters under “To Subscribers Generally.”

INVITATION TO PURCHASE, THE PRTS TOKENS IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH OFFER 

OR SALE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL. NEITHER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 

COMMISSION (THE “SEC”) NOR ANY STATE, PROVINCIAL OR TERRITORIAL SECURITIES 

COMMISSION NOR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED 

OF THE PRTS TOKENS OR DETERMINED IF THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS TRUTHFUL OR 

COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IN THE 

UNITED STATES.  

We have not authorized anyone to provide any information other than that contained or incorporated by 

reference in this offering memorandum. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the 

reliability of, any other information that others may give you. We have not authorized anyone to provide you 

with information that is different. The Issuer takes no responsibility for, and cannot provide any assurance as 

to the reliability of, any information or any representations outside of this offering memorandum. 

The information in this offering memorandum is current only as of the date on its cover. For any time 

after the cover date of this offering memorandum, the information, including information concerning our 

business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed. Neither the delivery of 

this offering memorandum nor any sale made hereunder shall, under any circumstances, create any 

implication that there have been no changes in our affairs after the date of this offering memorandum. 

This offering memorandum is a document that we are providing only to prospective purchasers of the PRTS 

Tokens as described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is personal to each offeree and does 

not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the PRTS 

Tokens. You are authorized to use this offering memorandum solely for the purpose of considering the purchase of 

the PRTS Tokens from us. You should read this offering memorandum in its entirety before making a decision on 

whether to purchase any PRTS Tokens.  

You expressly agree, by accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, that the Issuer is not giving you any 

legal, business, financial or tax advice.  

The agreements set forth in the preceding sentence are intended for the benefit of the Issuer.  

We have prepared this offering memorandum and are solely responsible for its contents. You are responsible for 

making your own examination and your own assessment of the merits and risks of investing in the PRTS Tokens. 

By purchasing any PRTS Tokens, you will be deemed to have acknowledged that:  

 you have reviewed this offering memorandum in its entirety;  

 you have been afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review, and have received, all additional 
information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information 

contained in this offering memorandum;  

 this offering is being made in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for an 
offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering or in transactions not subject to 

registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation D and Regulation S thereunder and does not 

comply in important respects with the rules of the SEC that would apply to an offering document relating to 

a public offering of securities;  

 you are not a person in Singapore, or in any jurisdiction in which the offer and sale of PRTS Tokens is not 
permitted under applicable law (see “To Subscribers Generally”), and that the PRTS Tokens acquired by 

you will not, whether directly or indirectly, be offered, sold or transferred to, or be made the subject of an 

invitation for subscription, purchase or acquisition by, any person in Singapore, nor a person in any 
jurisdiction where such transfer is not permitted under applicable law; and  



 

66 

 

 no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representation concerning the Issuer, this 
offering or the PRTS Tokens, other than as contained in this offering memorandum, in connection with 

your examination of us and the terms of this offering.  

The Issuer is not providing you legal, business, financial or tax advice about any matter. You may not legally be 
able to participate in this private, unregistered offering. You should consult with your own attorney, accountant and 

other advisors about those matters (including determining whether you may legally participate in this offering). You 

should contact us with any questions about this offering.  

This offering memorandum contains summaries of certain agreements that we have entered into or will enter 

into in connection with this Offering. The descriptions contained in this offering memorandum of these agreements 

do not purport to be complete and are subject to, or qualified in their entirety by reference to, the definitive 
agreements. Copies of such agreements will be made available without charge to you in response to a written request 

to us. 

The Issuer intends to list the PRTS Tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. Although in the future we may apply 

to list the PRTS Tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges or automated quotation systems, we do not currently have any 

plans to apply for the inclusion of the PRTS Tokens in any securities exchange or automated quotation system. 

The PRTS Token is a digital token on the Ethereum Blockchain with an ability to execute code (smart contract). 

The PRTS Token is held in a digital wallet. The fact of the ownership is usually defined by the ownership of the 

private key that enables access to the digital wallet holding the PRTS Token. Private and public keys are 256-bit 

numbers, where the public key acts as an address and the private key controls the contents of the digital wallet. The 

TokenHub platform technically will hold all private keys to wallets holding PRTS Tokens owned by all of the 

TokenHub platform users, until such PRTS Tokens are transferred at users’ directions. 

The PRTS Token does not represent or qualify as an interest in the Issuer or the Fund and does not grant 

any equity or voting rights in, or claim against, the Issuer or the Fund. Furthermore, the PRTS Token is not, 

and does not represent or qualify as a fund unit or structured product. 

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you purchase, 

offer or sell any PRTS Tokens or possess or distribute this offering memorandum. You must also obtain any 

consents, permissions or approvals that you need in order to purchase, offer or sell any PRTS Tokens under 

the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such 

purchases, offers or sales. The Issuer is not responsible for your compliance with these legal requirements. 

We are not making any representation to you regarding the legality of your investment in the PRTS Tokens 

under any legal investment or similar law or regulation in any jurisdiction. 

We are offering the PRTS Tokens in the United States in reliance on exemptions from the registration 

requirements of the Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve 

a public offering. We are also relying on exemptions from the application of the securities laws of other 

jurisdictions. By purchasing any PRTS Tokens, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, 

representations and agreements as described in the “Transfer Restrictions” and “Notice to Subscribers” and 

“To Subscribers Generally” sections of this offering memorandum. You may be required to bear the financial 

risks of investing in the PRTS Tokens for an indefinite period of time. 

The PRTS Tokens have not been recommended by any federal, state, provincial, territorial or foreign 

securities authorities, nor have any such authorities determined that this offering memorandum is accurate 

or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.
