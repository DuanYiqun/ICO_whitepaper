COINTED is building a bridge between the cryptocurrency world and the real world. 
Even though cryptocurrencies have brought a whole new dimension in creating 
value, consumers regularly face the same problem: how can I easily change my 
cryptocurrencies into fiat currency? Additionally, consumers are also looking for 
easier and more secure ways to get their hands on cryptocurrencies in the first 
place. The goal is to satisfy the demand for convenient ways to convert fiat currency 
into cryptocurrencies and vice versa, without abandoning safety. 

Already cryptocurrencies are being adopted globally by consumers and the 
business world alike. As a commodity that is unrestricted by national borders, 
we strive to build a bridge between the real world and cryptocurrencies through 
future-oriented products and services. 

Unlike other projects in the cryptocurrency world - where business ideas are being 
presented without transparent roadmaps how those self-set goals are meant to 
be reached - Cointed already offers a wide range of working blockchain-based 
products and services. The company has a successful business model and is already 
profitable. 

- Cryptocurrency trading on the Cointed crypto exchange.

- Multi-Cryptocurrency ATMs, which we operate as the biggest provider in Europe.

- Payment Solutions, which can be integrated in online shops and existing cash 
register systems.

- Green Mining at multiple mining farms throughout Europe, keeping with our 
slogan „Mine green and save the planet“. Only through environmentally friendly 
mining with hydro- and wind power a sustainable growth of the blockchain can 
be ensured.

Additionally, we are currently in the final stages of acquiring a banking license.
Other upcoming requirements from authorities are also being evaluated in order 
to have a legal framework in place.

INTRODUCTION



12 13

The financial industry is evolving. The blockchain technology is and continues to 
revolutionize the way people interact with money. The introduction of Bitcoin, the first 
cryptocurrency, enabled people all over the world to transfer money, trade and pay for 
shopping across the world, within a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Even in the 
world of cryptocurrencies however, the dependence on third parties to undertake day 
-to-day financial related activities continues to grow. Already, there are developments 
in the blockchain world that seek to change the way people interact with banking 
systems.  We believe that the underlying factor that will continue to define blockchain 
products is the ability to give people more power and control over their finances. This 
is the driving force behind Cointed: providing a platform to the people, where they can 
freely move between crypto- and fiat currencies in a secure, fast and affordable online 
environment. 

Financial globalisation through an increasing number of international payments is an 
area that is estimated to continue growing. With cryptocurrencies, people are already 
able to make payments from and to anywhere around the world. 

Currently, the global payment landscape is a multibillion-dollar industry. Cross-border 
payments are basically facilitated by the exchange of one currency into another. Since 
cryptocurrencies transcend borders, they are the best bet in facilitating these payments 
and to streamline this long, complicated and costly process. By 2025, it is estimated 
that the global cross-border payments revenues will hit 5 trillion dollars. The majority of 
the revenue in this calculation is coming from developing markets which have faced 
challenges in facilitating payments across borders.

& PROBLEM

SOLUTIONS
CRYPTO ATMS

We have already installed Multi-
Cryptocurrency ATMs in 70 locations 
spanning 4 European countries. Every week 
new locations are added to our network. We 
offer two distinct ATM models, enabling us 
to adapt to a variety of market situations. Our 
compact one-way ATMs allow the customers 
to purchase a wide range of cryptocurrencies, 
while our two-way ATMs also offer the 
option to exchange cryptocurrencies for 
cash. Additionally, NFC support for digital 
payments will soon be added to all 
machines. The ATMs meet the highest 
quality and safety standards while 
requiring very little maintenance: with 
a power- and internet connection you 
are ready to go. We also offer mobile 
hardware solutions. 

While continuing the expansion 
throughout Europe, Cointed has 
already formed cooperations with 
partners in many South East Asian 
countries - such as Indonesia, Hong 
Kong and Japan to name a few - who 
will help with the distribution of our 
ATMs on a large scale.

With 15,000 active customers, the Cointed crypto exchange has experienced 
tremendous growth in a short time frame.

Thanks to a user-friendly design and the step-by-step payment process, we aim to prove 
just how easy trading cryptocurrencies can be - even for inexperienced users.

Additional options, like a customizeable interface, give more advanced users all the 
freedom they require to modify the platform according to their personal needs and 
preferences.

A Crypto Exchange, adjusted to your needs:

Cointed is permanently and actively working on improving the existing systems and 
services. Online wallet support for additional cryptocurrencies will soon be added, 
together with an ever-growing list of tradable cryptocurrencies.

An attractive and transparent affiliate program, which anyone can join, is already well 
underway: Our affiliate partners will receive 20% of all fees their recruited customers pay.

Development of iOS and Android smartphone apps for the exchange will soon begin, 
allowing you to never again miss rapid price fluctuations on the crypto market. We 
expect to deliver a finished product by mid 2018.

PAYMENT SOLUTIONS VIA THE PAYCO 
PAYMENT INTERFACE

With PayCo we offer a unique payment interface, unlike any product currently on the 
market. PayCo can be integrated in existing cash register systems and online shops,  
allowing merchants anywhere to accepts a variety of cryptocurrencies - like Bitcoin - 
as a method of payment. The merchants are given the choice whether they want to 
receive their payment in cryptocurrencies or immediately exchange the payment for a 
fiat currency.

PayCo will change the way payments are processed. Mobile hardware solutions have 
been developed for quick and easy payment processing and can be shipped out with 
the PayCo software.

Via an API interface, the same system can be integrated not only in online shops and 
cash register systems, but also for instance vending machines and smartphone apps.

To further improve our payments ecosystem, we are in the process of introducing the 
„Cointed Crypto Card“. Customers will be able to use the crypto card for shopping and 
other payments, without having to register an account and while being straightforward 
to use.

CRYPTOCURRENCY “GREEN” MINING 
Cointed is one of Europe‘s leading cryptocurrency mining companies, with multiple 
mining farms throughout Austria and Sweden. All our farms are 100% powered by 
renewable sources, such as hydro- and wind-power. In addition, we have developed 
specialised mining containers, that can easily be shipped anywhere our customers 
want to.

Unlike other mining providers, who simply outsource the actual work to third party 
cloud mining companies, we place a lot of value on influencing the development 
process from the very start.

Our subsidiary, the Switzerland-based Swiss Crypto Group, has been at the forefront 
of crypto mining developments, distributing custom-designed mining hardware for 
decentralised cryptographic networks - such as BTC, ETH, ETC, XMR and ZEC - as well 
as developing advanced BIOS and operating systems in-house.

Our operation is designed to require the lowest maintenance possible, without 
sacrificing efficiency. We achieve that goal by providing optimal cooling solutions and 
subsequently, making continuous operations a matter of course.

As Cointed is outgrowing its next mining farm - with 100,000 additional GPUs installed 
by the end of the year - we are actively looking for new locations.

A unique business model

Unlike cloud mining offers, where mining power is merely rented for a limited time, 
at Cointed you mine with your own hardware. The customer purchases the hardware 
directly from Cointed, together with a hosting contract.

COMPETITIVE 
ADVANTAGES

Decrease risk: Our goal is to create a safe and trustworthy environment for the 
community to trade and access their cryptocurrencies.

Lower cost: We aim to reduce the service fees that are offered by payment 
aggregators. In the current market, cross border payments processing takes up 
to 5%-8% of the total amount. Furthermore, the buyers have to wait for days, 
sometimes weeks for payments to be processed. As a businessperson, this is not 
sustainable because it slows business operations. We aim to not only offer low 
costs, but a seamless and transparent payment process as well.

Merchants get a wider client base: By accepting cryptocurrencies as means of 
payment, merchants will be able to attract whole new groups of customers since 
cryptocurrencies know no borders or other limitations. This will enable them to 
expand their operations to new markets and offer additional goods and services.

For initial token backers: Those taking part in the ICO have an opportunity 
to fund a project with real value beyond mere speculation. Apart from being 
tradable on the Cointed crypto exchange, the CTD token will be used to lower 
the fees of virtually all Cointed services and to access exclusive hard- and software. 
To gain access to these benefits, the customer needs to transfer the CTD token to 
Cointed, resulting in a smaller supply on the market. Holders of the CTD token will, 
therefore see a gradual appreciation in value with time.

WHAT IS AN INITIAL COIN OFFERING?
An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a modern crowdfunding instrument for startup 
companies via cryptocurrencies. In exchange the investors gain access to features of 
the projects being funded.

The advantage of an ICO is that it allows the community to be directly involved in the 
process. They also provide a way to bypass much slower traditional funding routes and 
therefore enable the startups to speed up the realisation process of the projects.

WHY WE ARE DOING AN ICO 
We choose to do an ICO because we want the community to join us in shaping 
the financial market of the future. ICOs have given people an opportunity to invest 
in forward-looking ideas that are set to gain more traction with time. Instead of only 
giving wealthy investors a chance to participate, ICOs enable anyone to take part in 
revolutionary ideas they believe in. Already there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies in 
the market and we anticipate that this trend will continue. Emerging blockchain-based 
technologies, like smart contracts, demonstrate that the age of cryptocurrencies is only 
just beginning. Due to the emergence of modern platforms that allow customers to 
exchange cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and vice versa, the adoption and usage 
of cryptocurrencies is expected to soar. Cointed is at the forefront of this digital currency 
revolution. As the cryptocurrency adoption rate continues to grow, an increasing 
number of technically inexperienced people will be looking for safe and easy ways to 
gain access to cryptocurrencies. Thanks to our products and services, the barrier of entry 
for cryptocurrencies has never been lower which is why we are optimistic regarding 
the long-term outlook for us and our investors alike. Furthermore, investors will have a 
chance to first hand witness and contribute to the development of various blockchain-
based products and technologies, some of which are already well into development 
and will soon be revealed.

payment experience, with high quality offerings and variety of integrations, we need 
additional funding. We will be able twhitepaper and 

form new partnerships. 

Furthermore, in the current world of cryptocurrency, we believe that launching our 
own token will be crucial in enhancing our future plans to bring true change in the 
payments, trading and crypto mining landscape.

REFUND OPTIONS
Refunds can occur in the following situations:

An attempted token purchase at the end of a phase might get partially refunded for 
those funds which exceed the phase limit. -> Partial Refund

A token purchase after the ICO‘s completion. -> Full Refund

No token purchases can be refunded as the contract has no minimum funding goal.

Refunds are not directly send back, but must be withdrawn using the withdraw function.

Token buyers are notified of a pending withdrawal with the Withdrawal event.

These refunds cannot be accessed by the owner for 30 days after the completion of 
the ICO. Afterwards, the owner can withdraw unclaimed refunds using the returnWei 
function.

EXTRA FEATURES
Pausable

The owner has the power to pause the token sale and/or circulation once for the 
duration of two weeks. During this time no token transfers, token purchases or refunds 
can be made.

Upgradable

The owner can propose a token upgrade to a new token version. This can happen at 
any time.

Individual token owners can accept the upgrade by calling the upgrade function.

Owner Limits

The contract limits the owner’s power during the ICO. During the ICO the contract 
owner cannot transfer any tokens.

Safe Defaults

Should the owner fail to perform a proper setup before the start of the token sale, then 
the contract will automatically assign its owner to critical functions.

WHY WE ARE DOING AN ICO 
We choose to do an ICO because we want the community to join us in shaping 
the financial market of the future. ICOs have given people an opportunity to invest 
in forward-looking ideas that are set to gain more traction with time. Instead of only 
giving wealthy investors a chance to participate, ICOs enable anyone to take part in 
revolutionary ideas they believe in. Already there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies in 
the market and we anticipate that this trend will continue. Emerging blockchain-based

gain access to cryptocurrencies. Thanks to our products and services, the barrier of entry

the long-term outlook for us and our investors alike. Furthermore, investors will have a 
chance to first hand witness and contribute to the development of various blockchain-
based products and technologies, some of which are already well into development 
and will soon be revealed.

The funds raised at the ICO will be mainly used for product development. In order 
to provide our users with a seamless cryptocurrency payment experience, with high 
quality offerings and variety of integrations, we need additional funding. We will be able 
to expand our team with tech, legal and administrative experts, launch new products 
as outlined in this whitepaper and form new partnerships. 

Furthermore, in the current world of cryptocurrency, we believe that launching our 
own token will be crucial in enhancing our future plans to bring true change in the 
payments, trading and crypto mining landscape.

Traditional ventures are restricted to an elite minority. Thanks to ICOs, this is no longer 
the case. We are convinced that the community plays an important part in improving 
the crypto world and wish for your to participate in the future growth of Cointed.

Moving forward, our products and services will receive new features and discounts 
through CTD tokens. CTD will form the backbone of the Cointed network.

With the raised funds our expansion - which is already well under way - will be sped up 
even further. Those funds will be used to hire specialists and to lay the groundwork for 
entering new markets.

Only through easily accessible products and services - which even the layman can use 
- will it be possible to disrupt and challenge the traditional financial service industry, 
which is the only way the cryptocurrency landscape can grow sustainably over the long 
term.

THE CTD TOKEN 
You can use the CTD token to reap the benefits of our products and services , spend 
it at merchants who accept CTD tokens as means of payment or sell the token on an 
exchange as well as privately. The key difference to most other tokens is that the CTD 
token has a solid business model behind it: A wide range of proven products and services, 
that will unlock new features and benefits with the help of the CTD token. Through a 
community-driven effort, additional attractive benefits will be unlocked as the company 
grows.

As the CTD token grows, we expect it to be 
listed on several exchanges. Naturally, 
it will be available on the Cointed 
crypto exchange from the very 
start.



32 33

CTD TOKEN BENEFITS
You will be able to use the CTD token in combination with all of Cointed‘s products and 
services to lower your fees, to participiate in polls and to purchase exclusive software 
and hardware. To ensure that the price of the CTD token develops favorably in the 
long term, most benefits will require the spent tokens to be burned (i.e. send them to 
0x0000... address) in order to take advantage of them.

Early Investors

Everyone investing in the Pre-ICO phase from October 20 to November 19 will receive 
15% bonus CTD tokens with every investment (limited to 130M CTD tokens).

Additionally, the first 1,000 investors during the ICO who commit a minimum of 20 ETH 
will also receive the limited Cointed Black Crypto Card* for free.

VOTING
Cryptocurrencies have always been driven by the community. As a CTD token holder, 
Cointed offers you the option to vote on a variety of our business decisions. Thus, you 
will have the opportunity to actively influence which services we shall provide for our 
customers going forward.

We want to give the community the possibility to actively influence the direction in 
which Cointed develops. After much consideration, the CTD token has proven to be the 
ideal tool to put this plan into effect.

Who Can Vote?

All token holders who have a verified account on the Cointed platform and who hold 
ANY amount of CTD tokens will be eligible to participate in these votes. Each token 
holder is allowed to open one account on the platform and vote once.

What Will Be Voted On?

Token holders will mainly vote on which cryptocurrencies will be available next on 
the Cointed exchange, ATMs and Crypto debit cards. Additionally, token holders will 
regularly vote on which cryptocurrency shall receive a temporary fee reduction on the 
Cointed exchange.

How Does It Work?

All users can make a proposal on our platform at the cost of 100 CTD tokens, which will 
eventually be burned by sending them to the 0x000000... ETH address. If the proposal 
is accepted by Cointed, the community will be able to vote on whether it shall be 
accepted or not. Casting a vote will cost 10 CTD tokens, which will also eventually be 
burned. The more tokens you hold, the more points your vote will be worth. See table 1 
in the appendix (p. 41) for details.

Example: A user spends 100 CTD to make the proposal that Mooncoin should be 
implemented on the Cointed debit cards. If we accept the proposal, a vote will be innitiated 
on the Cointed platfrom. Each CTD token holder can now cast a weighted vote at the 
cost of 10 CTD. If the majority of the votes are in favor of the proposal, Cointed will begin

ATMS
Benefit 1: Reduced Trading Fees        

At Cointed, we offer one of the lowest fees on our multi-cryptocurrency ATMs available 
in the industry. You can expect our fees to usually be between 2%-4%. You will soon 
be able to pay your fees with CTD tokens, which will lower them even further - by 
up to 60%! First, simply deposit CTD tokens on your Cointed online wallet. When 
purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies at the ATM, log into your Cointed account and 
choose the option to pay the fee using the CTD tokens you deposited*. The fee will 
then be discounted according to table 2 in the appendix (p.41).    
Tokens spent this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Peter has 1,000 CTD tokens in his CTD online wallet on the Cointed platform. 
Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. He now wants to convert 1 BTC back to 
EUR at an exchange rate of 1 BTC = 15,000€ and a fee of 3% at the ATM. The trading 
fee would be 450€ (15000*3%) in this case. If Peter chooses to pay the fee using his 
deposited CTD tokens instead, he would only pay 180 CTD and thus save 60% according 
to table 2 in the appendix (p.41)!

Peter would have 820 CTD tokens left in his online wallet.

Benefit 2: Discount On ATMs  

Partners will receive a 15% discount when purchasing an ATM using CTD tokens*.  
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. Buying a two-way ATM costs 
9,000€. When purchasing the ATM with CTD tokens, the price is reduced by 15% to 7650 
CTD.

Benefit 3: ATM Whitelabel Solutions

Cointed will offer custom whitelabel solutions to ATM partners who own CTD tokens.

*The price of the CTD token is determined by the CTD token price on the Cointed 
crypto exchange at the time of the purchase.

CRYPTO CARD
Benefit 1: Free Limited Debit Card For Early Investors

Early investors, who invested a minimum of 20 ETH into the CTD ICO will receive a 
limited Cointed Crypto Card “Black Edition” as a thank you - completely free of charge! 
Owners of a “Black Edition” Crypto Card will receive a lifetime 40% discount on all 
transaction fees.

The standard fee we will charge will be ~2.5% for foreign exchange purchases, which is 
17% lower than competitors like XAPO. “Black Edition” card holders will have these fees 
lowered by 40% to 1.5%!

Benefit 2: Reduced Foreign Exchange Purchase Fees

Regular Crypto Card users will be able to pay their foreign exchange purchase fees - 
which will be ~2.5% - using CTD tokens, reducing the fee by up to 30%! You will first 
have to deposit funds on your CTD token online wallet. Once the tokens have been 
deposited, you can toggle the option that all future fees shall be paid using the CTD 
tokens in your online wallet*. The fee will then be discounted according to table 2 
in the appendix (p.41).          
Tokens spent this way will eventually be burned.

Example: John has 1,000 CTD tokens in his CTD online wallet on the Cointed platform. 
Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1$. He now wants to pay a 2,000$ (foreign 
currency) bill using his Crypto Card with a fee of 2.5% per foreign purchase. The fee would 
be 50$ (2000*2.5%) in this case. If John chooses to pay the fee using his deposited CTD 
tokens instead, he would only pay 35 CTD and thus save 30% according to table 2 in the 
appendix (p.41)!

John would have 965 CTD tokens left in his online wallet.

*The price of the CTD token is determined by the CTD token price on the Cointed 
crypto exchange at the time of the purchase.



38 39

EXCHANGE
Benefit: Reduced Trading Fees

Similarly to the ATM benefit, exchange customers will be able to use CTD tokens, which 
have been deposited in their Cointed online wallet, to pay the trading fees for their 
orders. Fees on the Cointed crypto exchange are usually between 0.2%-1.5%, depending 
on the payment method and type of order. These fees can be lowered by up to 60% 
when using CTD tokens to pay them*, as seen in table 2 in the appendix (p. 41).  
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Alexandra has 1,000 CTD tokens in her CTD online wallet on the Cointed 
platform. Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. She now wants to purchase 1 
BTC with EUR at an exchange rate of 1 BTC = 15,000€ and a fee of 1%. The trading fee 
would be 150€ (15000*1%) in this case. If Alexandra chooses to pay the fee using her 
deposited CTD tokens instead, she would only pay 60 CTD and thus save 60% according 
to table 2 in the appendix (p. 41)! Alexandra would have 940 CTD tokens left in her online 
wallet.

PAYCO
Benefit 1: Reduced Fees For Partners

Our partners will be able to pay the transaction fee - which is usually around 1.2% - 
of all orders made via the PayCo system using CTD tokens, reducing the fee by 20%! 
The partner will first have to deposit funds on his/her CTD token online wallet. Once 
the tokens have been deposited, the partner can toggle the option that all future 
transaction fees shall be paid using the CTD tokens in his/her online wallet*. The fee will 
then be discounted according to table 2 in the appendix (p. 41).   
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Our partner has 1,000 CTD tokens in his CTD online wallet on the Cointed 
platform. Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 0.001 BTC. A customer of his now 
pays a 2 BTC bill using the Cointed PayCo system. The fee for this transaction would 
usually be 1.2%. The transaction fee would thus be 0.024 BTC (2*1.2%) in this case. If our 
partner chooses to pay the fee using his deposited CTD tokens (0.024 BTC = 24 CTD) 
instead, he would only pay 19.2 CTD and thus save 20%!

Our partner would have 980.8 CTD tokens left in his online wallet.

*The price of the CTD token is determined by the CTD token price on the Cointed 
crypto exchange at the time of the purchase.

Benefit 2: Discount On POS Hardware 

When purchasing POS hardware, you will be able to choose CTD tokens as a payment 
option*. For POS hardware purchased with CTD tokens, customers will receive a 15% 
discount on their purchase.         
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. Buying a POS system costs 
500€. When purchasing the POS hardware with CTD tokens, the price is reduced by 15% 
to 425 CTD.

Benefit 3: Profit Sharing For Partners 

Our partners will have the option to accept CTD tokens as payment through the PayCo 
system. When choosing to do so, our partners will receive a profit share of 5% from fees 
paid through the PayCo system with CTD token payments.

Benefit 4: Whitelabel

Cointed will offer custom whitelabel solutions to PayCo partners who own CTD tokens.

MINING BENEFITS
Benefit 1: Reduced Hosting Fee 

For mining hardware hosted by Cointed, customers can spend 1,000 CTD tokens per 
mining rig to reduce their hosting fee by 10% for 8 months (minimum hosting period). 
This allows our customers to enjoy a higher rate of return for their weekly payout, which 
benefits them in the long run.        
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: If the hosting fee was 40% (standard fee), the hosting fee would be reduced 
to 36% with this discount. The customer would thus receive 64% instead of 60% of the 
miner‘s total hashpower for his weekly payout.

*The price of the CTD token is determined by the CTD token price on the Cointed 
crypto exchange at the time of the purchase.



40 41

Benefit 2: Discount On Mining Hardware

When purchasing mining hardware, you will be able to choose CTD tokens as a payment 
option*. For mining hardware purchased with CTD tokens, customers will receive a 
15% discount on their purchase.         
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. Buying a mining rig costs 3,000€. 
When purchasing mining hardware with CTD tokens, the price is reduced by 15% to 2,550 
CTD.

Benefit 3: Mining Rigs With Increased Hashrate

Mining Rigs with ~25% increased hashpower can exclusively be purchased with CTD 
tokens. This boost in hashing power is achieved with in-house designed software. The 
fixed price for this hardware is 10,000 CTD per rig.     
Tokens spend this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Mining rigs which use 9x custom Rx470 GPUs (~26 MH/s standard ETH hashrate) 
will achieve a hashrate of 280MH/s - 290MH/s [ETH] (9 x 26 x 1.25).

Benefit 4: BIOS Licensing

You will be able to purchase our in-house developed BIOS with CTD tokens exclusively. 
This enables p106 and Rx470 GPUs to mine with a ~25% increased hashrate while also 
lowering their power consumption. The price for this BIOS will be 100 CTD tokens per 
GPU. Tokens spent this way will be burned.

Example: A Rx470 GPU with a hashrate of 26 MH/s will have its hashrate increased to 32 
MH/s on average, using the improved BIOS.

ONLINE SHOP
Benefit: Discount On All Purchases

When purchasing products in the Cointed online shop, you will be able to choose 
CTD tokens as a payment option*. For all purchases made with CTD tokens, you will 
receive a 10% discount.          
Tokens spent this way will eventually be burned.

Example: Let us assume an exchange rate of 1 CTD = 1€. Buying a Ledger Nano S costs 
90€. When purchasing the Ledger Nano S with CTD tokens, the price is reduced by 15% 
to 81 CTD.

*The price of the CTD token is determined by the CTD token price on the Cointed 
crypto exchange at the time of the purchase.

USE OF FUNDS

USE OF FUNDS
As Cointed is continuing its international growth, 
the raised funds from the ICO will be used to lay 
the foundation to enter the global market. This 
means that after the ICO we will be expanding   
our   teams,   as   well as form partnerships with 
distributers from around the world.

IT DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS 
We plan to recruit a global dedicated team of 25 in-house developers within the next 
2 years. Talented and well-qualified blockchain developers are expensive and hard to 
find. We foresee that a considerable portion of the funds raised will need to be invested 
into establishing this team. The remaining budget will be used to cover any further 
costs that arise due to the development of our products and services.

NON-TECHNICAL MANPOWER 
At Cointed, our goal is to bring our proven products and services from Europe to the 
global market. As we continue expanding into new markets, additional non-technical 
staff in departments such as marketing, law, finance, HR, administration and customer 
support will need to be recruited in different parts of the world, Additionally, new 
members will be added to the core team.

MARKETING (TRADITIONAL - DIGITAL)
Cointed‘s main goal has always been to make the access to cryptocurrencies as easy 
as possible. Only through intuitive products and services, which even technically 
inexperienced consumers are able to use, can the continued growth of the crypto-
world be ensured for the long term. That‘s why - next to further improving our digital 
marketing campaign - Cointed will start investing in traditional media channels with 
the goal to grow the crypto-community as a whole.

LICENSING, INTEGRATIONS & PARTNERSHIPS 
As Cointed bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional banking as well 
as payment services, we operate in a heavily regulated space. 

While working with numerous service providers and partners worldwide, it will become 
unavoidable for Cointed to acquire its own licenses. This includes, but is not limited to 
areas such as: e-money, asset management, card issuance and online trading. Proper 
licensing will be required for every regulatory framework and geographical locations.

COMPANY HISTORY 
& ROADMAP

COMPANY HISTORY
At Cointed we are guided by the principle that in the IT service industry you have to keep 
innovating and introducing new products in order to stay competitive. Additionally, as a 
young and dynamic sector, the cryptocurrency world is constantly in motion. This forces 
companies to proactively adapt to the development of the market situation, following 
the motto: The early bird gets the worm.



48 49

Our numbers speak for themselves. We are not just inviting the community and investors 
to take part in an idea with an unspecified timeframe but a working product line. We 
have the customers and the revenue to back up our claims and want you to be a part 
of our success story. 

GLOBAL EXPANSION

Our goal is to  bring our blockchain-based products and services to the global market.
