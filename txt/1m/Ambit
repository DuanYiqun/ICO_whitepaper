Ambit Mining is a mining operation established in the free economic zone, Tbilisi,
Georgia. In October Ambit Mining completed the construction of its first fully
disclosed and diversified Mining farm, with the capacity of 1 Megawat (MW). Ambit
Mining aims to expand the existing operation with crowdfunding (using Ethereum
based smart contract) and make a large scale cryptocurrency mining operation
accessible to community.

Low cost, green electricity (0.05$ per kW/h), favorable government regulations, tax
free zone, cutting edge technological solutions, all these factors ensure that Ambit
Mining is one of the most profitable mining operations in the world. (100% ROI
Achieved in just 5 months for the existing farm). Community members who will
contribute to this project will have the opportunity to become part of the mining
family at Ambit. Each Community Member will have access to regular and
transparent information regarding the mining operation.

Ambit Mining contributors will receive Ethereum based AMBT Tokens that
represent their share in Ambit Mining. These tokens will entitle the holders to the
profit share from the Ambit Mining operation. 85% of the net profit will be available
for token holders (Total Mining Yield), out of this 85%, 75% will be distributed as divi-
dends, the remaining 25% will be reinvested to improve and upgrade our mining infru-
structure, in order to match the increasing mining dificulty and maintain the same ROI 
over the years. If the cost of the actual reinvestment is less than 25%, then the remain-
ing funds will be distributed as dividends as well.

On the existing mining operation, Ambit Mining has managed to achieve 100% ROI
in just 5 months. However, due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the ROI might vary 
significantly. With currently available mining equipment and mining di�culty rate, at 
bitcoin prices of USD 11,000, Ambit Token will generate a yearly ROI of
141%, or over 400% over 3 year period. Which means that every 1 ETH invested will
yield 4 ETH within 3 year timeframe.

In total there will be 104 million Ambit Tokens issued, out of which 85% will be
available for crowdsale. The reminder will be allocated as follows: Team & Advisors 9%,
Bounty Campaign 3%, Company Reserve 3%. All unsold tokens will be burned
and there will be no further distribution of the tokens. All tokens allocated to team
and advisors, will be vested for 6months, to ensure their in in the success of
Ambit Mining.

MARKET OVERVIEW/BACKGROUND

The interest and demand for crypto currencies is reaching an all time high across the 
world, as more and more people are becoming familiar with the concept of crypto 
currency and all underlying technologies. One of the most accessible ways to get 
involved in the crypto world and acquire crypto assets is mining. Currently there 
are 3 types of crypto mining solutions that are available on the market:

    Home Mining
    Cloud Mining
    Building a Proprietary Mining Facility

The first two options are intended for private party mining operations, while the 
latter is designed for businesses. However, all of the options are associated with 
corresponding risks and have their disadvantages including:

Home mining is costly and demanding:

     High electricity cost
      Constant noise and heat, which many find objectionable
     Large space allocation required for miners
     

Cloud mining is opaque and might contain many hidden costs:

     No knowledge of their equipment’s brand name, model number, serial number
     
     No breakdown of costs
     Most often no disclosure of mining pool or even the location of the facility

Mining facility is costly and requires expert knowledge to operate:

     Large investment needed to set up the operation
     Significant number of professionals are required to maintain the full sized farm

and profitablity of the mining operation, whilst avoiding all the disadvantages of home
and cloud mining. Unlike the traditional cloud mining services, Ambit Mining will be 
entirely transparent when it comes to the equipment, mining pools, costs and 
profits. Moreover, token holders will have a voting right to participate and 

extremely low electricity cost (0.05 USD) and the hard-earned experience over 
time, Ambit Mining can ensure that it can provide advantages over other types of 
mining operations and services. Ambit Mining will allow its token holders to 
purchase any fraction or whole professional mining rigs, and disclose all related

ensure the full transparency on the token holders miners’ performance and 
profitability. 

The profit-squeeze in mining is mainly due to the constant return reduction of 

time. In order to address these issues, a portion of the profits (25%) from the 
operation will be reinvested, to at least keep the mining returns constant, and even 
improve the return over time.

OVERVIEW OF AMBIT MINING PROJECT

Ambit Mining History

Ambit Mining is an organization that was established in summer 2017, and is part of the bigger
BFGroup Holding that also controls several business in Georgia such as petrol stations, poultry farm
and an international audit firm.

In November 2017, Ambit Mining completed the construction of its first fully functional and diversified
Mining farm in the Free Economic Zone, Tbilisi, Georgia, with the capacity of 1 MW. Following the
success and profitability of the farm (expected 100% ROI in just 5 months), now Ambit Mining provides an
opportunity for the token holders to become part of the mining family and further expand the
existing, profitable mining operation to reach up to 20 MW capacity. Ambit will run diversified
mining equipment - both ASICs and GPU rigs, in order to mitigate the risks and market volatility of

Mining ICO allows the individuals interested in crypto currency mining to enter the mining
operation and share the profits of the future operation.

Project Summary

the electricity cost as low as 0.05 USD/kW/hour in the Free Economic Zone in Tbilisi, it makes our mining 
facility one of the most competitive in the world. Ambit Mining can support up to 20 Mega Watt capacity for its 
miners which will mine all key scalable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash etc. 
whichever will be the most profitable at the time.

In order to minimize the risk of market volatility and for full transparency, Ambit Mining will be diversified, 

a hosting facility which will accommodate up to 5 MW electricity, and will provide an extra income source for 
the token holders. All profits earned through the hosting operations will be evenly distributed to the token 
holders. This allows us to commence payments as soon as the hosting facility is completed. This diversification of 
income sources will allow the flexibility and minimization of risks, and reduce the inherent market uncertainty.

All token holders will be entitled to 85% of net profits from the mining operations. Out of which 75% will be paid

will be calculated and paid on bi-weekly basis in ETH. The size of the dividend will be determined in a pro-rata 
share of the tokens held by token holders during a full dividend cycle (every 2 weeks) before the dividend 
declaration. (for example if an user held 100 tokens in the beginning of the cycle, and sold 30 during the cycle, 
dividend will be allocated for the remaining 70 tokens which were held during the full duration of the dividend 
cycle).

A portion of the profits from the mining (25%) will be bootstrapped into further development and innovation of 

information regarding the upgrade of the equipment as well as other related development costs will be fully 
transparent and available to the token holders, to ensure the credibility and transparency of the project.

BENEFITS OF AMBIT MINING

ambitmining.io          contact@AmbitMining.io          +995595882255          Khizanishvili Street #264, Tbilisi Technological Park Free Industrial Zone, Georgia

Due to its geographic location, Georgia has an
abundance of water sources and green electricity. 
All of our mining units are powered by 100% 
renewable hydro energy, ensuring lowcost and clean 
electricity at only 5 cents per kw/h.

Green Electricity
Ambit mining is located in Tbilisi Free Industrial Zone
(TFZ) (http://tfz.ge/en), in Georgia, one of the most 
crypto friendly countries in the world. This 
strategic location allows for a safe operation and 
favorable government regulations. TFZ is a locked 
area with security guards operating 24/7 and 
access to the premises is restricted to 
unauthorized personnel.

Location

Ambit mining has already constructed 1 MW 
diversified mining farm in Georgia, which is 
profitable and generates over 1.3 mln USD per 
year. With this experience we aim to further 
expand our operations and enable mining 
enthusiasts to participate in this project

Experience
TFZ is a tax free zone, which means that income of 
a Free Industrial Zone enterprise is exempt from 
the Corporate Income Tax, interest and dividend 
paid by a Free Industrial Zone Enterprise is not 
taxed and is not included in the taxable income 
base of the receiver. The trade in TFZ is also VAT 
free which means a significant benefit when 
purchasing mining equipment.

Tax Free

Ambit Mining plans to purchase the best available 
mining equipment (ASICs and GPUs) available at 
the market at the end of ICO. However, what 

Ambit plans to install cutting edge cooling and wiring
solutions to optimize the costs and to ensure maximum 
profitability.

Technology
Access to TFZ is restricted to unauthorized 
personnel; around the clock security means that 
no one enters the zone without permission. 
Additionally, our farm will be equipped with 24/7 
CCTV cameras which will provide live footage of 
the facility.

After the crowdfunding announcement, Ambit Mining will begin to collect funds. 
We will be utilizing the highest level of security to ensure security of all deposited 
funds. All tokens bought by ETH will be automatically credited to investors’ Ether 
Wallet. Tokens bought with BTC and USD will be issued manually during and 
upon completion of the crowdfunding ICO. 

After the ICO, a full development cycle will commence, to build our enhanced 
Mine Dashboard, Blockchain API and management software. The Mine will be 
connected to the user interface dashboard through the API. The Mine will submit 
real time data to our portal, which will collect all information from the Mine and 
display data to our token holders. This data will include daily mining stats, daily 
mining returns, daily blocks found, and all other data pertaining to the operation of 
the Mine. All the information submitted can be verified. This process allows for the 
creation a fully transparent mining operation safeguarding your profit share.

Overall, even with quite reserved assumptions of cryptocurrencies, the mining farm provides 
an opportunity to invest in a high return on investment project. What’s more important is 
the fact, that this is an already existing profitable business model, we are a team with a 
proven track record, and we aim to further expand our existing operation. By the end of 1 
full year of operations we aim to provide 141% ROI to the token holders (in a balanced 
scenario with BTC price at $11,000). Assuming the growth in popularity of the crypto 
currencies and the previous trends where every year the price of BTC has at least doubled, 
it’s a fair assumption that mining returns might be even higher that shown in the table 
above. Of course, there is also the possibility that the price of cryptocurrencies might also 
fall. The beauty of the investment in mining project is the possibility to be profitable even in 
an unlikely scenario when BTC Price drops to 3,000 USD. The Ambit mining operation will 
remain profitable and yield a 18% return on investment even at that rate.

DATA SECURITY AND KYC

    
   the  token sale will be specified on our website ambitmining.io, use only the  

   be your liability.

    Do not send funds directly from your cryptocurrency exchange account or you   
   will lose your tokens. You need to have a full Ethereum wallet, not a trading  
   account.

    If you do not have local Ethereum wallet software like Mist or Parity on your 
   computer, you can use a free web wallet https://myetherwallet.com.

    Do not trust emails related to the ICO sale, do not send funds to the addresses   
   provided in the mail as email addresses can be forged and you can be scammed  
   by fraudsters. We will never send the ETH address via email.

    Token sale investors accept that the final terms of the actual sale are not yet   
   available.

   Funds can only be forwarded to the token sale or refunded. Refunds are 
   calculated after transaction fees are deducted.

   If the token sale doesn’t happen, soft cap is not reached or gets delayed,  
   the presale contract allows participants to claim automatic refunds after May  
   10th, 2018.

   Tokens purchased in ETH will be credited automatically to your ETH wallet.

   Tokens purchased with BTC or USD will be credited manually to the ETH Wallet 
   address provided by investor.

   All transactions are non-refundable if the soft cap of $3 million is reached.

   To comply with international AML rules, all investors must undertake KYC in 
   order to activate their tokens. The objective of KYC is to prevent identity theft, 
   money laundering, and terrorist financing.

   Purchases of tokens should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or 
   companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the 
   usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like Bitcoin (“BTC”), and 
   blockchain-based software systems.

   Ambit Mining will not be responsible for lost funds resulting from actions taken 
   by, for omitted by purchasers.

RISKS

See below for some of the risks inherent in cryptocurrencies and ICOs in general.

    The risk of failure to fund the project is present. We will fully refund all token     
   holders to their payment wallet addresses, less transaction fees, should this   
   unlikely event occur.

   The Ambit Mining Token (AMBT) may be influenced by market trends once listed   
   on the exchanges. The value of AMBT may be influenced by events out of  
   control of the cryptosphere, including fraud, legislative changes, tax treatment  
   changes, new disruptive technologies and organized crime.

   AMBT may not ever be tradable on the exchanges.

   The mining software may not meet expectations. There are many points of   

   squeeze profit margins into insignificance after costs.

   Construction timeline specified in the whitepaper is based on the reasonable  
   estimates, but it is not guaranteed.

   Alternative technologies may be developed that negate the need for 
   cryptomining and related services. This is one of the strengths of Ambit   
   Mining, because if one product line fails for unforeseen events, then the revenue    
   from hosting services is still available for the organization use as a source of income..

   pricing changes. Most of the ICO funds will be spent immediately on mining 
   hardware, so this risk does still exist for some of the funds held in   
   cryptocurrencies produced by mining activities and not yet distributed as profit 
   share.

   Tokens may in future fall under as yet undefined tax law changes, which could 

   The Tokens could also face the risk of limited or no liquidity in the market. 
   Should this happen you will not be able to sell your tokens on the exchanges.

   Breakthroughs in the field of cryptographic technology could destabilize the   
   whole industry. An example of this would be the use of quantum computers to 
   mine Proof-of Work coins and therefore mine all available coin resources in a 
   very short space of time. However, should this happen, the traditional banking

   There are no guarantees that the Tokens will increase in value; volatility in the 
   crypto exchanges mean that the price of this Token might, at some point in the 
   future, come down.

   It is possible that the organization will fail to launch or if launched, will fail to   
   meet profitability targets set out in the Business Model document.

   Ambit Mining performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to 
   force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force 
   majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be 
   prevented by Ambit Mining and shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed 
   conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, 
   prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication 
   service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other 
   circumstances beyond Ambit Mining’s control, which were not in existence at 
   the time of Token Launch.
