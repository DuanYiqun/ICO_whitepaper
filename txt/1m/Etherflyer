1. Abstract 
This white paper describes EtherFlyer, a decentralized digital currency 

trading platform based on Ethereum smart contracts that supports ERC-20 

type tokens and other token types. The EtherFlyer Encrypted Currency 

Trading Platform is a one-stop, global trading platform that runs on multiple 

interactive environments including Windows, Chrome, IE and Firefox, 

Android, and iOS, delivering a global, weather-ready mix of tokens fluidity. 

TCASH, a local token for the EtherFlyer trading platform, is tightly controlled 

at 88 million. Supporting all Ethereum wallets, TCASH is the platform's 

revenue distribution token, allowing each platform participant to share the 

opportunities and fortunes of crypto-economic giving. 

 

2. Background 
2.1 Explosive growth of Cryptocurrency  

Since Satoshi's operation of the Bitcoin blockchain in January 2009, there 

has been a gradual realization of a decentralized, point-to-point digital 

currency that maintains its own without any asset guarantees, central 

issuers value. As the market value of Bitcoin continues to rise, it has 

attracted the attention of a large public worldwide. At the same time, other 

cryptographic digital currencies based on blockchain and other technologies 

have also developed rapidly, with different functions and digital currency for 

different application scenarios successively developed.  

 

According coincoincap.com website statistics, as of August 2017, the global 

market value of encrypted currency has reached 100 billion US dollars; the 

same time, the global daily trading volume reached an alarming 5 billion US 

dollars. In addition to bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are emerging with new 

features and technologies, and their total value and volume account for 

more than 50% of the global market. Currently, the world's top 10 platform 

daily transaction volume has reached 100 million US dollars, and still 

maintain the momentum of rapid development. 

 

Among them, in 2015, Turing completed the Ethereum operation, enabling 

digital currencies to run smart contract functions simultaneously. A smart 

contract is more than just a computer program that can be executed 

automatically: it is itself a system participant. It responds to received 

messages, it can receive and store values, and can send out messages and 

values as well. All financial contracts can be written as smart contracts in the 

form of program code. 

 

It is foreseeable that with the progress of blockchain technology, more and 

more people will migrate from the legal system based on the financial 

system to the financial system based on the blockchain.

2.2 Centralized Exchange  

Centralized exchange trading patterns can be divided into transaction-

dominated exchange floor, and quotations dominate the OTC. Because over

-the-counter transactions are not transparent and trades involve many risks 

and uncontrollable factors, people generally choose to trade on the floor. 

Unless there are special circumstances, they conduct over-the-counter 

transactions. 

 

The central venue exchange needs to be responsible for functions such as 

user account management, KYC, asset reloading, asset custody, transaction 

matching, asset clearing, asset withdrawals, performance guarantee, and 

new currency launches. However, at every link there may exist Risks and 

problems, thus giving users a safety loss. Since the MTGOX bitcoin theft, the 

issue of exchange security is frequent, in the final analysis due to the 

untrustworthy centralization endorsement as a third party endorsement, 

inevitably insider operations, hacking, misappropriation of assets, Many 

security risks. 

  

2.3 Decentralized Exchange  

Compared with the centralized exchange, to the central exchange business 

is much simpler, the user assets always in the user's own or open source 

under the control of the smart contract code, the user does not need to 

provide personal information to the exchange, asset transfer does not 

require any artificial Audit. 

 

Some decentralized exchanges are decentralized in themselves, but they 

have a central banker at the capital and tokens chargers, and the acceptors 

receive funds and token acceptance services by charging a fee The 

bustlingness of these exchanges, the depth of trade is not enough, and 

many tokens can not buy the dilemma. 

 

Ethereum market capitalization has reached 32 billion US dollars, in line with 

ERC-20 agreement to develop thousands of tokens, Ethereum-based 

decenter of the exchange EtherFlyer can be used directly Ethereum wallet 

address transactions, digital assets are free to enter and exit, not Need to 

charge the acceptor, the exchange can be short-term high popularity and 

depth of the transaction. 

 

3. EtherFlyer Exchange Platform 
EtherFlyer Exchange Server is a trading backend with high-speed 

performance, designed for cryptocurrency exchanges. It can support up to 

10000 trades every second and real-time user/market data notification 

though websocket.

3.1 Platform Architecture and Modules 

We are building a safety, riskless and user friendly interface for 
cryptocurrency trading, which we believe EtherFlyer outstands other 
exchange platforms. 

 

<Architecture> 

・Apache Kafka: 

A distributed streaming platform.The project aims to provide a unified, high-
throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Its 
storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue 
architected as a distributed transaction log. 

・Redis:  

An open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a 
database, cache and message broker.In order to achieve its outstanding 
performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. 

・MySQL:  

An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). For 
saving operation log, user balance history, order history and trade history. 

 

<Modules> 

・Match Server:  

 It records user balance and order in memory  database. It also writes user 
history into MySQL, push balance, orders and deals message to kafka. 

・Market Server:  

 Reads message from kafka, and generates k line data. 

・Data Server:  

 Recover history data from MySQL.

3.3 Features of EtherFlyer Platform 

3.3.1 Decentralized  

EtherFlyer consists of many contracts running on Ethereum. These contracts 

interact with each other to allow users to make trades. In order to use the 

exchange, users enter trade information and send funds to a master 

contract. Once this master contract receives both sides of the trade, it 

executes and sends the funds to the respective parties involved. A key 

distinction between EtherFlyer decentralized exchange and traditional 

centralized exchanges is where the funds are held during a trade. In the 

latter case, users are forced to trust the exchange's owners to execute the 

trade in a fair and secure fashion. In the case of EtherFlyer, the contract - 

not the exchange - holds the funds. This contract takes the form of auditable 

code which lives on the Ethereum network. Traders will no longer have to 

trust private servers to hold the order book, along with every single one of 

its inputs and outputs. This new order book and the deterministic nature of 

contracts on Ethereum brings much-needed transparency to cryptocurrency 

exchanges. 

 

3.3.2 High Speed Ordering and Matching 

EtherFlyer is built by means of a number of technologies based on the latest 

software development requirements. With a combination of the best 

frameworks at hand, EtherFlyer is aligned with the most recent technology 

standards. The trading system has adopted the hardware-accelerated and 

highly-efficient memory matching technology whose order-making peak 

value is 2 million+/second, order-processing peak value 1 million+/second. 

These statistics are hundreds times, even thousands of times of the normal 

industry standard. Therefore it can guarantee no delay or lag throughout 

the whole core order process when the market booms. 

 

3.3.3 Cross-Chain Trading 

EtherFlyer platform for ERC-20-compliant tokens can be directly graded 

online, and for non-ERC-20 compliant tokens, such as bitcoin, LiteCoin, 

Zcash, etc., the platform will continue to follow the development and 

gradually adopt different types of digital currency for cross-chain 

transactions . With the development of Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos, 

the Bitcoin deployment of Rootstock, and the relay technologies developed 

by other teams, such as BTCRelay, ZECRelay, X-Relay and others, EtherFlyer 

will use smart contracts to enable cross-link transactions.

3.3.4 Platform Contributors Continue to Win 

All users holding TCASH will share 50% of the transaction fee on the 

platform. The handling fee will be paid in the form of ETH. The dividend will 

be distributed to a unified capital pool on a weekly basis. Users can 

withdraw cash to the user-specified address . 

EtherFlyer also reward a discount on the trading fee to user who hold a 

certain amount of the TCASH token, the more holding amount results in 

higher trading fee discount. The amount of TCASH holding for trading fee 

discount are scheduled as:  

 

 

 

 

 

These overall schemes would improve user involvement and exchange 

vitality. The demand of the TCASH token would also carry out by the definite 

growth in terms of number of users and trading volume on the EtherFlyer 

exchange platform. The more in-demand and the higher the token liquidity 

will be. The value of the TCASH token will definitely be in very high position 

in long-term and near future. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.4 Assets that will be Traded Online 

3.4.1 ERC-20 Tokens  

Any token that conforms to the ERC-20 can be operated online by anyone 

directly on the web. Officials at EtherFlyer also submit online transactions 

for mainstream tokens with transaction value every month. When the 

platform is open for trading, we will first launch the following trading 

varieties: 

 

 

TCASH Holding Amounts Trading Fee 

Standard Trading Fee 0.30% 

200,001~600,000 0.20% 

600,001~1,000,000 0.10% 

1,000,000+ FREE

3.4.2 Bitcoins and other non-ERC-20 tokens  

The EtherFlyer platform will be systematically developed to expand cross-

chain transactions with other major non-ERC-20 virtual currencies, see 

official announcement for the exact timeline. 

3.4.3 EOS and EOS-based Tokens  

In 2018, EOS platform comes online, any tokens running on EOS platform 

will be support to trade in EtherFlyer. 

 

3.4.4 Fiat 

Although most countries have not yet put in place laws on digital currency 

and legal currency transactions, in order to avoid unnecessary legal risks, 

the EtherFlyer platform does not currently open the trading pairs of legal 

and digital currencies of all countries. In the future, if countries issue 

relevant legal and legal currency Direct trading, EtherFlyer platform will also 

open related functions.

3.4.5 Other Assets 

The EtherFlyer platform will also develop, in a later phase, the relevant 

transaction pairs for various assets such as futures, spot and the like, 

requiring a real-world acceptable acceptor who may be represented by any 

individual or institution that makes an application and satisfies the relevant 

requirements. 

 

3.5 Assets Online Management 

EtherFlyer ERC-20 symbol corresponding to the symbol, free online trading. 

For non-symbol ERC-20 tokens, can be put on-line application, wait for 

technical personnel to solve the technical problems, you can online 

transactions. Some centralized exchanges are linked to the interests of 

insiders as a result of the assets being shelved. As a result, the exchange 

only holds trading currencies that maximize its own profits. Many digital 

assets with real real value and technological innovation can not be traded 

online. Compared to these exchanges, EtherFlyer asset transactions more 

convenient, only the technical conditions permit, will not cause the user's 

asset safety risk, that is, online trading. EtherFlyer assets are publicly 

available online and are subject to oversight by all TCASH stakeholders. 

 

3.6 Profit Model 

The TCASH token is a revenue-generating cryptocurrency, that enables 

TCASH holders to receive revenues sharing from 50% of the total 

transaction fees charged by the EtherFlyer exchange platform for 

cryptocurrency transactions. Please note that this revenue sharing 

proportion could be adjusted based on the actual situation in the future. 

The revenues are transferred to the TCASH token holders' wallets on a 

monthly basis. The interest is generated by the transaction fee when 

transactions in cryptocurrencies supported by EtherFlyer are carried out on 

the exchange. Holding more than 1(one) TCASH are eligible for the revenues 

split and must register Ethereum address with EtherFlyer for distribution.

EtherFlyer.com is a 100% self-funded project that did not rely on any 

external investments prior to and upon its launch. The new and very 

expansive curve of its development implies launching a token native to the 

platform that will provide contribution opportunities to people who share 

the EtherFlyer.com vision and believe in the project's potential. The name of 

the token is TCASH, which is a standard ERC-20 crypto token with total 

issuance volume of 88,000,000 only and supports all Ethereum wallets.

maximum number of token is 52.8 million, which accounted for 60% of the 

total issuance. 

Private Sale Phase: Starting on December 2, 2017, for 8 days, ending on 

December 9, the total amount would be 10,560,000, representing 20% of the 

total sales tokens, and one ether can be exchanged for 2,600 TCASH. 

Pre-ICO Phase: Starting on December 10, 2017, for 3  days and ends on 

December 12. The total amount of pre-ICO token is 15,840,000, counted for 

30% of the total sales tokens and one  ether can be exchanged for 2,300 

TCASH.

will be available in the future. Pre-ICO and ICO participants need to 

complete KYC registration in the official website to ensure that all 

participants are qualified.  

 

The purpose of the KYC whitelist is to prevent activities such as terrorism 

financing, money laundering and financial fraud, and our team can better 

understand the first phase of TCASH tokens and carefully manage the risks. 

We will use the KYC standards common to global banks and financial 

institutions for review. The review included screening of international 

sanctions / terrorist lists, politically sensitive individuals and persons with 

negative news, risk assessment using proprietary software, and determining 

participants' inclusion.

Annex: API Introduction 
The EtherFlyer APIs are designed to allow access to the features of the EtherFlyer 

platform. The end goal is to allow people to potentially recreate the entire platform 

on their own. APIs are separated into two categories: trading and Market. Trading 

APIs require authentication and provide access to placing orders and other account 

information. Market APIs provide market data and are public. Please note the exact 

logic and API may change over time to further improve reliability. 

 

API Invocation Instruction 

1. All requests based on the Https protocol should set the request header 

information Content-Type as:'application/json’. 

2. All input and output data are in JSON format. 

3. Visit Root URL ： https://api.etherflyer.com 

4. Signature is required for trading API related interfaces. The signature data is 

placed in the authorization header of the HTTP header, and authorization is 

the signature result string. No signature is required for market API related 

interfaces.
