1 .  S U M M A R Y  
  
 Betrium is the solution developed by group of 

entrepreneurs and MIT & MIPT graduates offering the first partly 
decentralized worldwide betting service (betting exchange & 

sportsbook) with zero-commissions accepting crypto-currencies 
and offering platform for event organizers, developers and third-

party service providers. 
 
 As 2017, the global regulated gambling market is about 

$533b. The betting market accounted for $70b in global gross 

yield. The unregulated sector is many times larger.  

 

Today’s online betting services have a several disadvantages:  

— They’re not worldwide and allow withdrawals in limited 

countries only. 

— Most of betting services does not accept crypto-

currencies at all. 



	 5	

— They take high commissions. 

— Some of betting services automatically take taxes on 

personal income. 

— Makes profit for beneficiaries only. 

Some of the today's decentralized solutions have the following 

problems: 

 — Slow bets processing. Any solution powered just by 

Ethereum blockchain simply can’t provide the speed required for 

professional betting/trading on sports. 

 — Crypto-currencies volatility. 

 

The solution is Betrium. 

— Betrium accept crypto-currencies from all around the 

world. 

— We can process bets fast on our decentralized platform. 

— We stabilize crypto-currencies volatility. 

— We offer the lowest commission and the most profitable 

odds possible. 

— We optimize our customers’ taxes and fees. 

— We provide platform for event organizers (such as e-

sports streamers, sport leagues etc.), so they create own 

matches/games on a blockchain and can earn money. 

— Finally, Betrium is 20% more profitable for customers 

than any other service. 

 

Moreover, we are the first to offer a powerful betting API for 

developers, third party apps and betting bots. In future, Betrium 

may become a worldwide betting processing center providing its 

core to the huge number of services. 

 

So, to make the world’s largest betting service, Betrium is doing 

an initial coin offering and issuing its tokens on a public 

blockchain. Betrium is a project, where a real business meets 

new-generation technologies.

2 .  I N T R O D U C T I O N  
 As a part of an IT outsourcing firm, our Team once had a 

project related to sports betting services (odds analysis and 

betting automation). During the process of development, we 

faced the three obvious problems: in most cases, bookmakers' 

commissions and fees are absolutely unfair; they accept only 

national currencies (USD, EUR, RUB) and allows money 

withdrawing in limited countries only; the betting providers are 

completely unfriendly to developers and bots. 

We made some research of the betting and gambling markets 

and bookmakers' business model. After months of analysis, our 

Team came to the conclusion of building own advanced and fair 

service based on powerful blockchain technology.  

In Betrium bets happen off-chain and only added when the event 

happens and the outcome is undeniable. However the bets are 

broadcasted all over the network instantly for the odds to be 

recalculated. That means, in contrast to competitors, we are 

able to provide high-speed betting service built on 
decentralized IT architecture. 

In project financing, called "Initial Coin Offering" (ICO) has 

caused a breakthrough. That has contributed to the development 

of a new economy, which in its turn has opened up opportunities 

unimaginable in any traditional economic system. The 

phenomenon is ICO got world's resonance because of its ability 

to provide access to the global investment market for fast and 

safe project fundraising.  

The main difference between Betrium and other projects is the 

business model that actually makes money for founders, 

investors and customers. So Betrium is launching ICO to raise 

funding and to make the world's most advanced gambling 

platform.

Due the widespread fraud and scam in ICO, the management of 

Betrium is the first to offer real guarantees as an option for 

investors. 

 

Moreover, the Team is open for private investments. The Betrium 

is developing the new generation online service and looking for 

companions in this journey. Together, we'll make a future of 

gambling.

 The following is a summary of gambling and betting 

markets. The summary is taken from publicly available sources 

on the Internet. The main sources are: Global Betting and 
Gaming Consultants (GBGC), Technavio, Morss Analysis, 
European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), Firstgaming. 

 
4 . 1  K E Y - F A C T S  
 

The global licensed and regulated gambling is $533 billion. 

 

Interpol estimates that the unregulated Asia betting market 

alone is worth round $500 billion per annum with the 

worldwide unregulated market at upwards of $1 trillion. 

 

Global lottery sector has continued to show steady growth 

in otherwise difficult economic circumstances. 

 

Europe had the largest betting global gross yield with 41% 

of global market share, just ahead of Asia with 39%. 

 

For the British remote betting market, overall turnover 

(excluding betting exchanges) has increased considerably 

from £10.3 billion in 2008/9 to £19.6 billion in 2012/13, a 

rise of 90%. 

 

Mobile gambling is the fastest growing gambling segment. 

In 2015 share of mobile in total annual revenue reached 

from 24.5% to 29.4%. Revenue of mobile gambling in 2016 

is 26% higher than in 2014.

4 . 2  O V E R A L L  D A T A  
 
 The global licensed and regulated gambling market (all 

products including: betting, poker, casino, bingo, gaming 

machines and lotteries) is forecast to reach $533 billion in 2017. 

That would represent a 47% increase from the $363 billion 

market figure a decade earlier in 2007. Global Betting and Gaming 
Consultants (GBGC) and Morss Analysis 
 

Betting accounted for nearly 14% of $430 billion in total global 

gross gambling yield in 2012, with the latter forecast to reach 

over $470 billion in 2014. Betting similarly accounted for 14% of 

the $337.1 billion global market in 2007; the latter has grown by 

27.5% to reach the 2012 figure. European Gaming and Betting 
Association 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 



	 	10	

 
 

Europe had the largest betting GGY* with 41% of global market 

share, just ahead of Asia with 39%. Japan had the largest national 

betting market – twice the size of the UK in second place – as a 

result of betting permitted on horse racing, cycling, motorbike 

and boat racing. Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) 
 
Global online gambling equated to $40 billion in GGY in 2013 (up 

4.4% from $38.32 billion in 2012) and is forecast to reach $50 

billion in 2017. Online sports betting accounted for nearly 50% of 

the overall global online gambling market figure for 2013, 

equating to around $19.3 billion. 

 

The European interactive gambling market’s GGY was estimated 

to be worth €10 billion in 2012 (up 23.5% from €8.1 billion in 

2010) and is forecast to rise by 15% to €11.5 billion in 2014. 

 

* GGY — Global Gross Yield. 



	 11	

Some European countries do not currently have regulated online 

gambling regimes in place and also restrict retail and/or online 

betting to monopoly operations and national markets. 

 

Average mobile gambling spend per adult in the European Union 

(EU) is expected to grow from just over €1 in 2010 to over €17 by 

2018. Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) 
 
For the British remote betting market, overall turnover (excluding 

betting exchanges) has increased considerably from £10.3 billion 

in 2008/9 to £19.6 billion in 2012/13, a rise of 90%. 

 

It is also important to note national differences in the betting 

product split. In France, betting’s 30% share of the overall 

gambling market is broken down as 25.4% horse racing and 4.6% 

other sports. Whilst the UK, betting’s 39.1% market share is 10.7% 

racing and 28.4% other sports. 

 

The Italian online gambling market also shows betting as a 

significant product representing 23.9% of the overall national 

market’s gross gambling revenues (GGR) in 2012 and where 

horse racing accounts for only 1.6% of this figure as opposed to 

other sports betting at 22.3%. 

 

What can be stated is that INTERPOL, using data from its various 

operational activities, estimates that the unregulated Asia betting 

market alone is worth round $500 billion per annum with the 

worldwide unregulated market at upwards of $1 trillion. 

 

With the Chinese Sports Lottery having sales of nearly $18 billion 

in 2013, that would equate to an unregulated sports betting 

market of around $180 billion per annum in China alone. Whilst 

unregulated betting in India is estimated at around $60 billion 

annually, predominantly on cricket. 

 



	 	12	

Outside of Asia, the unregulated sports betting market in America 

(sports betting is only currently permitted in four states, but in 

practice is principally limited to Nevada) is believed to be 

somewhere in the region of $380 billion per annum; Nevada’s 

regulated betting is $3.45 billion. 

 

Whilst over $9 billion (C$10 billion) is wagered through 

unregulated bookmaking operations within Canada each year 

with another $3.5 billion (C$4 billion) through offshore online 

operators.

4 . 3  M O B I L E  G A M B L I N G  
 
 Mobile gambling is the fastest growing gambling segment. 
In 2015 share of mobile in total annual revenue reached from 

24.5% to 29.4%. Revenue of mobile gambling in 2016 is 26% 

higher than in 2014.  This growth is due the fact of overall mobile 

audience growth. Firstgaming 
  

According to TNS, in 2015 the number of desktop Internet users 

fell by 47.1% (from 60.5 to 32 million people). Significant part of 

users simply began to predominantly use the mobile Internet. 

 

All the leading betting services offers mobile applications for 

iOS/Android and actively encourage users to trasit to mobile 

platform.

4 . 4  C O N C L U S I O N  
  

 Gambling online market and particularly betting market is 

growing dynamically year after year. The share of online betting 

is growing.  

 

The regulated gambling market is $500B+, and the unregulated 

market much larger and is estimated to $1T. The betting is the 

major field of gambling sector. 

 

Also, there are some territories in the world, where online betting 

is disallowed.  

 

For the last few years, users actively transit to mobile devices and 

prefer using mobile applications. 

 

The betting has the following key-parameters: 

�Wealthy worldwide market; 
�Dynamically developing market; 
�Major unregulated share; 
�Actively growing mobile audience. 

 

Bringing all these factors together, it is understood that sports 

betting is one of the biggest and most perspective international 

markets on Earth. Online betting is the market, where 

decentralized crypto-based solutions are fully	substantiated. 
Moreover, the gambling, like all others sectors, is undergoing 

transformation due the new available technologies. 
  



	 15	

5 .  T H E  P R O B L E M S  
  
 The online betting industry has suffered from a luck of 

innovation for years. However, today's betting services have the 

following disadvantages: 

 

• No Worldwide;  
• No full worldwide work; 
• No worldwide money deposits and withdrawals; 
• No worldwide support; 
• Only local and most known sport events; 
• Many bookmakers ban foreign users; 

• High Commissions; 
• 1-3% fee on money deposit; 
• 1-3% fee on money withdrawals; 
• 0-5% fee on winnings; 

• No Crypto-Currencies Support; 
• Unfair Conditions — Due the legal issues, traditional 

bookmakers offer low-profitable odds. Moreover, they 
require a minimum deposit of $20+. 

• Taxes Issue — Some of betting services automatically 
take taxes on personal income; 

• No Vendor/Organizers Platform — there are no 
platforms giving possibility of creating own betting 
events. It may be useful for small sport leagues, event 

organizers, e-sport streamers. 

• No API — just few services provide public API for 
developers. Contrariwise, most of the betting providers 

block betting bots and third-party parsers.  

• Moreover, today's "decentralized" solutions can't 
provide fast betting service and has a problem of 

crypto-currencies' volatility. 



	 	16	

6 .  S O L U T I O N :  B E T R I U M  
  
 The solution of problems described above is the Betrium. 

Betrium is a decentralized service that is revolutionizing the 

nature of online betting and, in future, overall gambling.   
	
The blockchain technologies make Betrium open, resistant to 

hacking, and therefore a safe environment. Betrium is the first to 

offer the following key-features: 

• Worldwide;  
• Worldwide money deposits and withdrawals; 
• Worldwide support (for 25-30 countries); 
• All the sport events all around the world; 

• Volatility Stabilization —	balances will be fixed in the 
virtual USD/EUR, so users are protected from loosing in 
regular crypto currencies' dumps by integrating 
exchange functionality. 

• Event Organizers Platform — we offer a unique 
creation platform for event organizers. The platform 
gives opportunity to create events (and particularly 
cyber sport streams) and make profit on betting using a 

powerful blockchain technology. 

• High Commissions; 
• 0-1% fee on money deposits, withdrawals and 

winnings; 

• Support of Popular Crypto-Currencies; 
• ETH, BTC, LTC, XZC, DASH. 

• Taxes Issue — Betrium can't take taxes due it's nature; 
• Fast Bets Processing — Bets happen off-chain. 
• Open API — Betrium provides a public API for 

developers and encourages betting bots, third-party 
apps and betting service providers. 



	 17	

7.  O U R  V I S I O N  
 
The gambling industry is developing and moving towards. 

Gambling already takes a part in most people lives and the Market 

Review illustrates this. We do not respect traditional betting 

services due their unfair conditions and other problems 

described in "Problems" section. Our mission is to change that.  

 

Also, we think that every single event organizer like private 

Austrian box league should have an opportunity to earn money 

on bets. Betrium will give that opportunity to all, including 

individuals such as e-sports streamers.  

 

In Betrium bets happen off-chain and only added when the event 

happens and the outcome is undeniable. That means, in contrast 

to competitors, we are able to provide high-speed betting service 

built on decentralized IT architecture. Any solution powered just 

by Ethereum blockchain simply can't provide the speed required 

for professional betting/trading on sports.  

 

Finally, we will provide a powerful Public RESTful API, so 

developers may create as much betting bots as possible and 

build own betting services on their own using Betrium's core.

8 .  D E V E L O P I N G  
  
  Our Team has been developing the Betrium IT 

infrastructure since mid 2016. As of a day, it is 70% completed.  

 
8 . 1  I N V E S T M E N T S  
 
As of the day, Betrium began to develop in mid 2016 on 

founders' resources. In the spring of 2017 Betrium raised $0.22m 

seed investment from angel investor.  
 
8 . 2  C A P I T A L  
 
As illustrated in Financial section, every bookmaker service needs 

some capital on balance to pay win rewards on some stakes. 

Sometimes, the amount of users' win rewards far exceeds the 

amount of user's unsuccessful stakes. It that cases, bookmaker 

need some reserves to cover this shortage. 

 
Betrium will reserve ~10% of raised funds on this purposes. 
 
8 . 3  R E G U L A T I O N  
 
The licensing is required in two cases:  

• Money withdrawals (USD, EUR, AUD, GBP etc.); 
• Offline points. 

Depending on a country, the licensing cost varies from $0.1 to 

$2m annually. Licensing is required in many countries to support 

legal money withdrawals (means USD, EUR, GBP, AUD).  

 

Betrium plan to get license in Curaçao/Malta. Betrium due its 

nature does not need any license from any regulators. However, 

the licensing may be a possible continuation of Betrium's 

development. Betrium will start withdrawing USD & EUR. 



	 19	

8 . 4  T E C H N O L O G I E S  
 
At the very beginning of Betrium, our Team analyzed few ways of 

realizing of Betrium functionality. The important thing was 

worldwide availability and the risk of institutional processing. 

With the one voice, after a solid research, the Team decided to 

build Betrium on a blockchain technology. 

 

The Ethereum blockchain allows the creation of smart contracts 

that run business logic autonomously in the blockchain. The 

smart contracts enable secure and reliable processing of the 

events created and the transaction structure behind them. 

Payouts are processed automatically by the smart contract on 

the Ethereum blockchain. 

 

The blockchain gives opportunity to developers and third-party 

betting services providers to run their own solutions based on 

Betrium core. 

 

Moreover, all transactions are publicly verifiable, counterfeit 

resistant, and not subject to the risk of institutional processing. 

 
 

 
8 . 6  U I  D E S I G N  
 
What we really do not respect in our traditional competitors is 

design and UIX. Disgusting banners, a lot of absolutely 

unreadable text, dark colors,  

 

Betrium’s mission is to create a well-designed and user-friendly 

interface so it will be easy to place bets without any experience in 

betting.

platform and particularly volatility stabilization system. 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 .  S E R V I C E S  T O  B E  O F F E R E D  
  
The Betrium offers following services: 

•  Web-site for Online Betting on Sports (including e-sports); 
•  Organizers Platform (including web-service and desktop 

streaming software, promoting tools); 
•  24/7 International Support; 
•  Open API for Developers; 
•  Event Tracker; 



	 21	

•  Mobile Applications (iOS/Android). 
 
Each Betrium service has been described in this Whitepaper.  
 
By the process of Betrium developing and expansion, services 

may be changed and few will be added by the time (see "Future 

of Gambling" section). 

 

 
9 . 1  O R G A N I Z E R S  P L A T F O R M  
 
Betrium Organizers Platform is the unique creation platform 
for event organizers. The platform gives opportunity to 

create events and add to the Betrium betting platform (and 
particularly cyber sport streams). The event organizers 
receive 80% of net income earned from betting. 
 

The usage is simple: organizer opens a Betrium Organizer 
Account, creates a game (match, stream, fight, etc.), adds 
description, adds schedule and time of event, adds 
opponents and possible outcomes, setups some betting 

parameters and click a big "submit" button. That's it. 
 
In soon future, Betrium will provide a digital marketing 
platform for promoting such custom events.

 Betrium has several goals for future, which is described in 

following subsections. The main goal is to make the world’s 

biggest gambling platform. 

 

1 0 . 1  U L T I M A T E  O P E N  A P I  
 

Betrium API. One of the Betrium's key features is the powerful 
betting open API for developers, third party apps and a betting 

bots. In future, Betrium can become a world’s betting processing 

center, so other betting providers will be able to build Betrium-

based solutions. Event organizers will create custom betting 

services for their events using the modern API.    

  

1 0 . 2  E - S P O R T S  A R E A  
 
Betrium Cyber. Add e-sports area. In late 2018, we plan to run a 

section of Betrium Bets especially for cyber-sport. Cyber-sport is 

an actively developing market and e-games are absolutely 

important part of sport and youth culture even now.   

 

1 0 . 3  O N L I N E  L O T T E R I E S  
 
Betrium Lotteries. An important part of our expansion takes 
decentralized blockchain-based online lotteries. According to the 
Market Review, lotteries have a 10.3% share of overall gambling 
market and take the third place by its size. 
 
 

1 0 . 4  P O K E R ,  C A S I N O  E T C .  
 

Betrium Casino. We'll add more gambling play-fields such as 
online casino, online 



	 23	

poker and other games service. This is one of the major gambling 

markets after betting. 

 

In mid-late 2018, Betrium Team will release the first set of online 

games such as Bingo and Keno (2-3 games). Each game will be a 

separate project with own team and marketing. However, the 

projects will be a part of global Betrium Network so users will 

need one Betrium Network account only for all the games. 

 
1 0 . 5  L I V E  S P O R T S  
 

Betrium Live.  As a serious player on the market of sport events, 
Betrium's future goal is a live sports broadcasting. In mid 2019, 

Betrium is going to start live broadcasting of main sport events 

and e-sports streams in FullHD.  

 

The major part of the Betrium Live may take the e-sports 

streamings.  

 
1 0 . 6  O F F L I N E  
 

Betrium Offline. According to the market analysis below, the 
offline betting market still takes a serious share of global betting 

market. Potentially, the project may go partly offline in future. 

That means, that having enough financial power and stable 

position in the market, Betrium may start opening offline betting 

offices for customers, that prefer offline and cash-only. This 

requires licensing from local regulators and other bureaucratic 

constituents.    

 
1 0 . 7  R E G U L A T O R Y  
Licensing for bookmakers. Licensing is a logical continuation of 

betting service development. It is required in two cases: money 

withdrawals and offline points. The cost of license varies from 



	 	24	

$0.1 to $5m per year and depends on country. Also, regulators 

impose increased tax liabilities and social responsibility.

Bookmakers main source of income is the users' unsuccessful 

stakes. Simply, bookmaker adds a sport match, receives stakes 

and according to the public response and analysis predictions 

calculates the coefficient of betting odds in the way that any 

match outcome yields a profit for bookmaker (or the lowest loss 

in the unpredicted outcome). The high betting odds let people 

bet on low-possibility outcomes.

Team 1 vs Team 2. Predictions say Team 2 will be the champion.

= $0.12M 

 
 

 
   $1.4m 
+ $1.5m 
– $0.3m*10 
= –$0.1m 

 

 
    $1.4m 
+ $0.3m 
– $1.5m*1.05 
= $0.125m 

 

 
Thereby, according to the simplest probability theory, 

bookmaker's averaged profit from this single event may be: 

  

$0.12m * 0.3 + (-$0.1m) * 0.1 + $0.125m * 0.6 

= $0.101m

The real bookmakers' calculations are a bit more difficult and 

have a huge number of relations, but the main idea is the same.

 Betrium's revenue may consist of revenues of the following 

sources: 

1. Betrium service use fee at fixed price ($12–$120 per year, 
$1-10 per month); 

2. Advanced Accounts (+ 50-100% from the fixed Betrium 
service use fee); 

3. Event organizers platform fee (1-5% from stakes volume); 
4. Commission on winnings (0.01–1%); 
5. Money deposits (0.01-1%) on the Betrium Account Wallet; 
6. Money withdrawals (0.01-1%) from the Betrium Account 

Wallet; 

7. Bookmakers' main revenue source described below — 
users' unsuccessful stakes; 

8. Open API usage fee ($10-100 per year).

As a gambling platform, Betrium plans to expand its services (see 

the section "Future of Gambling") and become the global player 

on the market.  

 

The list of the possible sources of revenue in future: 

 

1. Online-casino (poker, black-jack etc.); 
2. Other games like Keno or Bingo; 
3. Decentralized online-lotteries; 
4. Betrium Live service for sports broadcasting;

The following data is Betrium Team's estimations, prognosis and 

goals about Betrium financial successes. 

 

The Betrium may be profitable from the first day of release. In the 

first year after the full launch the Team expects to make over $5 

million in revenue. In the future 3-4 years Betrium's goals are to 

increase the annual revenue to the $300-1200 million. 

 

The token capitalization goal is $2.5-12 billions. As our market is 

gambling, the goal is not as large as it sounds and is absolutely 

normal.

 There are a lot of reasons why we have chosen to do Initial 

Coin Offering instead of usual ways of raising money. The 

traditional IPO takes $1m and 9 months minimum; the advanced 

RTO takes $0.5m and 2 months minimum; as known, funds take 

too many times.

 The Betrium tokens (BTRM) are decentralized ERC20 
tokens based on Ethereum blockchain. A total of 140m BTRM will 
be emitted and no tokens will be issued after.

Betrium launches the following stages of Pre-ICO: 

1. Pre-ICO[1] (1-st stage); 
2. Pre-ICO[2] (2-nd stage). 

 
Pre-ICO[1] starts on 23 October, 2017, ends on 22 November. * 
Pre-ICO[2] starts on 22 January, 2018, ends on 14 February. * 
  

During both stages of pre-ICO tokens will be issued to prepare 

the initial version of Betrium in its best before the full ICO. 

Specifically: 

• MVP preparation; 

 
*Exact dates, duration and pricing on any stages of ICO may be changed in the 
interests of the company and will be presented on the official project's website 
https://betrium.co.  



	 	30	

• Solution of legal issues (gambling/ICO regulation); 
• Marketing campaign; 
• Attracting of advisors and sports representatives.  

 

Within the pre-ICO stage, Betrium puts up for sale 14 million 

tokens (10% of all tokens to be issued). 

 1 ETH = 6000 Betrium Tokens (BTRM)  on Pre-ICO [1] and 
5000 BTRM on Pre-ICO [2]. 

 Soft Cap: 320 ETH. 
 Hard Cap: 2330 ETH.

The Betrium's ICO starts on April, 05, 2018*, ends on May,14*, 
2018. 

 

63 000 000 (45%) Betrium tokens (BTRM) will be distributed 

during the ICO.The price of BTRM tokens will depend on the 

number of tokens issued during the ICO:

• Capital for Wins Rewards 10% 
• PR & Marketing 40% 
• IT Infrastructure Development and Support 22% 
• Legal Issues Fixing 4% 
• Localization for major languages 1%

 There will be a total of 140 million BTRM tokens in 
circulation, allocated in the following ways: 

 

• Up to 77 million sold to the general public during the 

token launch. 

• 28 million kept in the Betrium reserve pool for sale. 

• 7 million granted to advisors, sport representatives, e-

sports streamers, kept in a multisigned wallet. 

• 28 million granted to Betrium founders, management and 

employees. 

 

 

 

• Pre-ICO[1] participants will be allocated 3% of all tokens 

issued.       

• Pre-ICO[2] participants will be allocated 7% of all tokens 

issued. 

• ICO participants will be allocated 45% of all tokens issued. 

• SCO (secondary coin offering) participants will be allocated 

20% of all tokens.

1 2 . 6  T O K E N S  C R E A T I O N  
 

• No token creation will happen after the initial sale end.  
• The total supply of BTRM is fixed at 140 million tokens. 
• Tokens will be transferable and listed on exchanges once 

the initial sale is completed. 

 
1 2 . 7  P R O F I T  S H A R E  
 
50% of Betrium's profit will share between tokens holders. The 

rest 50% will be spent on platform developing and support. This 

means, that if a holder has a 1% of all issued Betrium tokens, he 

will receive 0.5% share of all net profit. 

 

Example. In the 2017 the investor contributed Betrium and 

bought tokens for $10 000. He actually received 0.02% share of 

the overall Betrium company. Later in 2020, Betrium has $200M 

in annual profit. The investor receives $20 000 as "dividends". 

 
The profit share is paid in ETH only to wallet addresses, which 

hold BTRM tokens. Payments to bank accounts are not planned. 
 
1 2 . 8  A D D I T I O N A L  B E N E F I T S  
 
 Participants of pre-ICO and ICO contributing more than 

1200.00 EUR (or more than ~2.00 ETH) will be eligible to receive 

an individual Betrium Premium Account, which gives unique 

possibilities: 

�Full access to the Closed Betrium BETAs. 
�Periodic invitations to thematic events dedicated to 

sports and e-sports. 

�Exclusive commission rates (0.01%) and the lowest 
service fees.

Blockchain projects are subject to supervision and control by 

various regulatory institutions (including governments) all around 

the world. Betrium tokens and services may fall under requests. 

However, blockchain technologies are decentralized, so the 

probability of such outcome is extremely small.

Betrium tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain platform. 

Any failure or malfunctioning of the Ethereum protocol may lead 

to the Betrium services not working as expected.

In case of unforeseen circumstances, the objectives stated in this 

document may be changed. Despite the fact that we intend to 

reach all the goals described in this document, all persons and 

parties involved in the purchase of Betrium tokens do so at their 

own risk.

Betrium is first and foremost an application created by sports and 

e-sports enthusiasts for sports and e-sports enthusiasts. In the 

last several months, our initial team has surrounded itself with 

professional sport analysts, gamers, streamers and various 

members of the e-sports community. Those conversations have 

led to constant adjustments and improvement of Betrium to 

converge toward an application that responds to the real needs 

of the community. We are always looking for new partners, so
