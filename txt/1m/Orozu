www.orozu.co/.com



www.orozu.co/.com



Most people who buy a house or a car, or buy things on Amazon, never think about 
“paying”  with cryptocurrency. Most people have no idea how many cryptocurrencies 
there are (over  1,000), though a lot of people have heard something about Bitcoin.

Very few people realize that cryptocurrency is simultaneously a currency, an invest-
ment and a  technology: you can buy a house with cryptocurrency, speculate with 
some of your retirement  money in cryptocurrency (and eventually invest in crypto-
currency ETFs), and invest in  cryptocurrency’s underlying technology (blockchain).

Not surprisingly, banks are smarter than politicians about cryptocurrency, and many 
individuals  and start-ups are smarter than banks. The rise of cryptocurrency is rough-
ly analogous to the  rise of medical and recreational marijuana. How long will it take 
“o�cial institutions” – banks,  corporations and the government – to discover crypto-
currency opportunities – and threats?  Their discovery journey is already well under-
way.

1. ABSTRACT

www.orozu.co/.com



We will market the ICO on the leading cryptocurrency exchanges and sites. 

We have an attractive referral program to increase adoption of Orozu. 

Our professional team is committed to meet the goals and targets outlined in our 
roadmap.

We will make all possible e�orts to increase the value of Orozu in future and to ensure 
that Orozu is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world within a year or two of 
our ICO.

1.2 Goals

Orozu will be created as a coin for transacting, money transfers and lending to people 
in a peer-to-peer network. You can trade, mine, stake and lend with Orozu. 

Orozu is a new revolutionary cryptocurrency which will change the �nancial world.  
The main attraction of Orozu will be the lending platform where we will be able to 
pay UP TO 30% a month (* Returns are not guaranteed, projections are based on our 
previous trading results) as a return/interest trading against the volatility in the cryp-
tocurrency market. Interest/return will be paid daily if trading results yield pro�ts.

The website will come with an internal exchange. It will have the latest security fea-
tures with best UX and ultra fast processing capabilities.

1.1 Vision

www.orozu.co/.com



The �nancial industry has many de�ciencies. There is a lot of discrimination in the 
�nancial world. Interests of the community , common investors and customers have 
been ignored for centuries.

The adoption of Blockchain Technology in the mainstream �nancial industry is very 
low. Big banks are trying to adopt Blockchain technologies but they are moving at a 
very slow pace.

Financial services requirements are huge eg. $120 trillion of client assets managed by 
global wealth managers earning $200 billion annually.

Banks and �nancial �rms have many issues with the current functioning such as slow 
speed of transactions, complicated lending procedures, etc.
 
Cryptocurrency market is a growing rapidly but it is still di�cult for individuals to 
understand risks on where and how they could invest e�ciently and securely. 

There are some cases of fraud and theft of cryptocurrencies in the past.

Traditional banking is losing its share in the market. Crowdfunding and ICOs are rais-
ing more and more capital on rapid pace.

The market in case of cryptocurrencies has seen a phenomenal and exponential 
growth. Many cryptocurrencies have come up from various parts of the world. 

 

2.1 General Overview

Banks are slow, take a lot of time in money transfer, and charge hefty fees, etc.

Some of the banks and �nancial �rms are having complex procedures. This leads to a 
lot of problems for the common customers who have to spend a lot of time and e�ort 
in ful�lling their requirements such as lengthy and cumbersome identi�cation proce-
dures, etc.

The dominating cryptocurrencies are having certain problems e. g. the very early 
investors are in a privileged position and new crypto investors are in a disadvantaged 
position. So, the common and new investors are not able to reap bene�ts of the new 
digital currency revolution.

Older dominating cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have challenges ahead as they are 
not as �exible as new coins with newer technology.

Bitcoin major problem is in bitcoin con�rmation network . The processing rate of 
every transaction is very slow, there is a big back log of the uncon�rm transaction.

The electricity that the miners are consuming based on POW are humongous as news 
report states that it’s consumption can eclipse a country’s usage. 

3. PROBLEMS

www.orozu.co/.com



4. KEY TECHNOLOGIES 

Proof-of-stake
The �rst crypto currencies based on the Proof-of-stake algorithm, or POS, appeared in 
2012 with Peercoin, followed by Emercoin in 2013, and NXT and BlackCoin in 2014. 
The primary objective of the cryptocurrency blockchain algorithm is to achieve the 
distributed consensus within the network that is secured by a signi�cant number of 
nodes.

POS algorithm designed as a more eco-friendly, resource e�cient, and reliable alter-
native to crypto currencies based on the Proof-of-work algorithm, or POW, that 
require massive amounts of energy to maintain the proper functioning and growth of 
the network.

Coins of POS-based crypto currencies are created through staking. In other words, all 
nodes in the network that possess any amount of coins in their wallet and keep the 
node online are automatically included in the coin forging pool and are therefore are 
eligible to create and sign blocks, securing the distributed consensus.

In May 2017 the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, announced that it 
would make a transition to a Proof-of-stake algorithm by the end of 2017.

POW and DPOS Comparison
As mentioned above, the only thing that nodes within a POS cryptocurrency need to 
do to is to maintain the security of the network itself. Therefore one needs to have a 
certain amount of coins in the wallet and keep the wallet online to be eligible to earn. 
This mechanism eliminates the human factor in the mining/forging process and 
helps to avoid spending massive amounts of electricity on creating coins. It is the 
backbone and the most laconic property of the Proof-of-stake algorithm.

www.orozu.co/.com



Apart from the Proof-of-Stake, two other algorithms exist in the cryptocurrency 

which are both meant to help blockchain reach a distributed consensus and maintain 
the integrity of the network.

Distributed consensus, is a term widely used in computer science and crypto curren-
cies. It should be interpreted as a mutual consensus among the majority of its users, 
on whether the data about the transaction in the last block is valid. If this is the case, 
the distributed consensus is achieved, and the block will be successfully signed, 
ensuring proper functioning of the network.

If the data in the last block is false, then distributed consensus among active mem-
bers of the network will not be reached, and therefore this block will not be signed, 
avoiding the possibility of various kinds of attacks that jeopardize the system integri-
ty or allows for double spending.

In cryptocurrencies that use POW the distributed consensus in the network is 
reached with the help of its active members, or miners, who need to use real comput-
ing produced by hardware to hash blocks and mine coins. Though this may seem like 
the most robust and true-to-life method of reaching the distributed consensus, actu-
ally it leads to several serious problems:

1. It requires massive amounts of energy due to the increasing di�culty to  mine 
coins.
2. Miners are required to purchase expensive equipment to survive in the 
ever-growng mining market. The hardware gets outdated fast and eventually ends 
up at a land�ll site, harming the environment even more.
3.  Such system leads to the appearance of miner monopolies that tend to negatively 
in�uence the commission fees and transaction processing times and also leaves the 
possibility of carrying out a 51% attack.

www.orozu.co/.com

world.  The  Proof-of-Work  (POW)  and  Delegated  Proof-of-Stake  (DPOS)  algorithms,  



Delegated Proof-of-stake, or DPOS, is the latest blockchain algorithm which is cur-
rently used by cryptocurrencies like BitShares. In its essence, it’s very similar to POS, 
but it still has quite a few changes that make it di�erent from the Proof-of-stake algo-
rithm.

Network nodes in DPOS cryptocurrencies create coins in the same way as it is in the 
POS-based ones - by storing the currency in the wallet. However, all necessary deci-
sions within the network in DPOS cryptocurrencies are performed via the results of 
elections organized by the members of the network.
At �rst sight, this mechanism may look more democratic and transparent, but it also 
makes the system complicated, potentially less secure due to the human factor 
involved, and decreases the user participation rate, in this way causing centralization 
concerns.

Cryptocurrency Volatility 
While cryptocurrencies have seen a signi�cant increase in value in recent years, the 
cryptocurrency market has also experienced material volatility. Moreover, with gov-
ernments around the world beginning to focus on cryptocurrencies, volatility could 
be ampli�ed as market participants react to the possibility of increased regulation. 
However, such e�ects are di�cult to predict, and cryptocurrency holders are there-
fore advised to diversify their holdings. For example, asset-backed tokens represent a 
promising source of diversi�cation since token values are backed by real-world 
assets.
