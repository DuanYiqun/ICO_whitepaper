IQeon is a decentralized gaming PvP platform, which allows players to earn real money on their
achievements.

IQeon represents an infrastructure that will allow the integration of games, applications and
services based on intelligent competitions between users, as well as applications and services for
motivation.

The name “IQeon” is not chosen by chance and is a combination of two concepts. Part of the
name “IQ” implies a common abbreviation of the term “intelligence quotient”. Part of the name
"Eon" is a concept from ancient Greek philosophy, meaning epoch, eternity, generation. These two
concepts reflect the worldview of the project, which, in the modern era of innovation, actually has
human intelligence as a driver that guides the progress of humankind.

IQeon is the first platform where players can earn money thanks to their intelligence and
achievements. This will be realized by using the internal currency in the IQeon ecosystem, which
at any time can be converted to the crypto currency – IQeon tokens (IQN) issued based on
Ethereum blockchain. IQeon tokens (IQN) can be freely exchanged at existing cryptocurrency
exchanges, or to fiat money .

Purposes of the project:

Introduction

further development of IQeon platform;

creation of IQeon ecosystem;

formation of the audience of engaged platform applications and games users;

formation of partnerships with game developers and game content for the platform;

development of a line of IQ Clash proper games based on the platform.

1.1. Mobile games and applications global market

Rapid growth in the number of mobile devices inevitably leads to increase in
the number of mobile applications and games users. According to the
Newzoo 2017 Global Mobile Market Report , as at the beginning of 2017, the
number of smartphone users exceeds 2.3 billion, or 31% of the world's total
population. By 2020, this figure will reach 3.6 billion.

Mobile games market is the largest segment of the global gaming market and by the beginning of
2017, it amounted to 42% ($ 45.7 billion) and by 2020, the share of mobile applications and games
will grow to 50% and in monetary terms will amount to $ 62.3 billion.

1. Growth of the game industry

1.2. Features of mobile intelligent games
market

According to SurveyMonkey Intelligence Survey  in the field of mobile
games and applications, intelligent games and puzzle games (the
genre of “puzzles”) are ranked 3rd for the number of downloads
among other game genres, with almost two times lower indicator than
that of arcade and action game genres:

The concept of platform games also includes such genres as “casual”, “card”, “casino”,
“educational” and “dice”. In the whole, these genres account for 23% of the total number of mobile
games downloads.

However, the number of downloads is not a determining indicator when monetizing applications.
Much more important is the number of active users (we consider the parameter monthly active
users (MAU) – the number of users who use applications at least once a month) and the
engagement of users (the amount of time spent in the game).

[2]

5



By the number of active users, puzzle games also occupy the third place, this time closely
approaching the first two places (arcade and adventure):

The cumulative amount of active users by genres that are attractive for the platform is 30% of the
total number of active users.

By the amount of time spent in the game, puzzle games take �rst place; each active user
spends an average of more than 1 hour per month playing puzzle games:

6



However, in terms of monetization, puzzle games move to the �fth place:

This trend is explained by the specifics of puzzle games, most of all users use them to “fill” time
(on a trip, in a queue, during a break, etc.), i.e. users are ready to spend time playing these games,
but are not ready to make purchases in them.

According to the Mediakix resource, puzzle games are installed on 58% of smartphones and
tablets.

The above statistics indicates a high potential for monetization of this genre of games. The
opportunity not only to spend time, but also to earn money, playing puzzle games, will attract to
IQeon ecosystem games additional payable audience of gamers.

7



2.1. Solutions, with the help of which you can, playing intellectual games, get as a win real
money are not widely used on the market.

So far, 97% of gamers do not have the ability to monetize their achievements in the gameplay. The
remaining 3% attempt monetization in the following ways:

The remaining 57% of attempts to monetize cannot succeed because of account blocking by
developers or fraud, which leads to the loss of all virtual achievements.

IQeon solves this problem by using IQeon game currency. Earned IQeon when transferred to the
user's personal account of the platform is exchanged for IQeon tokens, which can then be freely
purchased and sold at the cryptocurrency exchanges.

2.2. The market practically does not have any solutions that allow organizing PvP
competitions with �xing conditions and automatic payment of gain to the winner.

Game scenarios of IQeon platform applications allow players to enter into a dispute between
themselves by placing a bet in IQeon on a certain achievement or event. The system will
automatically pay the gain to the winner.

2. The problems of mobile
intelligent games market

specialized services and auctions (20%);

thematic forums (12%);

direct agreements between players (8%);

illegal exchanges (3%);

8



2.3. The authors of content for intelligent games do not have the ability to monetize their
groundworks without serious investments in the development of technology solutions, for
example, mobile applications.

An application designer based on the IQeon SDK platform will be implemented. With its help, game
content developers will be able to create new applications based on existing scenarios and game
mechanics with minimal e�ort.

2.4. Receiving payments in mobile games and applications through the App Store and
Google Play is associated with large commissions (30%).

The total commission for exchanging IQeon tokens (IQN) in available currency will not exceed 10%.

2.5. The developers receive one-time earning for in-game purchases.

IQeon platform allows the developer to earn money from each bet. The platform uses the
following system of charges and rewards: players who want to make a bet or “fight” in one of the
games, place equal bets (for example, 500 IQeon). The amount of bets makes 1000 IQeon, 88% of
which comprises a prize fund, that the winner will receive, and 12% (120 IQeon) is the platform's
fee. 50% of the platform’s fee is paid to the developer as a reward.

2.6. Bonuses and game points received in one game cannot be used in other games.

IQeon platform solves this problem by the possibility of exchanging the local currency for IQeon
(IQN) tokens. Through the platform user's private account, the internal currency on the balance of
any game or platform application can be converted to IQeon (IQN) tokens and vice versa.

9



3.1. Purposes of the platform

IQeon team develops a flexible and scalable platform for the rapid launch of new products that
allow players to compete among themselves in a variety of intelligent and logical tasks, receiving
IQeon internal currency for the best result.

Another direction for the development of IQeon platform is motivational applications. This
direction is especially important in the field of education, sports, and the observance of a healthy
lifestyle. Often people do not have enough inner motivation to study certain material, or force
themselves to run in the morning, or lose several kilograms.

3.2. Technical advantages

The blockchain technology guarantees reliability and anonymity of all payment transactions in
IQeon system, and IQeon (IQN) token itself corresponds to the ERC20 standard, which makes it
compatible with existing wallets and stock exchange crypto-currencies, and allows its easy
integration into a variety of products and solutions.

Fully supported by Ethereum block chain, mechanism of smart contracts, on the basis of which
IQeon token is issued, will provide permanence and reliability of the conditions of each
competition (bet), as well as a guarantee of winning.

3.3. Advantages of the platform for developers of
games/content

3. Advantages 
of IQeon platform

A ready developed infrastructure for the introduction of payments based on the
cryptocurrency into its own products.

The use of IQeon tokens is consistent with the App Store Review Guidelines and the
Google Play Developer Policy.

Reduction of charges for developer fees withdrawal (from 30% Google Play and Apple
Store to 10%).

Additional game audience for your own products.

API that allows quick integration of your products into an existing ecosystem.

SDK for rapid deployment of new applications based on IQeon platform.

10



3.4. Advantages of the platform for players

3.5. Advantages of the platform for token buyers

Games and applications for self-development field shows rapid growth, and
IQeon platform is the first solution in this area that allows players to receive
income in the form of liquid crypto currency.

Developed partnership system, involvement of third party developers in
IQeon ecosystem and expansion of its own product line will lead to a growth
in the audience of users and increase in demand for IQeon token.

These facts should ensure the growth of the value of IQeon token, which can
be purchased at the lowest price during the Crowdsale period. After this, IQN
can be bought only in the open market.

Genericity. The internal currency IQeon, earned in one game,
can be used in another one.

Liquidity. Using your own platform wallet IQeon tokens could be
exchanged for avaliable currency .

Convertibility. Using multiple cryptocurrency exchanges,
IQeon tokens can be exchanged for any other crypto currency
(bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, etc.).

Reliability. Thanks to the blockchain technology, all
transactions of IQeon tokens in the ecosystem are of no return;
they are repeatedly recorded in the decentralized transaction
register, and thus are protected from forgery and any types of
fraud. The use of smart contracts ensures that the terms and
conditions of each dispute are recorded and invariable and
guarantees payment of the winnings.

Anonymity. IQeon platform allows players to remain
anonymous.

11



IQeon platform focuses on the range of applications for self-development,
logical games and PvP disputes. Below are the developed scenarios for
applications that will be implemented in the platform. This list will be
constantly supplemented in the process of platform development:

4.1. Scenario for motivation and self-development

This scenario assumes that two players bet on the fact that one of them (player A) will perform a
certain action (lose weight by X kilogram, go to college, hit a basketball in the basket 10-peat,
etc.). Each of them contributes the same amount, which will be paid, after deducting the platform
fee and developer's reward (total 12%), to player A if he performs the action, or to player B, if
player A would not perform the described action.

All transaction terms pass through IQeon API to the blockchain and cannot be changed. After
completing or not of what is described in the conditions of the action, both players must confirm
the corresponding result in the application. Payment of rewards is accomplished through the
mechanism of smart contracts.

For cases, if the players do not agree on the result of the dispute, the mechanism of remote
conflict resolvers is implemented in the application. Players can choose an arbitration option for
their dispute, and a remote conflict resolver will make a sound decision about the results of the
dispute according to the materials provided (picture, video). An additional charge for invocation of
a conflict resolver will be deducted from the prize fund.

Both friends and unfamiliar with each other players can participate in the scenario. The second
option will be implemented through the listings of achievements. The first listing will contain
requests from players “I'm ready to bet on XX IQN that I will do ...”, and each player can respond to
such a request. The second listing will contain the queries “I bet on XX IQN that no one can do ...”,
and again each player respond to this challenge.

4. Platform description

12



4.2. Scenario for PvP disputes

This scenario is similar to the previous one, however in such a scenario the dispute can be
concluded for any event (the result of a sports match, election results, the winner of the
Eurovision Song Contest, whether it will rain tomorrow, whether the morning train will arrive on
time, etc.) and between a group of players.

In addition, in this scenario, there may be di�erences in the mechanism for determining the
results. For many events, the result can be automatically loaded from the trusted resource API
and entered into the system by a smart contract. In this case, no confirmation of the outcome of
the dispute is required by all players. If the result cannot automated, the approach described in
the first scenario is applied. Arbitration is involved in disputable cases.

The mechanism for fixing the terms of the dispute and paying out winnings is also similar to the
first scenario.

4.3. Scenario for educational applications

This scenario is applied to already existing and new services and applications of aimed at
education (training courses, learning foreign languages, etc.).

In such applications, on-line training is paid. The course usually consists of theoretical
information, audio recordings, video clips, and interactive assignments, tests for intermediate and
final control.

For additional motivation of trainees, the following mechanism is applied: the user pays the cost
of the course in IQeon tokens and starts training. For high results in tests, as well as for certain
activities, the trainee receives a reward in IQeon internal currency, thereby returning a part of the
paid course cost. The application developer or the author of the course determines what part of
the cost (maximum) the learner can return in the form of rewards is determined.

13



4.4. Scenario for quest game with AR

The given scenario involves player’s passing of a sequence of levels for time. Each level
represents an intellectual puzzle for determining the location (park, public building, courtyard,
bridge), after arriving at which the player looks for a code placed with the help of AR or a hint that
will help the player to give an answer to the current level. After entering the answer in the
application, the player moves to the next level, gets the next puzzle, etc. The quest is announced
in advance and starts for all participants at the appointed time. The participant who has passed
all levels in a minimum of time wins. The prize fund is divided among the players who have taken
the first 3 places, commensurate with the occupied position and the di�erence in the time of
passing.

4.5. Advanced scenarios

The IQeon team plans to expand the list of game scenarios using modern technologies, such as AI
(Artificial Intelligence) and VR/AR (Virtual / Augmented Reality) after the launch of the platform.

AI based on neural networks will use a constantly improving self-learning algorithm for creation
and generation of logical tasks.

VR/AR will add the games with contests implemented in virtual reality to the IQeon platform.

14



5.1. Demo

Another scenario - the scenario of game rooms - has already been developed by the IQeon team
and implemented as an IQ Clash API, and the first application - "IQ Clash: Intelligent Battles" - can
now be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play:

5.2. Scenario for puzzles using game rooms

This scenario is based on the implementation of the game rooms in the application. The game
room is a sequence of logical tasks performed by the players during a certain time of the room
action. To participate in the competition, the player makes a contribution (bet). The amount of
bets, minus the platform charge and the developer's reward, forms a prize fund, which is then
distributed among the players who took the first places (who showed the best result when
passing the tasks).

5.2.1. Public Rooms

Public rooms are available to all users and are displayed in a list on the application main screen.
Two or more public rooms with similar set of parameters (the number of participants and the bet)
cannot be available at the same time.

Public rooms can be of two types:

5. IQ Clash API

Automatically created are 4 rooms created by the system are permanently in public
access (for 2, 6, 12 and 24 persons). The rooms are created automatically instead of filled
or expired.

5.2.2. Private rooms

Private rooms are created by user and are accessible only by a direct link. The user can share the
link in any convenient way (posting in social networks, sending a direct message, etc.). When
creating a private room, the user selects room capacity from the o�ered (2, 6, 12 and 24), a bet (it
cannot be more than the vendor’s account balance). When creating a private room, the user can
specify a publication setting. The room can only be private, or it can become published under
certain conditions specified by the user when creating it:

5.2.3. Gameplay

The gameplay begins when a user joins the game. It consists of a sequence of logical tasks from
di�erent categories, formed using AI).

Mechanics inside each category are chosen randomly. To complete all tasks, a user has 10
minutes, after which the game is forcibly completed and the user is given the result N/A, which
deprives him of the right to participate in general drawing. In this case, he does not receive the
bet back. If a user leaves the game process without completing all the tasks, he is given the result
N/A, which deprives him of the right to participate in general drawing. In this case, he does not
receive the bet back.

5.2.4. IQeon obtaining

IQeon internal currency can be earned in application in the following ways:

To use IQeon in the application, it is necessary to bind the wallet with IQeon to this application in
user account. A user can get the opportunity to win IQeon internal currency, without a need for
payment in the application. This opportunity gives a ticket to the game of the day on IQeon, which
a user can receive for the following activities in the application:

Published private rooms are private rooms, at creation of which the user indicated that it
should become public under certain conditions (time frame or content). These rooms also
obey one-time public access rule of only one room with a certain set of parameters. Other
rooms with the same parameters are bu�ed at the time of compliance with the publication
conditions and are published when there is no public room with the same parameters and
there is no room with the same parameters created earlier in front of it. Such rooms will
also be for 2, 6, 12 and 24 participants, but bets will be di�erent.

Time frame. The room remains private for a fixed period of time, after which it is bu�ed for
publication.

Completeness. The room remains private until a certain number of participants join it.

receive for a task completion.

enter the app during 7 consecutive days.

The IQeon platform provides a functional and convenient mechanism for
hosting e-sports tournaments. Classic tournament in e-sports is a major
event, the organization of which requires considerable resources. IQeon
makes organization of an online tournament available for any user of the
platform.

6.1. Matching Services and Games

Not only the games integrated into the IQeon platform, but also any games of a competitive
nature may become the games for the tournament. The main condition is the possibility to track
the results of matches through one of the supported APIs (Steam, Origin, Uplay, Battle.net, etc.).

6.2. Application of Smart Contracts

The important criteria when conducting online tournaments are transparency and guarantee of
compliance with all conditions of the tournament. To ensure these criteria, smart contracts and
independent resolvers will be involved in the IQeon platform.

6. Tournaments based on the
IQeon platform

17



6.3. Procedure for the conduct of the tournament

A player who wants to create a new tournament can do it through the IQeon web portal. When
creating a tournament, the name, the game, the dates, the amount of the participation fee, the
requirements for the participants, the game mode, the format of the tournament, the number of
participants and the way the prize fund is distributed are indicated.

Information about the tournament is published in a special section of the web portal, and all
interested players register to participate in the tournament. When registering, each participant
specifies his ID for tracking match results (for example, Steam ID), as well as the address of the
cryptocurrency wallet.

After registration of the required number of participants, the IQeon API forms a smart contract
with the necessary conditions for the tournament and publishes it in the Ethereum network. The
address of the smart contract for transferring contributions in IQN for participation in the
tournament becomes available in the personal accounts of the participants. 95% of the collected
amount of IQN forms a prize fund, 5% constitutes the commission of the platform from which
payments for the transactions in the Ethereum network and remuneration to the resolvers are
paid, and the rest is the reward of the platform.

After all the conditions necessary for starting the tournament are fulfilled, the stage of matches
begins; the results of each match are tracked through the platform API, to which the tournament
game is connected. After each match, the participants confirm their results in their personal
account. A resolver is involved in case of controversial situations (for example, the use of cheat
codes) or in case of technical problems, (the match is not completed due to the network
disconnection). The resolver may decide to make a second match or disqualify one of the players
for violating the rules of the tournament. After confirmation of the results by the players or the
decision of the resolver, the match results are recorded in the tournament's smart contract
through the IQeon API.

18



6.4. The order of formation and distribution of the prize fund

19



After receiving the results of all scheduled matches, the smart contract distributes IQN in
accordance with the scheme of the prize fund distribution chosen at the stage of the tournament
creation. The scheme above shows an example of the distribution of winnings.

When creating a tournament, you can select several brackets and several winnings distribution
schemes.

Not only the platform user, but also the sponsoring company may create the tournament. In this
case, the tournament participants do not pay the fees, and the organizing company sponsors the
prize fund.

20



IQeon API. Provides a set of methods and interfaces for the interaction of all platform elements.

IQeon blockchain control subsystem. Implements services on interaction with Ethereum
blockchain. It records transactions with use of IQN to blockchain, deployment and interaction
with smart contracts.

IQeon web application. It is a platform portal. It contains information part (platform description,
blog, documentation) and user and developer personal accounts.

Users can, through their personal account, link applications to their account, make purchases,
transfers, exchange IQN for available crypto-currencies and fiat money .

Developers can get API keys for their applications, register a new application in the platform, see
statistics for accrual of remuneration, and exchange IQN for available currencies through their
personal account.

In addition, the personal account service replicates IQeon wallet application to web services.

IQeon wallet. Is the application (iOS, Android), which allows the user to issue a debit card after
verification and exchange IQN for avaliable currency (and vice versa).

7. Platform architecture

21



IQeon SDK. Is a creation tool set for rapid expanding of new games and applications based on
existing scenarios and game mechanics.

IQ Clash API. Is a set of methods and interfaces for agile development and integration of games
and applications based on the scenario of game rooms into the platform.

Existing games & services. Existing games and applications thanks to API can be integrated
into IQeon platform. This will allow existing games to take full advantage of the platform and use
IQeon token in the gameplay.

Ethereum wallet & Digital currency exchangers. IQeon token complies with ERC20 standard.
This means that it is initially compatible with Ethereum wallet and can be freely transferred from
one address to another. In addition, this standard provides token’s genericity and technical
compatibility for further addition for crypto-exchange stocks trading and for exchange on online
crypto currency stock services.

Nowadays the legislation of most countries in the world to various extents toughen the
requirements for online services that allow earning money online. The team of IQeon project,
together with legal advisors, studied the legislation of the top countries for the project.

Experienced legal advisors helped IQeon project to create its own concept of mobile games,
applications and services that do not meet the criteria of activities subject to regulation and
licensing. Therefore, IQ Clash products and the products of the platform’s partners that support
transactions using IQeon (IQN) token will meet the requirements. The expectations of IQeon
platform users regarding the benefits of using our products and the ability to receive money will
be worthwhile.

IQeon platform focuses on the range of applications for self-development, logical games and PvP
disputes. The use of IQeon (IQN) token, which is not a means of payment, in analogy with the fiat
money, prevents the claims of authorities. The use of crypto currency in internal transactions in
such software products practically does not encounter resistance from the authorities. This is
possible thanks to the fact that the funds in fiat money will not be stored on the user account
balance in IQeon games and applications.

12.1. IQN - ERC20 standart token

IQeon is not just a platform, but also a whole ecosystem, including application and content
developers, platform partners and millions of users. The internal economics of the ecosystem
cannot exist without its own currency, the role of which will be performed by IQeon (IQN) token.

IQeon (IQN) token will be released on the basis of Ethereum platform and fully comply with
ERC20  standard. Support of this standard guarantees the compatibility of the token with third-
party services (wallets, exchanges, listings, etc.), and provides easy integration with these
services. Ethereum platform fully supports Dapps concept thanks to the integrated Solidity
language for writing smart contracts that will be used to implement a number of functions in
IQeon platform (payment transactions, fixing of disputes terms, paying out of winnings and
rewards).

The release of our own tokens is driven by the need to raise funds for further platform
development, as well as the need for internal economy of the ecosystem that, thanks to the
advantages of blockchain technology, will be based on transparent and trusted relations between
all participants, thereby enabling a more e�cient business model for using the platform.
