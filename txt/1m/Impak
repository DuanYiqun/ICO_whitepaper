1. Introduction 

The launch of a new cryptocurrency called impak Coin (MPK) is done in the context of the 
creation of impak.eco, an online social network 100% dedicated to the Impact Economy – a fast 
growing segment of the general economy where organizations and individuals share the belief 
that economic activity should consider more than just its financial aspects, but also take into 
account the effect it has on people and the planet. 

impak Finance Inc. is the entity designing and developing impak.eco. Its plans also include the 
creation of a new digital Canadian Bank 100% dedicated to the Impact Economy that would be 
placed at the centre of the ecosystem and act as an agent of economic growth within this space.  

At its core, this project proposes to radically change the way people experience their relationship 
with money by proposing a unique place where investors, companies and individuals exchange 
with each other with the understanding that each dollar has the purpose to do good. impak.eco 
shares features found on social networks and in disruptive fintech applications and aims to 
become that place one comes back to on a daily basis. With the focus being on the growth of the 
Impact Economy, every money transaction, whether it is banking, investing, selling or buying 
value-aligned responsible products & services, is done with the transparency one would expect in 
a changing world where the power of capital resides not only in the hands of the few, but also in 
the hands of the many. And where the power of capital serves values that make the world a 
better place. 

This new cryptocurrency, impak Coin, is unique because it is one of the only digital currencies 
with a social purpose. Traditionally, complementary currencies have been created to promote and 
sustain local economies, sometimes in the service of social and environmental values. impak 
Coin is their modern version, amped up because of its capacity to support locally-rooted initiatives 
and to marshal the forces of a global community of people that are willing to combine the power 
of capital and technology to change the world. impak Coin will harness that power and use it to 
sustain and grow the impak.eco social network, and consequently, the Impact Economy.

2. Executive Summary 

2.1 impak Finance 

impak Finance Inc. is a start-up on course to create a new, completely digital Canadian 
Schedule 1 Bank dedicated solely to the Impact Economy. At the centre of its value proposition is 
a plan to radically change the way people and companies do their banking by putting the Bank at 
the centre of a social network (impak.eco) that will connect Investors, Companies and Retail 
Customers. 

The choice of a Bank as the principal instrument of growth for the impact space is motivated by 
several factors: 

• The unique power to grow the money supply a bank possesses by virtue of fractional-
reserve banking. 

• The opportunity to create a financial institution that is truly centred on the real economy 
and its role as an agent of economic development, rather than focused on speculation 
on financial markets as a means to enhance its return to investors. 

• The disruption potential that fintech firms provide in the building of a banking experience 
that is in line with expectations and values of millennials and other like-minded strata of 
society. 

2.2 impak.eco 

The impak.eco social network will be launched at the end of 2017, prior to the Bank. impak.eco 
aims to bring structure to a very fragmented space: the Impact Economy – where even 
experienced investors have very poor visibility over companies that would represent sound 
investment opportunities because of: (i) a lack of intermediaries specialized in seeking out impact 
companies and qualifying them and (ii) the absence of a coherent and recognized way to 
measure the level of impact of these companies so that investors can make an informed decision.  

Likewise, entrepreneurs in the impact space looking for capital have very few options when it 
comes to finding value-aligned investors and have no platform dedicated to their space onto 
which they could put forth the qualities that make them interesting investment opportunities. 

One of the main objectives of the social network is to give a voice to every Citizen wishing to use 
her money as a force for good. Today, impact investment is mostly reserved to institutions and 
accredited investors. With impak.eco, Citizens will be able to identify impact merchants and have 
access to products and services aligned with their values. They will be able to actively participate 
in transforming the world every day by responsibly choosing which companies their money will 
support. 

The reunion of like-minded Investors, Businesses and Citizens in the ecosystem is the basis for a 
true, transactional social network dedicated to the Impact Economy. The abundance in the 
marketplace of sophisticated applications, whether from fintechs or other providers allows for the 
creation of a service offering that will result in a truly habit-forming experience. 

2.3 The impak Scorecard 

The impak Scorecard is the criteria by which all companies on the social network will be judged 
on their level of impact. Every merchant on impak.eco will have been pre-accredited by going

through an online filter system (impak Scorecard). As such it is the central element in how 
choices will be made both by investors looking at investment opportunities and retail customers 
looking for value aligned businesses to provide them with the products and services they seek. 

It is derived from the evaluation of a company’s performance in four areas: Governance, Well-
being of Employees and Community, Environment and Economic Sustainability. 

2.4 impak Coin 

impak Coin is the cryptocurrency impak Finance will issue. It is the first digital currency of its kind 
completely dedicated to the Impact Economy. impak Coin will possess features that make its use 
advantageous - alongside the national currency - within impak.eco, thus promoting the growth of 
this space.  

The impak Coin launch is based on the combination of three movements that gained worldwide 
momentum in the last decade: 

• Complementary currencies 

• Impact Economy 

• Cryptocurrencies (Blockchain) 

2.4.1 The power of complementary (local) currencies: 

• Complementary currencies (CCs) have been proposed as a means to stimulate local 
economies, reduce unemployment, and promote cooperative and sustainable community 
development. They aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy 

• They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals. 

• There has been an explosion in the number of CCs in existence in the last decade. There 
are now well over 5,000 such currencies worldwide.  

• The major factors identified as limiting the success of real CCs are the lack of major 
institutional buy-in and structural features about the currencies’ designs that limit their 
volume of transactions.1 

2.4.2 The Worldwide Growth of the Impact Economy  

Doing good while doing well. That is the mission of impact businesses and investors, who 
combine the desire to address a social problem with wealth creation. 

The Impact Economy is a new market force underpinned by companies, entrepreneurs and 
investors that have the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a 
financial return. Impact entrepreneurs are pursuing business opportunities that will both generate 
profit and address endemic social problems. 

The growing impact investment market provides capital to address the world’s most pressing 
challenges in sectors such as sustainable food and agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, 
microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and

education. With a rapidly expanding market and an increasing number of participants, the idea of 
“impact” as an economic force has hit the mainstream. 

According to Purpose Capital, a consultancy firm specialized in impact investment, Canadian 
investment in that space surpassed the $60 billion mark in 2015 and will reach over $500 billion in 
the next 10 years. 

Increasing amounts of capital are flowing into the Impact Economy. In 2012, the Calvert 
Foundation formed an estimate through a representative survey of investment managers, 
applying prospective adoption rates to a global investment management industry of 
US$ 26 trillion, and reached a market potential of US$ 650 billion.  

On April 17th 2017, the Ford Foundation committed to invest US$1 billion in the Impact Economy. 
According to the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an industry group that tracks market 
trends, impact investment has grown in size from US$15 billion two years ago to more than 
US$77 billion in 2016. 

 

2.4.3 The Decentralized Collaborative Power of Cryptocurrencies 

If you take away all the noise around cryptocurrency and reduce it to a simple definition, they are 
simply entries in a database that no one can change without fulfilling specific conditions. This 
may seem pedestrian, but, believe it or not: it is exactly how you can define currency. 
Take the money in your bank account: aren’t they just entries in a database that can only be 
changed under specific conditions? Take physical coins and notes. What are they, if not entries 
in a public physical database that can only be changed if you match the condition that you 
physically own the coins and notes? Money is all about a verified entry in some kind of database 
of accounts, balances, and transactions. 

In other words, the technology supporting Bitcoin – the mother of all cryptocurrencies - is a 
decentralized network of peers keeping a consensus about accounts and balances. Some say it 
is more of a currency than the numbers you see in your bank account - numbers that are no more 
than entries in a private database that are managed by people you don’t see and by rules you 
don’t know. 

Cryptocurrencies are entries about tokens (coins) in decentralized consensus-databases. They 
are called cryptocurrencies because the consensus-keeping process is secured by strong 
cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are built on cryptography. They are not secured by people or by 
trust, but by math/software. The probability of an asteroid falling on your house is higher than that 
of a bitcoin address being compromised. 

The three main issues cryptocurrencies solve are: 

1. National currency creation is based on debt creation. Most cryptocurrencies are rather 
created through value creation. 

2. Banks are the creators of national currency supplies. Cryptocurrencies are owned and 
controlled by the communities that use them. 

3. Most banks invest their liquidities based on no other value other than profit 
maximization. Cryptocurrencies are created to support specific projects.  In our case, 
impak Coin (MPK) supports a project with a clear societal and environmental purpose.  

2.5 Having the Courage to Change the World 

Innovation is scary. But this doesn’t change the fact that cryptocurrencies are here to stay – and 
here to change the world. This is already happening.  



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             9 

We see an increasing number of companies across a variety of industries making the first 
tentative steps in blockchain adoption. They are realising that there is a pressing need to get 
ahead of the curve and beat the competition. Primary interest in the sector is coming from tech 
giants (Microsoft, IBM, Amazon) and major Wall Street banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup), with 
companies such as Infosys, TCS and HCL reportedly working on blockchain-based products to 
support the financial industry. R3 was the first blockchain company in the financial sector; 
founded in 2014 it now leads a consortium of more than 70 of the world’s biggest financial 
institutions and working on a variety of projects that it is rapidly patenting. 

Meanwhile, the demand for blockchain technology in finance and financial services is growing on 
a worldwide scale, primarily in the developing world. A multitude of economies within Latin 
America, Southeast Asia and Africa have strict currency control laws and are seeing consumers 
flock towards alternatives to mainstream financial institutions. People who have no bank account, 
simply to use alternative financial services, are activating over 1 million smartphones a month. 

In terms of entrepreneurial ventures, we have also seen a clear trend emerge in the last few 
years. Broadly speaking, 2015 was the year when financial institutions and fintech start-ups 
discovered blockchain technology. 2016 was then the year of pilots and first deployments. 
Following on this trend, we project that 2017 will be the year when blockchain enterprise solutions 
leave the pilot phase and proceed to commercialization and wide-scale adoption. 

As we can observe, the large majority of blockchain initiatives are developed within the same 
economic mind frame of profit maximisation. We believe that the intrinsic characteristics and 
innovations of cryptocurrencies can be leveraged in order to have a positive social impact on our 
world. This is at the center of the impak Project. 

Cryptocurrencies are changing the world. They can also have a positive social 
impact. You can either stand beside and observe – or you can become part of 
history in the making.

3. The impak Finance Project 

3.1 Mission 

impak Finance inc. is a Canadian-based corporation founded by entrepreneurs and finance 
professionals wanting to positively contribute and address some of the greatest social and 
environmental issues of our time. The Corporation’s mission is to make money work for positive 
social, innovative and environmental impact through a collaborative financial ecosystem powered 
by disruptive financial technologies developed by the Corporation and third party vendors.  

impak Finance connects investors and consumers who want to change the world for the better 
with entreneurs and sustainable companies who share the same objectives.

3.2 Business Objectives 

As discussed in this White Paper, the Corporation intends to offer integrated lending and 
investment opportunities that are 100% dedicated to the impact economy through an online 
collaborative social network deployed in Canada and in the world. The Corporation intends to 
support local, innovative and sustainable projects. Its mission is to become a leading player in 
collaborative finance dedicated to the growth of the Impact Economy. 

3.3 impak.eco – a collaborative social network for a better world 

impak Finance is designing and developing impak.eco, an online collaborative social network 
100% dedicated to the growth of the Impact Economy. This online network and its mobile 
application will empower Citizens to support and engage in the Impact Economy. By using 
Citizens’ knowledge, skills and purchasing power, impak.eco is giving them a voice and the 
power to better the world around them and allow them to contribute to its sustainability. 

The social network also will bring structure to a very fragmented space: the Impact Economy – 
where even experienced investors have very poor visibility over companies that would represent 
sound investment opportunities because of: (i) a lack of intermediaries specialized in seeking out 
impact companies and qualifying them and (ii) the absence of a coherent and recognized way to 
measure the level of impact of these companies so that investors can make an informed decision.  

Likewise, entrepreneurs and organizations in the impact space seeking capital and sales have 
very few options when it comes to finding value-aligned investors and customers. They have no 
platform dedicated to the social impact space onto which they could put forth the qualities that 
make them attractive impact investment opportunities and recognized impactful products and 
services for responsible consumers. 

The reunion of like-minded Investors, Businesses and Citizens on impak.eco is the basis for a 
true, transactional social network dedicated to the Impact Economy. The abundance in the 
marketplace of sophisticated features, whether from fintechs or other providers allows for the 
creation of a unique user experience that will result in a truly positive habit-forming experience. 

3.3.1 The current models of social networks 

In Finance 
The concept of social network is often brought forth in the fintech and banking industries.  It 
usually represents a combination of stakeholders and technology platforms helping financial 
institutions map their processes and identify influencers. However, in most cases, it offers little or 
no empowerment to its participants. Financial institutions use a top-down approach to improve 
their performance and other stakeholders have very little say in the social network’s interactions 
or composition.  

In Technology 
From a technology standpoint, the past years have seen the rise of several social networks built 
by major players. LinkedIn, Facebook, and Angel List are all great examples of technology-based 
social networks claiming to use technology to forward business and social interaction. At first 
glance, they seem to offer a valid value proposition and have all built great tools to empower their 
communities: newsfeeds, walls, messaging, notifications, geolocation, etc.  



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             12 

However, the plot thickens from a key driver’s perspective. Most of these social networks have 
been designed to use these tools to sell advertising. The tools, user experience and algorithms 
are created to bolster very simplistic metrics: number of people coming to the site, time spent on 
the site and visit recurrence, and that for one single goal: to profit from advertising sales. The 
more eyes on the site, the longer they look at it, the more profitable the provider can be at selling 
advertisements. This therefore creates a strong bias against the macro objectives they put forth in 
bettering society and the economy. 

3.3.2 The impak Finance Approach 

impak Finance’s approach is in fact different. The development of the impak.eco social network is 
done using a human-centered design methodology: a creative approach to interactive systems 
development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, designing 
around their needs and requirements at all stages, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, 
usability knowledge, and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, 
improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability.  

Throughout every phase of development, the target users help co-create and are strongly 
involved in steering the project. The design team has already done workshops with over 400 
businesses and 500 individuals throughout Canada and keeps the co-creation momentum going 
with the involvement of its 1000 retail investors and stakeholders. The design team works with the 
stakeholders it plans to serve. 

Moreover, in line with impak Finance’s core values, this approach is used to empower its users 
and reach the goal of growing the Impact Economy. The systems and technology are designed 
from a bottom-up perspective and establish impak Finance’s role as a facilitator and a catalyst 
towards economic growth. 

Finally, impak Finance’s technological development philosophy is to build products and services 
where an actual added value can be measured. This opens the possibility of unique 
collaborations with a variety of ventures and projects both in fintech and social realm.   

3.3.3 Purpose is our Key Driver 

The key driver behind impak Finance’s social network is the growth of the Impact Economy. Its 
bias is to design tools, calibrate algorithms and refine the user experience to foster the 
sustainability of a real economy based on bettering society and the environment.  

Nowadays, we often interrogate ourselves about the true purpose behind information or the tools 
provided to us on a social platform. Imagine if we built a new platform that truly led to the 
empowerment of oneself or their business. Trusting the key drivers behind a system is imperative 
to impak Finance. 

Empowerment is at the heart of the impak Finance’s project. We are building a financial institution 
that espouses that value and in this world, we believe that it is a competitive advantage. 

3.3.4 The impak Finance social network 

At a grassroots level, this social network involves real businesses, real people and other 
stakeholders of the real economy. Technology is a tool to meet their needs, but even in its 
absence, the ecosystem has to be sustainable. 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             13 

Stakeholders are closely involved in the development of all impak products and services. The 
social network that is currently being built is a technological platform designed to favour the 
Impact Economy by facilitating interactions between 3 main stakeholder categories:  

(i) Impact Organisations (businesses, NGOs, Non-for-Profits, social enterprises) 
which main intention is to better the society and the environment through a 
sustainable business model;  

(ii) Citizens/Retail Customers seeking to have a positive impact by putting their 
money to work according to their values; and 

(iii) Capital Partners (VC, Angel Investors, Family Offices, Foundations, Pension Funds, 
other Institutional Investors) seeking returns with a purpose,  

In simple terms, impak.eco social network is akin to a merger between Facebook, Angel List and 
LinkedIn into one single platform using the current state of their technology to better the Impact 
Economy instead of selling ads. 

3.3.5 The Power of the Triad 

The current platforms available on the market often only recognize the relationship between 2 
stakeholders: retail customers and organisations, businesses and investors, etc. The impak social 
network is designed to leverage the power of 3.  

First and foremost, the underlying design principle is that whether they are businesses, venture 
capital firms or another legal entity, the users on the platform are people first. A user can 
potentially be a business owner, an investor and a retail customer at the same time. This entails 
the creation of unique tool built to leverage all aspects of one’s actions in support of the Impact 
Economy within the ecosystem. 

Secondly, the enrolment mechanisms will ensure that all of one’s contribution in the growth of the 
Impact Economy is taken into account from the outset. Hence, a large part of the initial Retail 
Customers/Citizens group will go through a series of processes, such as KYC (Know-Your-
Customer). For all stakeholders, the design team has planned a friction-less enrolment 
mechanism that outlines how, other than financially, individuals can use their knowledge and 
skills to grow the Impact Economy.  

Thirdly, a series of validation processes (such as BCorp evaluation, community based validation, 
impak Scorecard or due diligence verification) will guarantee that any business present in 
impak.eco will be a positive social impact organisation. Most see these processes as friction 
points in their systems and try to bypass them to rapidly reach critical mass. impak Finance, 
however, sees this as an opportunity to offer a wider range of tools that take advantage of the 
knowledge and skills base stakeholders bring by their presence in impak.eco. 

For example, if a retail customer were a retired business owner in bioscience, his vote or “like” of 
a business in that particular sector would carry weight and credibility. This may also open the 
door to a mentoring relationship with the business owner. With these mechanisms in play, a 
potential investor would see that this business benefits from support, which could in turn 
positively affect his risk analysis. 

The impak.eco design, by considering this triad in its development, is leveraging a larger set of 
data to grow the Impact Economy.

3.3.6 Stakeholders’ Point of View 

Citizens/Retail Customers 
By participating in impak.eco, Retail Customers/Citizens have a voice in supporting the Impact 
Economy and are searching for a way to play a role in improving our environment and society. 
They are much more than just a wallet or a potential transaction in a system and need to be 
recognized for all the attributes they bring. 

The impak social network aims to help Retail Customers/Citizens reach two main goals: (i) easing 
the process to purchase or invest in the Impact Economy and (ii) empowering themselves as 
promoters of growth the Impact Economy, in ways other than their economic activity. 

Impact Organisations/Merchants 
Positive Impact organisations’ core mission embodies their intention to improve the environment 
and society through a sustainable business model. Those positive impact organizations will 
become Accredited Merchants and will be allowed on the ecosystem after being vetted through a 
process involving both the community and impak Finance accreditation filter (impak Scorecard). 
This ensures that the quality of the data in the system remains high, noise-free and impact-
focussed. 

impak.eco aims to do two things in support of the organisations/businesses: help them raise 
capital and generate sales. 

Capital Partners 
Capital partners are impact investors and want to invest in the Impact Economy. Impact investing 
is rapidly growing, worldwide. However, the current lack of unified impact standards and the lack 
of visibility on investment opportunities is a major obstacle to the flow of capital and the growth of 
the sector. 

impak.eco aims to help Capital Partners reach two main goals: have easy access to a curated 
deal flow and facilitate the impact investment process.

3.3.7 impak Coin and impak.eco 

impak Coin and impak.eco have a symbiotic relationship. impak Coin is an important growth 
vector for the Impact Economy within the social network, bringing on one hand a sense of 
purpose and belonging through the execution of transactions in the impact space, and on the 
other hand relieving the friction one finds in usual transactional mechanisms (e.g. transactional 
fees). 

impak.eco brings impak Coin legitimacy and integrity through its rigor and impact validation 
mechanisms (impak Score Card). But it also establishes protocols to provide a valuation system 
for impak Coin. 

3.3.8 Scalability - from Canada to worldwide growth 

Act local, think global, they say! The success of an ecosystem relies heavily on the path to critical 
mass, i.e. obtaining enough actors in the system to generate an optimal level of interactions 
toward the main drivers – in the case of impak.eco: toward the growth of the Impact Economy. 

This is therefore the underlying principle governing the scalability of the system. The impak social 
network aims to scale on 2 main levels: Sectors and Geolocation. In order to scale properly, 
critical mass needs to be first achieved in one specific sector or geolocation to demonstrate its 
value before moving to a new one. 

A good example for this principle is how Facebook has scaled and reached critical mass through 
university campuses before going live to all users across the world.  

For impak.eco, this will be done by launching in the Canadian market where the Impact Economy 
is rapidly growing and where a strong network of businesses, community players and investors 
are supporting impak Finance. Let’s not forget that at the heart of impak.eco lie real people and 
real organisations that have been rallied to the project to co-create as well as scale. In recent 
history, the success of digital social platforms has shown to be in direct relationship to the real 
interactions between entities. The understanding of interactions in the communities of the 
physical world remains a fundamental aspect of scaling impak.eco. That is why impak Finance is 
also working closely with groups and individuals in the impact space to achieve critical mass. 

Also, a series of partnerships are currently being established with other financial institutions, such 
as members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values or certification mechanisms like B-Corp, 
to allow the platform to scale globally while acting locally. It is of utmost importance for impak.eco 
to decentralize its growth and allow for diversity in its scaling process. It is through this process 
that we will be able to show the power of the decorrelation of the Impact Economy to a country’s 
while correlating it to growth based on shared values and sustainability. 

3.4 The impak Scorecard 

The impak Scorecard is the criteria by which all companies on the impak.eco will be judged on 
their level of impact and will become accredited Merchants. As such, it is the central element in 
how choices will be made both by investors looking at investment opportunities and retail 
customers looking for value aligned businesses to provide them with the products and services 
they seek. 

The impak Scorecard criteria are based on the 17 UN Sustainable Objectives. The criteria cover 
Governance, the well being of Employees and the Community, the Environment and the business 
model.

Jean Oulhen 

Co-founder 

Senior Risk 
Management Director 

 

Jean, with a Master of Science in engineering and an Actuary degree, has spent most of 
his career in the banking industry. After 4 years in software R&D, in 2006 he joined 
BPCE, second-ranking banking group in France, where he carried out various projects in 
financial risk and balance sheet management. He led, after the 2008 financial turmoil, the 
team in charge of liquidity management for the group, with the goal of conducting the 
implementation of new Basel III Liquidity regulation within BPCE’s business lines (retail 
and corporate & investment banking). In 2013, he took the opportunity to deal with the 
large & mid-cap corporate clients’ liquidity management products within Natixis (BPCE’s 
CIB subsidiary) Global Transaction Banking division. 
 
In 2015, after observing that the new banking regulations had exacerbated funding 
difficulties for small businesses, Jean co-founded Intérêts Communs in France with 
Armen Ouzounian, bringing alternative finance solutions to SMEs, and connecting them 
to institutional investors. 
 
With the conviction that banking, one of the oldest industries, is going through a crucial 
moment in its history and must evolve to survive, Jean was enthusiastic to join the impak 
Finance endeavor, which fully embodies this necessary evolution towards a better 
finance.

Thus, he negotiated, alongside with other major banks, the Basel 3 framework with the 
authorities and BPCE specificities. 

Business-wise, Armen was part of the task-force that brought BPCE above 100% LCR

web-based bond-emitting tools used in private placement.

4. Building impak Coin (MPK) 

4.1 Summary 

Blockchain technology has been evolving at an unmatched pace. Some of these innovative 
features have been integrated within the original Bitcoin blockchain while some others have been 
integrated to brand new chains of altcoins. There are hundreds of new altcoins created every 
year, many with the purpose of proving these new innovative features.  

impak Coin is one of them. impak Coin is a cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology. It is 
centrally governed by a governing body established by impak Finance and shares its values of 
transparency, stability and purpose. impak Coin is meant to fuel the green, socially responsible 
and the local economies all around the globe. Anyone using the network will be validated during a 
mandatory onboarding process in order to truly have a community that shares our values.  

One major innovative point with impak Coin is its stability. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, it will not 
be traded on exchanges (markets), but rather on a dedicated market managed by impak Finance, 
and at a pre-established price point. This way, impak Coin will be stable in value, contrary to the 
usual offer and demand models.  

impak Coin is part of a new movement called “Blockchain 2.0”. which improves upon existing 
Blockchain infrastructure to support more efficient cryptocurrencies. In other words, this approach 
promotes the usage of meta-cryptocurrencies and meta-blockchain.  In the impak Coin’s case, 
the underlying network is the WAVES Blockchain. 

impak Coin aims to stimulate, to retain, to attract and to orientate capital towards the impact 
economy, hence promoting its growth. Therefore, impak Coin will encourage participating 
members to put their buying power at each other's disposal and keep it circulating within the 
Impact Economy, thereby providing impact enterprises with additional sales volume and loyalty. 

4.2 What is Blockchain technology?  

At its simplest, the blockchain is a digital record stored on a network of computers around the 
world. Instead of securing information by restricting access, the blockchain shares information 
amongst all users. Ownership of funds (for example) is cryptographically verified, and the full 
transparency and mutual ownership of the system means that a bad actor is immediately 
recognisable as such and any transactions submitted by such a node are ignored. The 
decentralised structure of the blockchain brings several key features in contrast to traditional 
centralised approaches:  

• Transparency: it is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one 
account to another.  

• Immutability: once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed. No one can interfere 
with a completed transfer.  

• Low cost: transaction fees are minimal. 

• Cross-border: funds can be sent as easily to someone on the other side of the world as 
they can to someone in the next room.  

• Speed: due to the flat and transparent nature of Blockchain, transfers show up almost 
instantly and are typically confirmed in minutes, rather than hours or days.2

4.3 Why Blockchain 2.0 and WAVES? 

4.3.1 Why Blockchain 2.0 

“Since its inception, blockchain technology has been fraught with controversy over its most 
natural application – value transfer using the network token. Decentralized money is a 
groundbreaking development, but blockchain technology cannot be reduced to this alone. Being 
essentially a distributed database, the blockchain allows for various types of distributed ledger 
entries, the nature of which depends on their interpretation by the blockchain users.”3 

By entering metadata in the ledger, which are encoded and decoded depending on the needs, the 
transactions about a new type of token can be supported by a network that has nothing to do with 
the second layer cryptocurrency (or 2.0). Essentially, the second layer ledger is the gathering of 
precise fractions of the underlying ledger. 

This way, it is possible to create and manage a cryptocurrency without having to support or 
develop a Blockchain infrastructure. The main advantages are security and development costs. In 
its nature, the more users use and validate (no matter the consensus algorithm) a Blockchain, the 
hardest it is the successfully attack. So by leveraging an existing top tier chain/network to host the 
metadata of a second layer cryptocurrency, the security is superior than having to develop it in 
the first hand. These advantages are comparable with those coming from renting a server in the 
cloud instead of buying, deploying and maintaining the physical infrastructure.4  

4.3.2 Why WAVES ? 

“WAVES is a decentralized blockchain platform focusing on custom blockchain tokens 
operations”5 . Exactly made for second layer tokens, WAVES looked like a perfect match for what 
impak Coin envisioned. Digging a little deeper, its PoS consensus model makes it faster and 
greener compared to PoW Blockchains. Despite being a relatively young coin, WAVES market 
cap of $40M showcases its potential and strong codebase. The project managed to attract a 
blasting capital of $16M during the ICO, which is, on par with Ethereum, the largest ICO ever 
made. 

Serious projects are already leveraging the WAVES blockchain for their own second layer 
cryptocurrencies, for example Incent from Australia who raised $1M earlier this year. 

4.4 impak Coin (MPK) Blockchain infrastructure 

impak Coin is also different by its Blockchain infrastructure. impak Coin is part of the movement 
of “Blockchain 2.0”. The philosophy is all about leveraging an existing Blockchain to encode 
metadata instead of first layer transactions. As well as a cryptocurrency transaction, a string of 
characters on a Blockchain could represent pretty much anything like other digital assets or 
securities. That philosophy has enabled new models like Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS). Just 
like cloud computing where you can use the infrastructure without owning it and having to 
manage it, BaaS let you use a Blockchain without having to maintain the network yourself.  In a 
way, we can say that impak Coin’s Blockchain is a meta-Blockchain and impak Coin itself is a 
meta-cryptocurrency.

The chosen underlying Blockchain for impak Coin is WAVES.  WAVES is a PoS Blockchain 
forked from Bitcoin with low block time, low fees and is specifically designed for the integration of 
second layer assets. Due to its PoS nature, it is a greener alternative than PoW blockchains. 

 

impak Coin (MPK) Abstract Stack 

 

4.5 Anonymity 

Every user will have to go through a standard KYC process. Then, every new public key will be 
stapled to its owner identity but this record will not be public. Hence there will be a limited 
anonymity in the impak Coin network. The fact that any transactions or addresses can be tied to a 
physical person eliminates much of the regulatory friction. This system could also enable new 
models for regulators and authority where instead of having to push them the information on 
transactions, they could pull it from the transparent Blockchain. This would make it less of a 
burden for citizens and would benefit authorities since they would have the truth right away. 

4.6 Private keys 

In the impak Coin-centralized system, private keys are never stored on the client’s device. They 
will remain secured within the impak infrastructure. This way, the risks associated with loss or 
theft of a private key are all mitigated by impak Finance which eases that burden for its clients.

4.7 Transactions 

4.7.1 WAVES Transaction Cost to impak Finance 

The transaction fees on the Waves platform are 0.001 WAVES per transaction no matter the size 
of the transaction - this fee is paid by impak Finance (as a matter of comparison, 1 WAVES is 
approximately $0.37 which means 1000 impak Coin transactions would cost $0.37). impak 
Finance is not charging any fees for its infrastructure. 

4.7.2 Transaction speed 

The transaction speed for impak Coin will be somewhere between 1-20 seconds before the first 
confirmation. This is somewhat faster than most other cryptocurrencies. Those speeds are 
achieved due to impak Coin being a second layer Blockchain and because of its underlying PoS 
model. 

4.8 Network Architecture 

It is important to understand the entities within the network and how they interact with each other. 
There are four main player required for the system to work: Apps servers, MPK core, WAVES 
node and the database server. 

4.8.1 Apps servers: 

Some apps servers may be supported by impak Finance, others will be under the control of the 
governance. An example of an application using the MPK is the web wallet, which will be 
developed and maintained by impak Finance. In general, all apps will become an integral part of 
the ecosystem and should be developed using “User Centered Design” principles. Third party 
developers are invited to contribute to the ecosystem by connecting to MPK core API. 

4.8.2 MPK core 

The MPK core acts as the entry point for any application. It will act as the Blockchain core with 
traditional calls6 as well as for internal procedures like onboarding clients and managing money 
supply. 

4.8.3 WAVES node 

The WAVES node could be on the same virtual machines as the MPK core. The node will be the 
gateway for the core to interact with the actual ledger underlying impak Coin. The WAVES node 
could be optional since the interaction could be done with a public WAVES node already on the 
network but there could be security issues if the node gets compromised.

4.8.4 Database server 

The database server is where the sensitive information will be stored. This is why there should be 
extra security measures in place such as an IP whitelist, firewall, encryption of every sensitive 
field and more.  

 

Network architecture 

 

4.9 Stability 

4.9.1 impak Coin Stable Supply 

As impak Coin’s main objective and purpose is to support the growth of the Impact Economy, the 
MPK creation mechanism is designed to be correlated with the growth of the transactions value 
within impak.eco. 

The issuance or revoking of MPKs is made off-chain by the MPK Governance Body. The amount 
is determined to reflect the health of the impak.eco community in a way that if it grows, more can 
be added and if it shrinks, more can be revoked. One of the factors will be the flow between fiat 
and MPKs. To assure transparency at any time, there will be a reserved address for the issuance 
of MPKs. This will allow to openly disclose at any time the amount of MPKs in circulation and the 
moment they were issued. 

4.9.2 Stable Market 

Although impak Coin will be supported by a fully decentralized blockchain (Waves), The MPK 
Governance Body will act as a central bank by regulating the exchange rate and by controlling the 
issuance mechanism. The goal being to assure that impak Coin remains a growth catalyst for the 
impak.eco Merchants that accepts impak Coin-based transactions. Furthermore, the MPK 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             29 

Governance Body will act as the only market maker to stabilize the MPK price. It will do so by 
setting the price of the MPK on a quarterly basis and executing market operations as described 
further in this document. 

4.10 Merchant ecosystem 

4.10.1 Merchant service 

Every accredited impact businesses and organizations (Accredited Merchants) publishing the 
impak Sore Card within impak.eco social network will be granted with an impak Coin merchant 
eWallet (the MPK eWallet). The MPK eWallet will allow them to seamlessly accept payments 
made in MPK. All MPK transactions made to an Accredited Merchant will be free of charge. All 
other transactions, such as exchange into other currencies, will have a transaction fee. This will 
foster the circulation of impak Coin within impak.eco. 

4.10.2 Customer rewards 

Clients are going to be incentivized to spend their impak Coin within impak.eco through a reward 
system. Similar to a cash-back system, clients will receive a % of what they spend as new MPK. 
The exact percentage will be adjusted from time to time by the MPK Governance Body to regulate 
and stabilize the MPK price.  

4.11 Malicious Attack Prevention 

4.11.1 Unauthorized transactions 

It is impossible to eliminate the occurrence of a user account being compromised if someone 
steal/guess/hack their password or device. This is why the MPK Governance Body must have a 
protocol to contest or reverse illegitimate transactions. The main obstacle, however, is that by 
nature the Blockchain ledger is immutable, thus transactions cannot be reversed or canceled.  

The first element of the solution is to create a “black hole” address, an MPK eater of which no one 
will have the private key. Then an “anti-fraud” address should be created with the sole purpose of 
generating new MPKs following the destruction of “dirty”/compromised MPKs.  

Now, every time an unauthorized transaction is identified, the whole amount of the transaction will 
be sent from the receiver account into the “black hole”. After that, new coins will be generated by 
the “anti-fraud” address and will be sent back the to sender of the unauthorized transaction. This 
will do two things; first the balances will be in the same state they were before the malicious 
transaction. Finally, the “black hole” address will make sure that “dirty”/corrupted coins are never 
in circulation after being identified. This way, every MPK on the network will have a clean history 
and it will be possible to easily identify addresses that have been involved with malicious actions.

4.11.2 Private Key Management System Compromised 

A system must be in place in the occurrence of a hacker gaining total access to the infrastructure 
including the private key management system in which every private key is stored. In the case, 
the main concern is to authorize fraudulent withdrawals and transactions. So first thing will be to 
block all CAD withdrawals and signal that transactions are disabled. Then, a recovery system will 
take care to duplicate valid data onto a brand new Blockchain with their own distinct private/public 
keys. 

The recovery system will create a new asset on the WAVES network. From this new asset, pair of 
keys will be generated for every account registered in the KYC database. Once every key is 
regenerated onto the new Blockchain, the recovery system will chronologically duplicate any 
transaction made on the compromised Blockchain onto the new one until the point where the 
infrastructure has been compromised. Finally, once the new asset is at the desired state, every 
key from the old system will be wiped and the MPK core will now be redirected on the new asset 
that will become the main impak Coin asset. 

Hence, even if the hacker has a duplicate of every keys and enters what he want in the “old” 
compromised Blockchain, the old asset will not be recognized by any means as an MPK since the 
MPK core will reference the “new” Blockchain.  

4.11.3 Cashback System Abuse 

To prevent abuse in the cashback system, bonuses will not be drawn directly from the raw 
outgoing amount of one’s address. It will be calculated instead from the flow of MPKs between 
each individual with which one has transacted with. The flow is basically the difference between 
the income and outcome between each pair of individuals. Any overlapping flow between two 
users will be deducted from the rewardable outcome. This system makes the abuse of the

cashback system much more difficult, since no matter how many people are involved in the fraud, 
only the ones with a positive flow will receive cashback. 

One the example below, user C and D have an overlapping flow for of 50 MPK which makes that 
50 MPK not eligible for cashback.

5. The MPK Crowdsale 

5.1 The Impact Economy 

The Impact Economy is a new market force underpinned by companies, entrepreneurs and 
investors that have the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a 
financial return. Impact entrepreneurs are pursuing business opportunities that will both generate 
profit and address endemic social problems. 

5.2 impak Coin (MPK): the first cryptocurrency with social purpose 

impak Coin is the first complementary currency leveraging the power of cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain to support and accelerate the growth of the Impact Economy.  

• It is the first crypto currency with a purpose combining the orientation power of 
complementary currencies with the decentralized scalability and usability of a 
blockchain currency. 

• The way it is designed and coded, impak Coin will be the first stable cryptocurrency 
supporting the growth of the Impact Economy.  

• impak Coin’s purpose is to encourage participating members to put their buying power 
at each other's disposal and keep it circulating within the Impact Economy, thereby 
providing impact enterprises with additional sales volume and loyalty. 

• impak Coin may even dampen downturns in the business cycle, helping to stabilize and 
grow the Impact Economy during difficult times.  

• The use of impak Coin may result in increased sales, cash flow and profits for Impact 
Organizations (Accredited Merchants) within the impak.eco social network. 

• impak Coin is a "coup de force" against the "diversion" by banks of a "public service" 
mission: monetary creation and real economy stimulation.

5.5 Designed to accelerate  growth of the Impact Economy 

Every accredited impact business and organization (Accredited Merchant) publishing their impak 
Scorecard within impak.eco will be granted an MPK merchant eWallet (MPK eWallet). The MPK 
eWallet will allow seamless acceptance of payments made in MPK. All impak Coin transactions 
made to an Accredited Merchant will be free of charge. All other transactions, such as exchange 
into other currencies, will have a transaction fee. This will foster the circulation of MPKs within 
impak.eco. 

Although any merchants (non impak accredited) and individuals will be able to own, accept, buy 
and sell MPKs at the listed market price, the cost of selling MPKs will favor the use of MPKs 
within impak.eco.  

On the other hand, spending cryptocurrencies or fiat money (mostly CAD in the initial deployment 
phase) within impak.eco will be rewarded: on each transaction executed with Accredited 
Merchants, the buyer will be granted an MPK cash-back representing a % of the transaction. This 
cash-back system will be the main currency creation process.  (see MPK Supply section 5.9) 

5.6 impak Coin Aligns Incentives to Grow the Impact Economy 

Imagine a world where merchants could reward customers instantly, with a digital asset that 
never expires and appreciates in value. Would you not shop with a merchant who offered such a 
powerful reward?  

impak Coin represents for its holders access to products and services offered by Accredited 
Merchants (businesses and organizations) part of the impak.eco network. 

By combining the values of complementary currencies and the power of crypto-currencies, we 
believe impak Coin will have an impressive accelerating effect for the Impact Economy by 
aligning its users incentives towards the support of this positive economy. Secondly, an Open API 
approach will encourage third party developers to add functionalities to the impak Coin ecosystem 
bridging to further growth of the network. 

5.7 Initial impak Coin (MPK) Supply 

The initial amount of MPKs created in this Crowdsale will be a minimum of 575,000 MPK to a 
maximum of 11,500,000 MPK.

The Initial Holders of MPK of the Crowdsale will be subject to the following escrow schedule:  



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             35 

• 1/4 tradable immediately at launch of MPK eWallet 
• 1/4 tradable 6 months following MPK eWallet launch 
• 1/4 tradable 12 months following MPK eWallet launch 
• 1/4 tradable 18 months following MPK eWallet launch 

5.8 MPK supply will be correlated to the growth of the Impact Economy 

As impak Coin’s main objective and purpose is to support the growth of the Impact Economy, the 
MPK creation mechanism was designed to be correlated with the growth of the Impact Economy. 
The main MPK creation mechanisms are as follows: 

5.8.1 MPK cash-back percentage per transaction* 

Most of the impak Coin supply will be created on an ongoing basis each time a transaction in 
cryptocurrencies or in FIAT money occurs through an Accredited Merchant MPK eWallet. The 
amount of MPKs created will represent a % of the transaction and will be automatically credited to 
the buyer’s eWallet at the end of each month. Similar to a cash-back system, the % will be 
adjusted from time to time by the MPK Governance Body to regulate and stabilize the MPK price.  

The planned schedule of the MPK cash-back % applied during the first year following the impak 
Coin launch is: 

 

MPK creation (cash-back%) schedule  

Launch Phase (0-3 months) 10 % 

Phase 1 (3-6 months) 7% 

Phase 2 (6+ months) 5 % 

*This	 schedule	may	 change	and	differ	 in	 time	and	 impak	Finances	 reserves	 the	 right	 to	modify	one	or	 all	 of	 those	
figures	and	conditions.		

5.8.2 MPK creation to incentivise usage 

MPKs may be created and credited to users at the end of the month for actions promoting the 
usage of the impak Coin. Examples of such transactions and rewards could be: 

• impak mobile app (wallet) installation:  25 MPK 

• first transaction with impak merchant:  10 MPK 

• a referred friend registering:   5 MPK 

• inviting personal network to impak.eco:  10 MPK 

Other activities could also trigger MPK creation for an impak.eco user; i.e. commenting, 
participating in a co-creation activity, mentorship, recommending, etc. 

 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             36 

The MPK Governance Body may choose to cancel MPKs when buying them back, or to create 
new MPKs through a crowd sale or otherwise as long as it results in supporting impak Coin’s 
main purpose. 

5.8.3 MPK-CAD Conversion Fee 

In order to be financially sustainable and cover its operating costs, impak Finance will apply 
transaction fees of 2% on MPK conversions to CAD. 

5.8.4 MPK Governance Body 

The impak Foundation will create, be a founding member of and oversee the MPK Governance 
Body which will be the institution managing the MPK supply and market. The MPK Governance 
Body will be composed of third party value aligned members all active in the Impact Economy. 
Those members will meet quarterly and determine the Monetary Policy and the action to be taken 
in order to support the stability of the MPK. 

5.8.5 Stability of the MPK Value 

Although impak Coin will be supported by a fully decentralized blockchain (Waves), The MPK 
Governance Body will control the value of the MPK through (a) the quarterly setting of the 
exchange rate, and (b) market operations like buying or selling MPKs on its marketplace with its 
own CAD and MPK reserve, adjusting transaction fees, adjusting the % in MPK cash-back and 
issuing new MPKs..  

The goal is to ensure the impak Coin remains a growth catalyst for the impak.eco merchants that 
accept MPK-based transactions.  

5.9 Open and trustworthy 

We are convinced that the more impact businesses (Accredited Merchants) will have access to 
impak.eco social network, the more they will make use of impak Coin, and the more the impak 
Coin will be useful to them. Therefore, we want this ecosystem to be open, and we will welcome 
all organizations that work to nurture the Impact Economy as part of impak.eco. Value aligned 
credit unions and financial institutions, incubators, certification organizations, etc. will be invited to 
join the MPK Governance Body and will be allowed to grant eWallets to the impact businesses 
and organizations they work with. The impak ecosystem, together with impak Coin, will become 
stronger as it attracts players in the impact sector, and as it relies less on impak Finance for its 
growth. 

Although only MPK Governance Body members will be able to qualify businesses as “impact 
organizations” (Accredited Merchants) benefiting of such advantages as no transactions fees, 
impak Finance will publish the API allowing anyone to create eWallet applications that trade in 
MPKs. 

5.10 Low cost and energy efficient 

We choose Waves’ blockchain-as-a-service solution to support impak Coin.  



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             37 

“WAVES is a decentralized blockchain platform focusing on custom blockchain tokens operations. 
National currencies transfer is maintained on the WAVES blockchain through compliant gateway 
operators. Decentralized token exchange facilitates fundraising, crowdfunding, and trading of 
financial instruments on the blockchain. Lightweight clients provide an easy installation procedure 
and a flat learning curve for end users.“ 7  

Harnessing an already well-established blockchain like Waves will bring impak Coin robustness, 
security and performances. Waves currently validates a transaction block under 15 seconds and 
each transaction comes with a very small fee, which allows impak Coin to handle retail 
transactions. Those fees absorb the cost of maintaining the blockchain infrastructure.  

Waves also uses Proof-Of-Stake consensus algorithm which is many times more energy efficient 
than the Proof-Of-Work used by other well-known blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum and that is 
known to be a major carbon energy waste.  

MPK infrastructure will consist of a layer between MPK eWallets (clients) and Waves blockchain. 
This layer will provide the API allowing clients to make transactions and encode those to Waves. 
It will also implement all transactions rules aimed to support the impak Coin.  

5.11 Compliant 

Managing our own layer of software to validate transactions will allow us to implement compliancy 
rules that every financial institution has to follow: anti money laundering, taxes declarations. A 
KYC process will be mandatory to open an MPK eWallet, and even if transactions will appear as 
anonymous on the Waves blockchain, users’ identity will be known by the MPK Governance 
Body, which  will have the responsibility to disclose unusual transactions to authorities as well as 
to provide all information required by tax authorities. During the initial deployment phase, only 
impak Finance will be allowed to create MPK eWallets (with respect to the KYC process). Further 
in time, value aligned third parties may be entitled by the MPK Governance Body to create MPK 
eWallets and maintain such processes.

5.13 The time is now 

We see an increasing number of companies across a variety of industries making the first 
tentative steps in blockchain adoption. They are realising that there is a pressing need to get 
ahead of the curve and beat the competition. Primary interest in the sector is coming from tech 
giants (Microsoft, IBM, Amazon) and major Wall Street banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup), with 
companies such as Infosys, TCS and HCL reportedly working on blockchain-based products to 
support the financial industry. R3 was the first blockchain company in the financial sector; 
founded in 2014 it now leads a consortium of more than 70 of the world’s biggest financial 
institutions and working on a variety of projects that it is rapidly patenting. 

Meanwhile, the demand for blockchain technology in finance and financial services is growing on 
a worldwide scale, primarily in the developing world. A multitude of economies within Latin 
America, Southeast Asia and Africa have strict currency control laws and are seeing consumers 
flock towards alternatives to mainstream financial institutions. People who have no bank account, 
simply to use alternative financial services, are activating over 1 million smartphones a month. 

In terms of entrepreneurial ventures, we have also seen a clear trend emerge in the last few 
years. Broadly speaking, 2015 was the year when financial institutions and fintech startups 
discovered blockchain technology. 2016 was then the year of pilots and first deployments. 
Following on this trend, we project that 2017 will be the year when blockchain enterprise solutions 
leave the pilot phase and proceed to commercialization and wide-scale adoption. 

As we can observe, the large majority of blockchain initiatives are developed within the same 
economic mind frame of profit maximisation. We believe that the intrinsic characteristics and 
innovations of cryptocurrencies can be leveraged in order to have a positive social impact on our 
world. This is at the center of the impak Project.

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are changing the world. They can also have a 
positive social impact. You can either stand beside and observe – or you can 
become part of history in the making. 
For us, 2017 is the year to use blockchain technology to invite every Citizen in supporting 
impactful enterprises of the real economy wanting to make your world a better place. We believe 
that the technology is finally ready to be utilized in the real world by a large population. 

Through the impak Coin launch we are paving the way for other organizations to follow suit. We 
are creating a state-of-the-art model to attract citizens wanting to transform our economies 
towards a more decentralized model, following the worldwide trend. The technology we are using 
highlights scalability and security. We have also laid out a governance roadmap which solves 
many of the grey areas previous blockchain-based investments have found challenging.  

We know that the internet was somewhat of a niche novelty until the browsers, email clients, 
search engines and online retailers came along. Then, suddenly, it became a household 
necessity. With blockchain, it has taken years to build up the basic infrastructure rooted in 
cryptocurrency. 2017 will be the year when this all finally takes off.

6. Risk Factors 

Participation in this Crowdsale should only be made after consulting with independent and 
qualified sources advice. Participation in this Crowdsale at this time is highly speculative due to 
the stage of the Corporation’s development and requirement to raise additional financing to carry 
out its long-term business plan. Participants must rely on management of the Corporation. Any 
participation in this Crowdsale at this stage involves a high degree of risk.  

6.1 THIS IS NOT A PROSPECTUS OF ANY SORT 

This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, it is not a solicitation for 
investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction 
Worldwide. This White Paper constitutes a description of the functionality of the impak Coin 
(MPK) system. 

6.2 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 

6.2.1 Limited operating history in an evolving industry 

The Corporation has no operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as 
expected. Assessing its business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and 
difficulties it may encounter. These risks and difficulties include its ability to: 

• navigate complex and evolving regulatory and competitive environments; 

• increase the number of customers; 

• successfully maintain and evolve our internal controls to manage compliance with an 
evolving and complex regulatory environment; 

• improve the terms on which the Corporation lends to its customers as its business 
becomes more efficient; 

• increase the effectiveness of its direct marketing and ability to identify the trends 
relevant to its targeted demographics; 

• successfully develop and deploy new products; 

• successfully maintain its funding strategy; 

• favorably compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, 
the business of financial services to its targeted demographics; 

• successfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the financial services 
market; 

• effectively manage the growth of its business; 

• successfully expand its business; 

• continue to revise its platform’s proprietary credit model; 

• continue to develop, maintain and scale its platform; 

• effectively use limited personnel and technology resources; 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             42 

• effectively maintain and scale its financial and risk management controls and 
procedures; 

• maintain the security of its platform and the confidentiality of the information provided 
and utilized across its platform; and 

• attract, integrate and retain an appropriate number of qualified employees.  

	

6.2.2 No assurance of profitability 

• The Corporation operates at a loss and there is no assurance that the Corporation will 
ever be profitable.  

6.2.3 The financial services industry is highly regulated 

The Corporation’s business is subject to numerous federal, provincial and other local laws, 
ordinances and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which are subject to 
change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way the Corporation 
conducts or expands its business. These regulations govern, or affect, among other things: 

• lending and collection practices, such as truth in lending and short-term and instalment 
lending and continuous payment authority; 

• interest rates and usury; 

• loan amount and fee limitations; 

• licensing and posting of fees; and 

• privacy of personal consumer information. 

 

As the Corporation develops and introduces new products and services, it may become subject to 
additional laws and regulations. Future legislation or regulations may restrict the Corporation’s 
ability to continue its current methods of operation or expand its operations and may have a 
negative effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future 
legislation or regulations, or amendments to existing regulatory regime, could require the 
Corporation to modify its platform and processes, which may cause the Corporation to incur 
additional costs. 

6.2.4 There is no guarantee that the Corporation will obtain status as a 
Schedule I Bank under the Bank Act. 

After the completion of the Crowdsale and subject to receiving sufficient funds, the Corporation 
intends to apply to obtain status as a Schedule I Bank as defined under the Bank Act. There is no 
guarantee as to when the Corporation will obtain status as a Schedule I Bank, or if it will ever 
obtain such status. If the Corporation’s application is rejected, the Corporation will modify its 
business plan and it could adversely affect the Corporation’s business and financial condition.  

6.2.5 Personal data 

The Corporation receives, transmits and stores a large volume of personally identifiable 
information and other sensitive data from its customers and potential customers. There are 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             43 

federal, provincial and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure 
and protection of personally identifiable information and sensitive data. Specifically, personally 
identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations to protect the privacy 
of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted. Any violations of these laws 
and regulations may require the Corporation to change its business practices or operational 
structure, address legal claims and sustain monetary penalties and/or other harms to its 
business.  

The regulatory framework for privacy issues in Canada is constantly evolving and is likely to 
remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The interpretation and application of such laws is 
often uncertain, and such laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with the 
Corporation’s current policies and practices or require changes to the features of its platform. If 
either the Corporation or its third-party service providers are unable to address any privacy 
concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in 
additional costs and liability, damage its reputation and harm its business. 

6.2.6 Additional capital may be required 

The Corporation intends to continue to make investments to support the growth of its business. 
As such, it may require additional capital to pursue its business objectives and respond to 
business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including increasing its 
marketing expenditures to improve its brand awareness, developing new products or services or 
further improving existing products or services, enhancing its operating infrastructure and 
acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, it may need to engage in 
equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be 
available when the Corporation needs them, on terms that are acceptable to the Corporation, or 
at all. In addition, the Corporation’s agreements with other lenders may make it more difficult for it 
to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.  

If the Corporation raises additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt 
securities, its existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities 
the Corporation issues could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders 
of its common stock. If the Corporation is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on 
terms satisfactory to the Corporation, when it requires, its ability to continue to pursue its 
business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen 
circumstances could be significantly limited, and its business, operating results, financial 
conditions and prospects could be adversely affected.  

6.2.7 Security breaches of customer's’ confidential information 

The Corporation stores customers’ personal and banking information and other sensitive data. 
Any accidental or wilful security breaches or other unauthorized access could cause the theft and 
criminal use of this data. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information 
could also expose the Corporation to liability related to the loss of the information, time-
consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached 
because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in the 
Corporation’s software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains 
unauthorized access to any of its customers’ data, the Corporation’s relationships with its 
customers will be severely damaged, and the Corporation could incur significant liability.  

Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change 
frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the 
Corporation and third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to 
implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, certain provinces have enacted laws 



 
 

 
                         © impak Finance inc. 2017                                             44 

requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. 
These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead 
to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Corporation’s customers to lose 
confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual 
or perceived, would harm its reputation and the Corporation may lose customers.  

6.2.8 If products and platform enhancements do not achieve sufficient market 
acceptance 

The Corporation incurs expenses and expends resources upfront to develop, acquire and market 
new products and platform enhancements to incorporate additional features, improve functionality 
or otherwise make its platform more desirable to its customers.  

6.2.9 It may be difficult and costly to protect the intellectual property rights, and 
the Corporation may not be able to ensure their protection. 

The Corporation’s ability to service its customers depends, in part, upon its intellectual property. It 
primarily relies on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and 
confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, customers and others to protect its 
intellectual property rights. However, the steps it takes to protect its intellectual property rights 
may be inadequate. The Corporation currently does not have any issued patents.  

In order to protect its intellectual property rights, the Corporation may be required to spend 
significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce 
its intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and 
could result in the impairment or loss of portions of its intellectual property. Furthermore, its efforts 
to enforce its intellectual property rights may be met with defences, counterclaims and 
countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of its intellectual property rights. The 
Corporation’s failure to secure, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights could seriously 
harm its brand and adversely affect its business.  

6.2.10 The Corporation’s success and future growth depend in part on its 
successful marketing efforts and increased brand awareness. 

The Corporation believes that an important component of its growth will be continued market 
penetration through its direct marketing channel. To achieve this growth, the Corporation 
anticipates relying heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of the impak 
brand with potential customers. The goal of this marketing and advertising is to increase the 
strength, recognition and trust in the impak brand, drive more unique visitors to submit 
applications on its mobile platform, and ultimately increase the number of customers banking with 
the Corporation or the number of loans made to its customers.  

If the Corporation is unable to recover its marketing costs through an increase in the number of 
saving accounts opened and in the number of loans made, or if it discontinues its broad 
marketing campaigns, it could have a material adverse effect on its growth, results of operations 
and financial condition.

6.2.11 The Corporation relies on its management team and need additional key 
personnel to grow its business, and the loss of key employees or inability 
to hire key personnel could harm its business. 

The Corporation believes its success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and 
talents of its executives and employees, including Paul Allard, Vikash Jain, Tima Gros, Philippe 
Gablain, Pierre-Étienne Vachon, François Le Bel, Stéphane Dumont, Armen Ouzounian and Jean 
Oulhen. Its future success depends on its continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and 
retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and the 
Corporation may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of its 
senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect its ability to execute its 
business plan and strategy, and it may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely 
basis, or at all.  

6.2.12 Litigation may adversely affect the Corporation’s business and financial 
condition. 

The Corporation’s business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, customers, 
consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private 
actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The 
outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property 
claims, is difficult to assess or quantity. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of 
very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these 
lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these 
lawsuits, if decided adversely to the Corporation or settled by the Corporation, may result in 
liability material to its financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect its operating results 
if changes to its business operations are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be 
significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively 
affect customer perception of its business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or 
whether the Corporation are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect its 
business and financial condition.

6.3.4 No guaranties of liquidity for the MPK.  

There is absolutely no guarantee that impak Coin holders will be able to sell Coins through the 
MPK marketplace as there is a high risk of having no buyers or sellers if the impak Project is not 
a commercial success. Consequently, it may be difficult or even impossible for Users to sell 
impak Coins. 

6.3.5 Restrictions on resale of MPK.  

There are restrictions on resale of the impak Coin for participants of this Crowd sale. Such 
restrictions on resale are described in Section 5.3 of this White Paper. 

6.3.6 MPKs are not insured. 

The Corporation is not a member institution of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
MPKs pre-sold in this crowdsale are not insured against loss.  

6.3.7 Less than Full Amount pre-sold 

There can be no assurance that more than the minimum amount will be pre-sold. In that case, 
less than the maximum funds will be available to the Corporation and, consequently, its 
technology development and business development plans and prospects could be adversely 
affected.  

6.3.8 Changes in Legislation 

There can be no assurance that income tax laws and laws relating to the industry in which the 
Corporation operates will not be changed in a manner which adversely affects the Corporation 
business plan. 

6.3.9 Absence of validation of the information provided to the Corporation and 
reproduced in this White Paper

about such persons or about activities of any other person than the Corporation has not been at 
this stage verified by the Corporation and as such, might not be accurate in whole or in part and 
no one shall rely on any of such information for the purposes of participating in the Crowdsale. 

6.3.10 Tax Matters 

impak Coin usage is subject to changes in Canadian federal and provincial tax laws, tax 
proposals, other governmental policies or regulations and governmental, administrative or judicial 
interpretation of the same. There can be no assurance that tax laws, tax proposals, policies or

regulations, or the interpretation thereof, will not be changed in a manner which will fundamentally 
alter the tax consequences to impak Coin holders acquiring, holding or disposing of MPKs.  

For all of the aforesaid reasons and others set forth and not set forth herein, impak Coin involves 
a certain degree of risk. Any person considering the purchase of MPKs should be aware of these 
and other factors set forth in this White Paper and should consult with his/her legal, tax and 
financial advisors prior to making an investment in MPKs. MPKs should only be purchased by 
persons who can afford to lose all of their total investment.
