BRICBIT - WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT 

Everyone would like to own a property in London; after all, it is regarded as the most 
robust property market in the World.
 
Investors see London property as a safe haven, a protector of wealth.
 
When global financial markets were crashing in late 2008, with stocks markets down by 
40% and more, London property remained incredibly resilient, many properties avoiding 
any downside. 

Since March 2009, central London property has seen capital growth nearing 80% and is 
now, once again reaching record highs.

The London property market is one of the most dynamic in the world, and represents a 
great investment opportunity, but is currently inaccessible for 99% of the world’s 
population.

BRICBIT MAKES LONDON PROPERTY INVESTMENT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE… 
WORLDWIDE!

• Mayfair

TURNING PROPERTY NIGHTMARES INTO PROSPEROUS DREAMS

Most people who have bought an investment property can tell many stories about the 
challenges of being a landlord, particularly if they live in another time zone. 

If you buy property, where do you buy? How well do you know the area? Who is the best 
agent? How can you compare the performance of agents? How much paperwork is 
involved? Who will manage the property? How much will it cost? What happens when the 
boiler breaks or the tenant accidentally leaves on the gas? Your phone rings in the middle 
of the night, the tenant is furious about this or demands that? The list goes on and on… 
With BRICBIT there is a big difference.

In short, BRICBIT gives you the best property investment, structured and managed on 
your behalf by our highly respected specialist team. 

You, as an owner of BRICBIT; sit back, relax and benefit from exceptional and sustained 
capital growth with none of the downside.

WHY HAS PRIME GREATER LONDON BEEN CHOSEN AS THE
LOCATION FOR ASSET-BACKED INVESTMENT?

An analysis of the historic rates of capital uplift in residential properties with in Prime 
Greater London reveals that there has been a 100% increase circa every 10 years since 
1952. We have selected Prime Greater London as our initial target area as this location has 
significantly outperformed any other areas within the United Kingdom. Prime Greater 
London has also offered a high level of capital preservation as documented in recent 
times.

Investment within property always predicates a medium to long-term view. Defined, value 
driven strategies have been established, that deliver sustained growth and unprecedented 
resilience. 

The Founders of BRICBIT look forward to offering London property ownership, coupled 
with our proven track record, to a Worldwide audience. This product offers investors 
greater capital preservation by investing in London.

Simply put, London is the most resilient and documented property market in the World 
and BRICBIT makes it accessible for people in every part of the World.

THE RIGHT MARKET

“In these times of uncertainty in both 
financial and currency markets, property, 
and certainly central London Property is 
Europe’s new investment bank.”  
Chesterton Humberts quoted in The 
Telegraph, national British newspaper.

Supply remains restricted due to low levels 
of properties being offered to the market 
and the difficulties faced by developers.

The ongoing supply and demand 
imbalance means that London will be 
fundamentally insulated from the market 
weakness which the rest of the country 
may be facing.

The population of London is expected to 
grow significantly over the coming years 
(over 1 million or more by 2030) through a 
combination of internal and external 
factors, such as inward migration.

THE BLOCKCHAIN FOR BRICKS AND MORTAR

Blockchain technology is revolutionising the world, both in business and how we interact 
with each other. Utilising this technology and combining it with a traditional property 
investment model, BRICBIT is a unique offering that will disrupt conventional thinking in 
this space.

Property benefits from consistent, low volatility total returns over time, with certain 
properties providing greater opportunities for growth. In the key property markets of the 
World, there is sustained domestic and foreign demand, which in turn leads to increased 
capital values. This is true of London more than any other city in the World.

BRICBIT will offer direct exposure to the London market. Through acquisition of physical 
property, BRICBIT, as a currency, will be backed by a hard asset class. BRICBIT opens the 
door to anyone to own property at any level. Whether you buy one BRICBIT or lots of 
BRICBIT, everyone can now own London property. BRICBIT combines blockchain 
technology with a truly cross border effect, bringing people into the new world of 
cyryptocurrency by merging it with a centuries old understanding: land and property. 

The price of BRICBIT is not the same as its value. BRICBIT’s price will be determined by 
the market in which it trades; by means of supply and demand (buying and selling). It is 
the ongoing interaction between buyers and sellers trading that determines the specific 
price of BRICBIT.

However, when determining price, one must also consider the amount that buyers are 
currently willing to pay for the ‘future’ value of BRICBIT. In other words, if the market 
believes the price of something – like BRICBIT or its’ property – will increase in the future, 
they are more likely to pay for it now.
