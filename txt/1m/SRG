The online games market is constantly evolving and brings billions of dollars to its owners, thanks to 

in-app purchases made by users. The volume of the global e-commerce market in the online games 

segment was 95.2 billion USD in 2016 and is growing rapidly. However, developers are faced with 

two key problems that hamper monetization:

But since these marketing efforts are directed 

at a broad and not targeted group of 

customers, the effectiveness of such actions 

leaves much to be desired. At the same time, 

CPI costs are growing by 7% annually, and the 

average cost of loyal users is now USD 2.90 per 

person (USD 1.44 in 2015), it is growing by 61% 

annually.

Game developers have to spend more than 

At the moment, the first issue has mostly been solved, thanks to the following tools: 

Where to �nd new players

How to increase the average check made by a player

Advertising on video hosting sites

Advertising in streaming services

CPI networks

Contextual advertising

30–40% of their revenues on advertising to stay 

in the top and keep a steady traffic of 

motivated players. Old advertising formats 

require more money and become less effective. 

Marketers in the games segment have only one 

real option to cope with this problem: to find a 

completely new way of attracting and retaining 

players.

On average, 750 games are added every day in 

the App Store and Google Play. The vast 

majority of them receive no attention from 

players. Only the games of major developers 

and a few lucky ones are in the top for several 

months or sometimes even years. 

There is no secret here: large developers, with 

their large advertising budgets, are squeeze out 

small projects. For example, Clash of Clans 

spends more than 3 million USD per day on 

advertising, and this, of course, brings results, 

such as �rst-place ranking and pro�ts of almost 

1 billion USD in 2016.

But there is another, less expensive method: 

so-called viral advertising. There are many 

examples of viral advertising, one of the most 

famous is the game Angry Birds. During the 

�rst two months after its release in 2009, it was 

downloaded more than two million times. A 

year later, there were already more than 50 

million downloads. One more year later, the 

game was downloaded more than 250 million 

times. Many people have racked their brains 

over why Angry Birds has become so popular. 

Whether it’s the properties of the human 

psyche or the gameplay simply worked well, 

the players literally disconnect from reality and 

concentrate all their attention on their 

smartphones. Back in 2009, the company had 

no advertising budget, and it was viral 

marketing that helped Angry Birds to become 

one of the highest-ranked applications on the 

planet.

Today many large American corporations, 

including Microsoft and Anheuser-Busch 

Companies, already actively use viral marketing 

to promote their products. The essence of viral 

marketing lies in the dissemination of 

information through personal 

recommendations. A “virus” is created on 

forums, blogs, and communities: the original 

message about the product, which, if the 

audience is interested, will make the rounds 

and be actively discussed, generating a huge 

targeted tra�c. Usually, this is the combination 

of small groups of people, friends, or colleagues 

into one full-�edged community with its own 

ideology. This targeted tra�c is e�ective 

because users become part of the project 

voluntarily and do not need additional 

motivation. 

Another example of successful monetization in 

the world of online games is Dota. Today this 

project has not only great conceptual 

component, but also good gameplay. But back 

in 2004, when the �rst version was Dota 

Allstars, it was an under-developed system, which did not, however, prevent the Dota community from 

growing by one million players every month, due to viral marketing. This project has undergone several 

modi�cation and is considered one of the best games of the 21st century. The internal Dota community 

is one of the largest gaming communities in the world, which indicates a strong motivation among 

players and their desire for development in the project.  Today there are more than 2.2 billion players in 

the world, and many players make an attempt to earn real assets in virtual reality. After conducting an 

analytical review and interviewing more than 200 players, our team came to the conclusion that the 

current and popular methods at the moment are: Promoting accounts, reselling intra-game items or

attempt to open Youtube, Twitch channel with the possibility of receiving donations and advertising.

 

But one way or another, the player faces di�culties, in particular: �nding start-up capital or acquiring 

skills for full-time work, and often because of the emerging barriers, the player refuses this opportunity 

because he does not know where to start. In the process of thinking, we wondered if Angry Birds and 

Dota had succeeded because of viral marketing, then why do not we monetize viral marketing for other 

online projects and players? Our team has decided to create a system that allows players to go through 

quest training and earn assets in the form of a crypto currency, while developers will spend less money 

on advertising and more e�ciently spend their assets to improve the game project

Principles of viral
marketing



We have 2 tokens type:

The concept of the SRG (Support Rich Games) project was based on the problems of game developers. 

The SRG Community is the �rst decentralized intra-gaming platform based on the principle of a loyalty 

program and a referral system using the Ethereum smart contract. 

The project is an application that will be integrated with both PC and mobile games. Our task is to unite 

a target stream of players by connecting small gaming communities. In this system, players who have 

become project partners (referrer) will be able to earn money on referral programs, developing their 

own business within the game space.

The SRG Community  creates an internal ecosystem with tools for promotion and the possibility of 

quest training for project partners (referrer). We form a target group of users, based on the principle of 

viral marketing. Thus, game developers will be able to save and more e�ectively spend funds allocated 

for advertising and invest the majority of the funds in improving the game itself.  We are interested in 

creation a full-�edged social system, where all referrals are interconnected. Thus, we will be able to 

build a complete motivation system and keep motivated tra�c in partner gaming projects. By 

providing the opportunity for players to receive real rewards, we can solve the conversion issue of 

increasing the average check, as users will have additional money, which, in most cases, will be spent 

on game projects.

Gameplay point (GMP) - tokens which use in 

SRG community for internal payments to 

referrer.

SRG token (SRG) - pro�t share tokens which will 

be sold during ICO, this tokens give you 

opportunity to get pro�t once every six 

months.

Principles of the Operation
For users:
The SRG application will be available in 2 versions:

1. For personal computers (Windows, Mac OS).

2. For mobile platforms (iOS, Android).

The version for PC and Mac will have advanced capabilities. Any user can download the application or 

click on the referral link, register and become a member of the SRG Community.

9SRG Comunity

For developers:
As the module is universal and can be integrated into any application (PC or Mobile), this means that after 

approval and integration by the developers, all players will be updated at the same time and our platform 

will appear.

After users update the game, they will gain access to the additional tab to switch to the SRG platform. In 

the future, if users are interested, they can register and become the members of the SRG Community.

Example:
We have collaborated with a game project that has a user base of about 300,000 players. After 

integration, all users of the game will have access to the SRG platform. Since our platform is 

browser-based, we are suitable for all categories of both PC and Mobile. Subsequently, according to 

our forecasts, at least 5–7% of players will register to try out the system and become partners of the 

project—these are our referrers, who will generate the pro�t.  Our customers are all players of online 

games, it's about 2.2 billion people. At the moment, many players want to earn real assets, but 

unfortunately only a few games provide this opportunity and then with the help of marketplace. 

Now such opportunities are used, are user by no more than 0.1% of players in the world. We want to 

give the opportunity to earn all the players regardless of whether there are internal marketplace or 

not. Having provided an opportunity to earn, we will increase conversion rates, due to the receipt of 

new assets from all. As I said earlier, we plan to move forward by integrating our service into online 

games and enabling players to connect to the system SRG community.

The referrer of the SRG community will receive 

a reward in GMP tokens.

GMP is a multi-�eld, new-generation game 

cryptocurrency that can be spent in any game 

connected to the SRG system. The token can 

also be converted and sent to a personal wallet 

in Ethereum tokens. 

The cost of GMP according to which tokens are 

issued and redeemed is USD 0.1. 

This does not exclude the possibility of free 

trade in this token on exchanges.

The GMP token is issued exclusively in 

exchange for �at currency coming into the SRG 

in the amounts necessary for payments under 

the referral program, which is allocated 30% of 

the SRG proceeds. 

Thus, for every USD 100 that comes into the 

SRG community , 300 GMPs are released. All 

GMP tokens of the system are guaranteed by 

liquid �at currency. The liquidity level always 

corresponds to 100% of the tokens in 

circulation, which ensures that the SRG can 

redeem the GMP at any time at the request of 

the holder. 

GMPs bought out by SRG from referrers for ETH 

are burned.

In order to convert GMPs to ETH, the referrer 

must already have an open wallet supporting 

ETH transactions. The address of this wallet 

should be indicated in the personal wallet of 

the referrer in the SRG community . There it is 

necessary to create an application for the 

transfer of GMPs to ETH and send to the 

address of the company as many GMPs as 

needed to be exchanged. Upon receipt of the 

application, the repurchase will be performed, 

the GMPs received from the referrer will be 

burned, and the referrer will get the equivalent 

of this amount in ETH for his personal wallet.

For game developers, a personal cabinet will be 

created, through which they will receive 

reports and statistics, and we will be able to get 

information about payments and referrals that 

came from our referrers. All money transfers 

from developers will be carried out through a 

personal wallet in a �at currency.



The SRG Community will earn money from commissions received from developers. There will be 

two main types of rewards:

For attracting new players. Receipt of funds is in 

national currency.

For in-game purchases made by referred 

players. Receipt of funds is in national currency 

and GMP

12SRG Comunity



4SRG Comunity

Let’s consider separately the cases of receiving remuneration

in national currency and GMP:

SITUATION 1

Purchase of in-game items in mobile games
(payment in national currency):

1. The developer embeds the SRG community 

module into the game.

2. Players (referrers) attract other players 

(referrals) into the game.

3. Referrals make purchases in the game in their 

national currency.

4. The SRG community service tracks purchases 

in the game.

5. The money for purchases goes to the App 

Store or Play Market.

6. The App Store or Play Market transfers 85%* 

of the purchase to the game developer in the 

�at currency, convenient for the developer.

7. Immediately after the purchase, SRG 

community sends the game developer an 

invoice in his personal wallet. The invoice is 

50% of the money received by the developer 

after deducting the 15%* commission from the 

App Store or Play Market placement service.

8. The developer pays SRG community on the 

invoice, which covers:

30% for remunerating referrers

70% is income of SRG

9. The money is sent to the SRG community 

bank account.

SITUATION 2

Purchase of in-game items by referrers
in mobile games (payment in GMP):

1. The developer embeds the SRG community 

module into the game.

2. Players (referrers) attract other players 

(referrals) into the game.

3. Referrers receive a reward in GMPs for 

attracting referrals and their in-game purchases.

4. Referrers make in-app purchases in GMP.

5. GMPs are sent to a separate SRG community 

account. 

6. SRG community pays the developer 50% of 

the spent GMPs in the local currency, convenient 

for the developer. The money for developer 

payments is taken from the liquidity pool, and 

the equivalent in GMP is burned.

7. The remaining 50% of GMP is the total pro�t.

8. Distribution of total pro�t:

30% of GMP tokens are returned to the 

referral system 

35% of the tokens go to the

SRG community.

35% of the tokens are the net pro�t of SRG 

community  and distributed subsequently 

between token holdings.

Let’s consider this business model in the following
short example of a series of transactions:

First payment: 200 USD (the referral bought 

in-game items in a national currency)

1. 100$ — game developers;

2. 30$ — referrers (30 USD goes into liquidity, 

and the referrer receives 300 GMPs);

3. 35$ — SRG Community;

4. 35$ — token holders (left for conversion to 

Ethereum and further payments).

Balance for distribution: 35$

Liquidity: 30$ 

Tokens on the market: 300 GMP

Reverse buy-out (referrer wants to convert GMP 

to ETH): 150 GMP

1. 15$ — referrer (receives the equivalent of 

USD 15 in ETH at the current exchange rate);

2. 150 GMP — burned;

Balance for distribution: 35$

Liquidity: 15$

Tokens on the market: 150 GMP

All calculations assume that the App Store or Play Market has 

already received its commissions. 

15SRG Comunity



Thus, if at this moment another payment is made to the token holders, the pro�t 

for the distribution is: 120 USD.

Second payment: 400 USD (the referral bought 

in-game items in a national currency)

1. 200$ — game developers

2. 60$ — referrer (USD 60 goes into liquidity, 

and referrer gets 600 GMPs)

3. 70$ — SRG Community;

4. 70$ — token holders (left for conversion to 

Ethereum and further payments).

Balance for distribution: 105$

Liquidity: 75$

Tokens on the market: 750 GMP

Third payment: 600 GMPs (referrer bought 

in-game items in GMPs)

1. 300 GMP — game developers (developers 

get 30 USD), 300 GMPs are bought out by the 

SRG Community with the liquidity fund and are 

burned.

2. 150 GMP — SRG Community;

3. 0 GMP — referrer (in this case, the referrer 

that bought in-game items was not a 

higher-level referrer, otherwise 30% of the GMP 

would go to him or her)

4. 150 GMP — token holders (we buy out GMPs 

with the liquidity fund, tokens are burned, USD 

15 goes to the balance for converting to ETH 

and further payments).

Balance for distribution: 120$

Liquidity: 30$

Tokens on the market: 300 GMP

Distribution of dividends
The dividend distribution process occurs in two 

stages: obtaining accurate data on the 

distribution of SRG tokens among token 

holders (the dividend report) and distribution 

of the company’s pro�t among the owners of 

the tokens. 

Report on dividends
To form a list of accounts for calculating 

dividends, the SRG Community will take a 

snapshot of the blockchain before each 

dividend distribution. This permits �xing the 

current distribution of tokens among token 

holders at the time of the selected block. The 

number of this key unit and the time of its 

appearance will be announced in advance on 

the SRG Community site. 

Payment of dividends and exchange
At the moment, the exchanges do not support 

the correct accrual of token dividends, so at the 

time of dividend calculation, the tokens must 

be in your personal wallet. The SRG Community 

is currently negotiating with the largest 

exchanges about the introduction of the 

functionality for receiving dividends and will 

notify customers as soon as this opportunity is 

available at any of the exchanges.

Ethereum smart contract
The smart contract for dividend distribution is 

designed to distribute pro�ts among token 

holders in accordance with their shares. All 

payments will be made in ETH. Dividends will 

be sent to the addresses that own SRG tokens, 

as con�rmed by the blockchain snapshot.

The SRG Community will transfer USD 50 of the company’s net pro�t for the purchase of ether. It will 

be sent to pay the token holders using the Ethereum smart contract. The dividend distribution date 

will be announced in advance on the SRG Community website. To receive their share of dividends, 

the token holders must store them in ERC20 compatible wallets that support dividend payment. A 

list of such wallets, in addition to the basic charging wallet, will be announced on the SRG 

Community website.

Key Features of the Project

Advantages for players

Creating one’s own business. 

By becoming a partner of the SRG Community, 

the player has the opportunity to build his or 

her own business based on the loyalty 

program. The motivation system will enable the 

creation of a deep client network and give the 

partner a high level of income. At the same 

time, the partner will have all the tools (from 

banners to video clips) for e�ectively 

promoting the referral link and building a 

referral network. This is really the �rst real 

opportunity to play a game and run a business 

at the same time. 

Discounts for premium currency in games.         

As we are in direct contact with the game 

developers, the participants of the SRG system 

have the opportunity to purchase a premium 

currency in any game project, which comes 

with a 30–40% discount in partnership          

with SRG. 

Game bonuses. Gifts and premium services 

from game developers, dependent on 

partnership. Bonuses will be granted not only 

to the referrers, but also to the referred people. 

Once a quarter, the most active referrer will 

receive additional valuable prizes, which will 

also increase the interest in participating in the 

SRG system and add a competitive spirit.

Advantages for game 
developers

Generation of targeted tra�c. Since SRG is a 

point-based CPA network in the online gaming 

world, we will be able to attract targeted 

players through referral programs, thus 

completely eliminating the possibility of bots or 

low-quality tra�c appearing. We know that our 

referrers are interested in acquiring income and 

additional rewards that can only come from a 

targeted and high-quality �ow of referrals.

Budget savings. Thanks to the cooperation with 

SRG, game developers will reduce the costs of 

their advertising campaigns, since the SRG 

module is free and integrated with the 

developer’s application. In the case of a 

partnership, the developer will pay 

commissions from tra�c coming through the 

SRG referral program. The commission is 

30–50% of each player’s purchase, which will go 

to marketing and rewards for the token holders. 

Ultimately, we are switching to a system in 

which the developer �rst receives a target 

payment from the player (for example, through 

the App Store), and only then pays for this 

purchase commissions, thereby saving his 

budget.

Stream of motivated players. With the SRG 

loyalty program, we will be able to launch viral 

marketing into any gaming project to attract a 

stream of motivated customers with the help of 

the original players of the project. There is also 

a natural increase in the number of users due to 

the players of other games who are connected 

to the SRG platform.

Our system will actively develop in all countries where mobile and computer games are popular, 

however, as a priority, our team chose the Asian market for a number of reasons:

Number of installations
China has the largest number of users. The top application on the iPhone there gets 350,000 

installations per day. The largest revenue in Japan is 1 million USD per day on the iPhone with 77,000 

installations and 1.5 million USD on Android with 53,000 installations. 

Amount of money and active assets spent on online games
Users from East Asia (China, Japan, and South Korea) spent 12.7 billion USD on mobile games in 2016. 

The sum of investments is led by Japan: 132 million people spent 6.2 billion USD, which is more than in 

the US, the publication notes. The largest number of users of mobile games in Asia is in China — 785 

million people. They spent 5.2 billion USD on games on iOS and Android in 2016. South Korea rounds 

o� the “big three” with expenditures of 1.3 billion USD.

Positive attitude to cryptocurrency and development of the blockchain
This april the the Japanese authorities adopted a law on virtual currency. Thanks to the new law, the 

country has now legalized Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies. Thus, the cryptocurrency in Japan 

can now be used for mutual settlements. China and Korea are going to do the same 



The average daily time spent on online games is 5 hours
In Asian countries, the governments have recognized the problem of over-enthusiasm for computer 

and mobile games, which is increasing every year. More and more young people prefer computer and 

mobile games to o�ine entertainment and personal meetings with friends. 

Since our platform is a browser-based application, we are approaching

for all categories of PC and Mobile. To date, on beta testing, we use 100-150 mobile games to identify 

bugs and errors. In addition, with our partners RASPP (Chamber of Commerce and Industry of China), 

our team will actively promote the product to the Asian market to form the base of online games.

The forecast of the number of games connected to the SRG system
and the revenue of the SRG Community in a year, depending
on the amount of connected games:

As the SRG token is a pro�t share, its value for 

the token holders directly depends on the 

pro�tability of the SRG Community company. 

Our strategic goal is to connect a large number 

of games to the SRG system, to promote the 

community and build up the client base. 

Therefore, we will ensure a stable growth of the 

company’s pro�ts and consequently an

number of connected games indicated in the table.

increase in the volume of payments to the 

token holders from half-year to half-year. That 

will lead to increased demand for SRG tokens 

because the pro�tability for holders of this 

token will outstrip its competitors.

The forecast of the pro�t distributed among the token holders:

*  Pro�t from ownership of 1 SRG token, assuming that during the ICO all 20 million tokens will be distributed, 

one year after the number of connected games indicated in the table is reached.  All calculations are based on 

the minimum conversions and the average check size for the industry in terms of the player.

This table is calculated on the basis of the most minimal forecast, that by May 2019 through our system will be 

about 1% of all purchases in online games. What data did we use to compile a minimalistic forecast:

Of all the games connected to the SRG Community system, only 10% will be registered in our system.

Of these, 5% percent are players spending $ 20 a year (average market data at the time of the survey).

Of the connected players, only 20% will be able to attract new players steadily, on average 3 attracted people per 

month will be attracted to each attracting person. Of the newly attracted people, the conversion to the paying 

player spending an average of $ 20 per year on the game is still the same 5%. A 15% payment to the aggregators 

of mobile applications from Apple and Google is also taken into account. Although mobile games will be only 

part of our connected games, and for games on PCs and consoles, such commissions are either not present, or 

they are smaller. Thus, as you can see, the income of the company and your income can be much higher, since 

the current calculations were made based on the most minimal forecasts.
