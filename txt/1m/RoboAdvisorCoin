Most of the time, customers do not get the financial advice they need but rather the 

advice their advisor thinks they need, based on i) a desire not to deviate too far from 

conventional wisdom and ii) a desire to maximise the potential to sell products to them. 

This conflicted situation arises so often that an intelligent user can never really know 

which human generated advice they can really trust.  

Now, imagine a world in which all financial advice received was neutral, honest and 

immune from manipulationor influenced by human biases and beliefs.  

That’s the exciting new world of opportunities which theRoboAdvisorCoin project 

represents.

1. Fintech, Artificial Intelligence and Crypto-currencies 

The explosive growth currently underway within the Fintech industry is 

revolutionizing financial markets generally and the role of intermediaries more 

specifically. Historically, financial markets have been organized around trusted third 

parties, i.e. intermediaries, authorized to perform specific tasks on behalf of clients. 

Prominent examples are brokers, banks, dealers, underwriters, analysts and 

consultants. Although the role of these intermediaries might not necessarily be 

centralized, the functioning of the market itself is often concentrated around few key 

players such as clearing houses, exchanges, and major investment banks. More 

specifically, although the design of a financial decision could be made at the 

periphery of the market place, its execution is often a prerogative of a centralized 

structure.  

With the massive expansion of cloud computing, machine learning, artificial 

intelligence (AI henceforth), and information technologies more generally, the current 

financial markets structure is very likely heading towards a brutal reality check. Two 

trends haveclearly emergedover the past few years: first, AI is playing an ever-

increasing role in the analysis ofbig data in the form of consumption choices, surveys, 

and financial transactions.The analysis of big data through AI opens unexplored 

possibilities in terms of the analysis of market trends, forecasting, and the design of 

predictive systems for risk management and asset allocation purposes.Second, peer-

to-peer exchanges and clearing systems, based on blockchain technologies,will 

increasingly have the ability to render obsolete the role of financial intermediaries and 

trusted third parties,making the whole market structure decentralized and subject to 

the multiple, contemporaneous, control from market participants.  

In this context, Robo-Advisory plays an increasing relevant role at the 

intersection between decentralized peer-to-peer relationships, high-quality bespoke 

financial advice, and on-demand real-time analysis of large financial data sets. The 

“on-demand” feature of Robo-Advisory is a key advantage; the ability for large-scale 



 

 

9 
 

 

fast computing algorithms to provide a wide range of complex quantitative analytics 

and forecasts, at a fraction of standard costs, is likely to see a sustained rise in this 

type of research and advice at the expense of human-based research generation. In 

due course it is entirely feasible that humans will resort entirely on AI-generated 

market research. This will likely prove to be a very disruptive trend in what has been, 

up to now, something of a cosy cartel for investment banks and associated market 

participants. 

Because of the massive improvement of peer-to-peer exchanges and 

blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies (Cryptos henceforth) are emerging as a 

significant component of financial markets; in this respect, Cryptos are now becoming 

a well-defined asset class which has its own dynamics, risks, and peculiarities. To put 

things in perspective, the total market capitalization of all issued and traded digital 

currencies has already reacheda level of around US$150 Billion, and continues to 

increase on an almost daily basis.Cryptos such as Bitcoin are being consideredby 

manyusers and market participants asa viable and increasingly accepted method of 

payment. 

It is evident that, given the widespread diffusion of Cryptos, the need for 

accurate and timely advice in relation to these new products is certain to increase 

significantly soon.  

In this context RAC (Robo Advisor Coin) has the ability to become the ideal 

accelerator of a disruptive market technology empowering users with timely and 

accurate Crypto-related information. 

The RAC platform can provide unique Crypto indexes, forecasts, research, 

statistics and relevant news items on this exciting and growing asset class. In the 

medium-term, the Company also aims to provide a number of educational services 

aimed at improving the financial acumen of its users, through the use of fun and 

competitive applications. For instance, with the service named Beat the Bot, users will 



 

 

10 
 

 

be able to test their financial knowledge and compete with the Robo to forecast 

financial returns on a broad class of Cryptos.  

2. Robo-Advisory: A Rapidly Emerging Market Sector 

Robo-advisors generally use proprietary software to produce market forecasts 

and securities analyses. They first appeared in the U.S. in theaftermath of the 

financial crisis of 2008/2009. Following their successful implementation in the U.S., 

they have been adopted in Europe and Asia, where this new technology hasgrown 

rapidly to become an increasingly important part of the financial services industry. At 

the time of writing, there are only a small number of fully-automatized Robo-Advisors 

which have been set-upand developed in Europe offering bespoke solutions for the 

prediction of market trends. The sector evolution can be outlined in four main steps 

(see Figure 1): 

 

Step 1: Online platforms available to userswhich, to a degree, reduce the extent of human 

relationships. In this case the human component is still present and the use of the 

technology is aimed at limiting the interaction between the customer and the consultant. 

Passive allocation strategies such as ETFs are typically implemented. 

 

Step 2: In addition to helping mitigate human interaction, the Robo-advisor is capable of 

providing the necessary information for customers to adjust their portfolios as required.  

Again, the technology involved is mostly, if not totally, concentrated around the provision 

of a user-friendly web platform that allows customers to follows their portfolios.  

 

Step 3: A new generation of Robo-advisors provide customers (in addition to the above) 

with the possibility to make use of algorithms and optimise their portfolios and exploit 

pre-determined rules which are typically the result of the decisions of a human-based 

investment committee. The technological content in this case goes beyond the simple 



 

 

11 
 

 

design of the web platform and allows investors to complement their beliefs and 

intuitions with the input provided by Robo-based-advice. 

 

Step 4: The last step in the evolution of Robo-advisors consists in the full automatisation 

of market analysis and financial advice. In this case, the human role is limited to the 

supervision, improvement and monitoring of the algorithmic predictive system. Unlike the 

first three steps, AI is heavily utilized for the design and implementation of large-scale on-

demand predictive frameworks. 

 

 

Figure 1 - The evolution of Digital Wealth Management Services. 

It is evident that Robo-advisors are changing the interaction between 

customers and their financial consultants and intermediaries.The market share of 

machine-based advisory is expected to grow in the U.S. by 29% per year between now 

and 2021.Such growth is not limited to the U.S. and, indeed, Chinese customersare 

expected to increase from 2mln to more than 70mln over the same period. This 

market analysis by AT Kearney consulting states that Robo-advisors will be managing 

U.S. $2.2tln of assets within five years, which represents a 68% annual growth rate. 

 



 

 

12 
 

 

 

Figure 2 - Total PotentialMarket. 

Similarly, BI Intelligence, Business Insider's research service, suggests that 

Robo-advisors will manage approximately 9% of all global assets under management 

(AUM) by 2020 (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). This would be equal to approximately 

US$8tln.  

Robo-advisors currently follow any of the following three distinct operational 

models:  

 

Type 1: Standalone companies that use algorithms to recommend stocks and manage 

portfolios.  

 

Type 2: Hybrid Robo-advisors which combine automatized recommendations with on-

demand interaction with customers and business advisors.   

 

Type 3: Finally, advanced standalone companies that use more complex algorithms to 

create and actively manage portfolios, possibly using optimal allocation strategies (Step 

4 above)

Figure 3 - Market projections for Robo-advisory. 

 

MyPrivateBanking estimates that by 2020, Robo-advisory services will grow to 

US$2tlnin the U.S. alonewith the total market size expected to increase to US$7tln by 

2025 (see Figure 3).

According to EY, the worldwide target market shows that: 

 

 Transaction Value in the "Fintech" market amounts to US$3.3 Billion per 

yeartodate. 

 Transaction Value is expected to show an annualised growth rate (CAGR 2017-

2021) of 20.5 % resulting in a total amount of market turnover of US$6.9 

Billionby 2021. 

 The market's largest segment is in "Digital Payments", with a total transaction 

value of US$2.6 Billion year-to-date. 

 From a global comparison perspective,we notice that the highest transaction 

value is in China (US$1.08 Billion year-to-date).  

 The Middle East and North Africa are two interesting areas for growth 

inFintech. In fact,for example, the MENA regionhas a populationof circa 

250mln people, 60% of whom arebelow 25 years of age and whereby internet 

users amount to more than 155 mln. 

 

 

2.1. RoboAdvisorCoinand real market needs 

 

Accurate and timely financial statistics and information are something which are 

normally available only to specialized customers, analysts and professional market 

participants.  

Imagine what would happen if there were the possibility to obtain reliable 

forecasts and market analyses at a fraction of the standard costs and which was 

available anytime investors needed it, without costly intermediations. This is exactly what 

the RoboAdvisorCoin project aims at offering. In fact, the on-demand aspect and the 

absence of costly interactions are at the core of the envisasged business model. 

The widespread diffusion of the internet and smartphones both in developed and 

emerging markets, together with a higher propensity to engage in safe disintermediated 



 

 

15 
 

 

transactions, makes the perfect case for using a trustworthy platform in order to 

obtaincheap and specialized financial services and objective advice. Without doubt, the 

latter will be an irreversible trend of modern financial markets driven bythe increasing 

tendency to lower fees and costs. Indeed, it is rather clear that even the most skilled 

human advisor cannot cope with the need to cheaply, quickly, and accuratelyprovide 

hundreds, if not thousands, of possible predictions, advice and scenarios, not to mention 

identification of risk exposures, hedging strategies, and future paths across different 

market states and cycles. 

The increasing need of more personalized, efficient and reliable information 

platforms which are a credible alternative to human advisors is already clear. In a 

research document, which was intended to address the propensity for wealth 

management consumers to use digital solutions, Deloitte asked 2,700 respondents across 

market segments, age groups, genders, and geographical areas about their desire for 

digital interaction (via app, mobile, and web) with their wealth manager (current or 

prospective). Based on the results obtained, they constructed a “Digital Propensity” score, 

which measure how much, and often, an individual or market segment would prefer to 

engage with a wealth manager via its digital channels rather than via traditional face-to-

face or phone channels. The survey results strongly suggest that the Mass Market and 

Mass Affluent segments were more open to the use of digital tools being applied by their 

wealth manager or advisor than more affluent customers (see Figure 4) 

 



 

 

16 
 

 

Figure 5–Needs and preferences by Wealth Tiers. 

 

More specifically, the research showed that the Mass Market segment is 

arguably the most prone to digital engagement, meaning they are ready to be contacted 

by an advisor via mobile app and have the lowest need for control and lowest tolerance 

for complex financial decision making. Similarly, the Mass Affluent segment is also prone 

to engage in digital opportunities, with their highest priority placed on enrolment in new 

digital products. This is coupled witha low tolerance for addressing complex financial 

decisions, such as, e.g., retirement planning.Finally, the research also showed that the 

High Net Worth and Ultra High Net Worth segments are the least ready for the digital shift. 

Much of their hesitance turned out to be the consequence of a generalized desire of 

having a high-touch engagementwith their advisor, as well as their desire to have face-to-

face meetings regularly. 

 The Deloitte analysis referred to above confirmed that large market segments 

view the use of AI and new technologies favourably and as a means to improve efficiency 

and control over their financial decisions. Despite few nuances, a large chunk of potential 

customers, regardless of age or net wealth/income, want enhanced digital capabilities. 

RAC aims at satisfying those needs by providing a reliable platform which makes use of 

cutting edge AI technologies.

2.2. Why Robo-Advisors Can be Useful 

 

 

Figure 6 - Robo-Advisor Potential Implementations. 

 

As pointed out by Accenture Research (see Figure 5 above), most of the existing 

platforms use simple questionnaires to profile customers and to assess their needs and 

attitude towards risk. An asset allocation model is then proposed, adjusted and 

implemented, and the resulting portfolios are monitored and rebalanced if need be. 

 

Current technological advances streamline both the account opening processand 

theability to transfer assets. However, this represents a modest improvement which, in 

alllikelihood, will not meet the increasingly complex needs of users and certainly will not 

exploit the increasing capabilities offered by AI and machine learning. 

 

The areas in which Robo-advisors can supplement, if not substitute, traditional advisors 

are many (see Figure 5 for a summary), and can be summarized as follows: 

 



 

 

18 
 

 

1. Financial Advisory – This is the obvious first candidate. Providing assistance 

tocustomersinconstructingbespoke portfolios based on their respective risk 

appetites and time horizons is a crucial aspect in which unbiased and timely AI 

advice can make a difference.  

 

2. Retirement Planning – Retirement planning is another obvious function of a 

customers’ personal financial journey and one that lends itself to automation. From 

a Private Affluent/HNW standpoint, there is a need to provide complex retirement 

services while balancing tax optimisation, income streams and estate planning, inter 

alia. Robo-advisors can bring in market trends and movements to ensure that client’s 

retirement holdings are not skewed towardsspecific sectors of the market. 

 

3. Tax Planning – Robo-advisors can help customers in managing their wealth whilst 

optimising the impact of taxation. The ability to achieve the right mix of assets from 

a tax perspective is a key capability and one that can be automated to a high degree. 

 

4. Insurance Management – Insurance is another key feature which can be 

automatized to a certain extent. A Robo-advisor can help suggest and manage the 

typesof insurance purchased by each respectivecustomerfor hedging purposes. 

 

Currently, most Robo-advisors are focused on providing portfolio management 

services by rebalancing and optimising allocations without addressing issues such as 

retirement planning, tax optimisation and cash-flow management, which are also critical 

domains of financial planning. In this respect, it is virtually certain that competition, 

innovation and new technology will dramatically increase the role of Robo-advisors in the 

immediate future. Future versions will need to consider the client’s complexities by 

adapting questions based on earlier responses. In developing appropriate financial plans, 

Robo-advisors can assimilate multiple goals, including college savings, planned home 

purchases, retirement, protection needs, and the need for health care and/ or long-term 

care coverage. In proposing solutions, they will be able to incorporate outside assets, 



 

 

19 
 

 

handle individual securities, ladder bond portfolios, consider low tax basis holdings, and 

allocate around illiquid positions. They will help users understand their portfolios by 

providing information and learning in the context of the financial results and market 

information being presented.  

 

Other areas of the Robo-advisory domain which are of interest to customers include 

the privacy offered by the said digital solution coupled with an advanced cognitive abilityIt 

is envisaged that, over the next decade and beyond, emerging technologies, such as 

cognitive computing, will power major advances in Robo-advisory capabilities.  

 

2.3. Positioning the RAC Project 

The RAC platform, launched by SteadyWealth, is a concept at the interplay between big 

data and machine learning, which provides large-scale multi-asset quantitative analysis, 

covering over 80,000 securities in more than 30 countries, including all major global 

exchanges.  

The Company has opted, for the initial phase of the Robo-advisor 

implementation, to position itsRobo-advisory platform in a market niche which relates to 

the production of original forecasts, statistics, and quantitative research broadly speaking, 

as a means of support for the financial decision-making process of our customers. The 

Company believes that this is a market with immense potential given the increasing 

necessity for customers to acquire timely and accurate analysis and unbiased information 

to operate in a fully informed way in an increasingly competitive global financial 

environment. Cryptos are no exception. In fact, that Company plans to invest in both the 

technology and the delivery of cutting-edge analyses and forecasts for the entire Crypto 

universe. Thus, the Company also intends to feature the construction of benchmark 

indexes which information, customers may use in the construction of strategies and 

performance evaluation more generally.  



 

 

20 
 

 

In this respect, the Company does not intend to position its Robo-advisor as an 

investment manager of financial intermediary. Instead, it aims at the provision of timely, 

accurate and cost effective investment research reports produced by AI-powered 

software. Thus, its main goal for the initial phase is to provide an outstanding low-cost, 

personalized, tool that generates timely and accurate daily forecasts and data reports on 

the financial markets. This positions the RAC platform as a unique and distinctive product 

in the landscape of the Robo-advisory industry. The Company’s primary focus is to 

organize and manage an original supply of services with a competitive price-to-quality 

ratio. 

Therefore, SteadyWealth will concentrate its offer as an independent producer of 

original and differentiated quantitative research reports. This is a key point, as the market 

of potential users spans from private users to small companies which might not have an 

army of in-house quantitative analysts and researchers.  

The Company believes that adequate safeguards have been taken in ensuring the 

precision and independence of its software. In fact, team members do not receive any 

performance-related cash bonuses or rewards from the sale of some product rather than 

other.  

Therefore, the major distinctive features of the RAC platform can be summarized as 

follows: 

- Simplicity and ease of use: Our priority is to deliver a simple, intuitive, and profitable 

experience for our subscribers. This is particularly important as not all customers are 

necessarily experts in financial markets. A clear and intuitive platform which delivers what 

investors need on the basis of simple operations is a key advantage. In this respect, the 

financial literacy tools we aim to introduce alongside the quantitative analytics will be 

implemented with the intention of providing users with not only the forecasts and reports, 

but also some basic pedagogic tools in order to better understand those forecasts and 

analysis.  

 



 

 

21 
 

 

- Large scale adaptive forecasts: We implement advanced AI technologies to produce 

forecasts and analyses for a large set of markets across countries, sectors and securities. 

Our methodology is adaptive, which means that the AI adapts in real time to market 

changes and cycles in producing trend analysis, predictions and recommendations.The 

ability of the modelling framework to capture trends and scenarios is constantly 

monitored by our in-house experts to ensure that we employ the most up-to-date 

methodology in the market. In this respect, we benefit from constant interaction with 

leading academics in the field of financial econometrics. The accuracy of the forecasts 

and risk measures is constantly monitored so that our team can promptly intervene in 

case of market anomalies or structural changes in the model dynamics. All of this is made 

within a big data framework in which thousands of Cryptos and securities are jointly 

monitored daily.  

 

- On demand reports: An important distinctive feature of our platform is the production of 

personalized, on-demand, financial reports with advanced quantitative analytics and 

predictions about virtually every security monitored. This represents a key distinction with 

respect to our competitors which normally provide clients with pre-conceived strategies 

and methodologies, but rarely provide customers with the information needed to 

implement informed decisions in full autonomy. Reports are produced by using machine 

learning tools, which are then translated into usable content. Consistent with an extensive 

academic literature, in synthesising the software at the basis of the Robo-advisor, it was 

noted that the web-crawling procedure used tends to provide more timely information on 

key anomalous events such as Brexit, and possibly allows anticipating profitable market 

trends.  

 

- Unique financial universe: Thanks to the breadth of data analysed,daily forecasts and 

reports cover a widespread universe that is unique in its category. In addition, the ability to 

navigate between various markets and to query the list of the best forecasts generated for 

each major financial market, allows the user to obtain security-specific information in a 

timely fashion for tens of thousands of assets listed in more than 30 countries. This is 



 

 

22 
 

 

made possible by the widespread, scalable and complex analysis on each financial 

instrument traded which is populated in the database.The database on prices, volumes 

and other key financial indicators is updated daily and with up to ten years of historical 

data on record. 

The Company believes that the range of solutions and applications outlined 

above shows the various strengths which allow the RoboAdvisorCoin platform to have a 

competitive advantage with respect to most, if not all, of its market competitors. The 

Company is strongly committed to constantly improve and update both its technology and 

database in order to provide clients with an even more precise and wide set of choices 

and analytics. 

  



 

 

23 
 

 

2.4. Vision and Mission 

In recent years, markets have become increasingly reliantupon the support of 

central banks. This dependence on constant stimuli (through the likes of QE) means 

that markets have become less volatile and therefore it is increasingly harder for 

investors to identify secondary or tertiary trends as well as individual stock, currency 

or credit opportunities.Political turmoil across Europe and the U.S., widespread 

uncertainty, loose monetary policies by major central banks and the risk of sovereign 

defaults makes it virtually impossible to systematically beat the market by 

anticipating lasting trends and profitable strategies. Thus, it is not a coincidence that 

most asset managers have been struggling to generate good returns these days, 

almost never beating their chosen benchmarks. With a pioneers’ spirit SteadyWealth 

founding team decided to exploit the power of AI advances in order to provide the 

technological tools required to support decision making processes. 

Our vision has always been to provide users with more accurate financial 

forecasts, which through an innovative use the Company’s systems is able to provide 

timely, accurate and actionable data all atan affordable price. To some extent, our 

vision is very simple to explain: we believe RoboAdvisorCoin technology is one of the 

leading Robo-advisory engines, created to support an active strategy with a total 

return target, conditional on the user’s risk preferences and exploit recent advanced 

AI infrastructures to guarantee an optimal risk-return trade off. The use of such 

technology, coupled with a massive database which includes the current Crypto 

universe, makes SteadyWealth a market leader in the Robo-advisory sector, with a set 

of strength which span from cutting-edge AI engines, spanning from the production of 

daily forecasts and analytics, to a deep database which covers tens of thousands of 

securities across more than thirty countries, to finish with a proven track record 

generated across simulated portfolios. Our mission is to create a large-scale 

forecasting tool for global securities and Cryptos based on advanced AI 

methodologies, with the goal to generate accurate and timely reports for private users 

and small businesses.  



 

 

24 
 

 

3. Our Services 

RoboAdvisorCoin aims to become unique amongst Robo-advisors by focusing 

on the provision of a broad range of financial research reports based on the analytics 

produced by its algorithms for a large set of Cryptos and securities across different 

exchanges. In this sense, the main goal of SteadyWealth is to create a platform which 

allows users to collect, elaborate, navigate and utilize big data related to global 

financial assets including Cryptos and tokens.  

The underlying platform was initially launched to provide B2C services to users 

based in the Italian market. This phase can be considered as the initial “beta testing” 

environment of our Robo-advisory platform in a real-life context, with the specific goal 

of collecting all user feedback and expectations to tailor the services to real user 

needs. During thisfirst period of activity, we noticed an increasing interest in the 

platform, which was confirmed by the growing trend of user registrations andby the 

positive feedback we constantly received, which clearly reflected a widespread 

interest in customized research produced by Robo-advisory firms.  

Initial services included the possibility for users to obtain detailed forecasts 

and analytics for single securities, to generate their own virtual portfolios, to perform 

back-tests on chosen portfolios, to optimize and rebalance the portfoliosdepending 

on market conditions and cycles, as well as to receive targeted up-to-date reports. At 

present, customers of more traditional banks or research providers tend to get reports 

generated by humans which are not only subject to the cognitive biases of their 

authors, but which are sometimes produced solely in order to support some 

investment banking or capital-raising activity.  

 

One of the principal aims of our RoboAdvisorCoin services is to address these 

potential conflicts by providing objective, automatized reports which are generated 

without direct interventions by humans, and therefore without being affected by 

emotions, biases, and personal incentives mentioned above. 

 



 

 

25 
 

 

The objectivity of RoboAdvisorCoin platform is guaranteed by the exclusive use 

of AI algorithms to produce forecasts, research, news reports and services on around 

80,000 global securities in addition to the Crypto universe. Human interaction only 

occurs to make sure that the predictive algorithms are functioning properly. Within the 

community of RAC tokens owners, the RoboAdvisorCoin platform will offer many 

exclusive services. First, holders of RAC tokens will receive daily forecasts on the 

Crypto universe. Second, Crypto-Indexes and personalized analytics will be provided 

to the users, thus enabling the user to request the AI to perform elaborations on-

demand to meet his/her specific needs. Third, and as a very distinguishing feature, 

the services provided by SteadyWealth in this area will create a viral footprint 

amongst customers in this space by providing access to financial literacy oriented 

gaming such as the Beat the Bot and the Robo-Race services which are described in 

more details the next Sections.  

  



 

 

26 
 

 

3.1. Cost of the Service 

RoboAdvisorCoin services will be payable through a monthly subscription of €20. It is 

envisaged that the monthly subscription fee will increase upon the introduction of 

each additional service.  

 

After the closing day of the ICO, RAC token holders will be ableto access services in 

exchange for RAC tokens. The number of RAC tokens needed to access any given 

service will stay fixed for a period of four years and will include any service that 

SteadyWealth will launch or create during the same period.  

 

The use of RAC tokens to access the services will therefore result in very 

advantageous terms in the sense that contributing the equivalent value of 1 month 

subscription during the ICO will result in holding enough tokens for a 2 month 

subscription.  

 

The forecasting services will be exclusively available in exchange for RAC tokens. 

 

 

 

 

  



 

 

27 
 

 

3.2. Services Details 

The following Sections describe some featured services that will be realized in the 

event of a successful ICO launch. 

 

3.2.1. Forecasts, Personalized Statistics and Crypto 

Analytics 

 

Our existing daily service that offers specific and updated forecasts on tens of 

thousands of securities over more than 30 countries and across different asset 

classes will be tuned to analyze Cryptos. Each Crypto will be analyzed daily by our AI 

platform to produce a specific forecast for different time horizons. These predictions 

will be inserted in specific reports. 

 

The reports generated will be easy and simple to read and the analysis 

included will be broken down into three key areas:  

1) historical performances, e.g. past week and month returns;  

2) future expected performance;  

3) specific risk analytics, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) 

and several performance ratios such as the Sharpe Ratio.  

 

For each Crypto, the RoboAdvisorCoin platform produces at least a daily 

research report that gives the possibility to the users to independently and 

autonomously decide what to do with theforecasts produced by the platform.  

 

Figure7 reproduces an example of the daily report focusing on Cryptos and 

tokens that will be available to RACtoken holders. Columns may represent, 

respectively,(1) the name of the Crypto under analysis, (2) the return achieved during 

the last week, (3) the return achieved during the last month, (4) the probability of the 

Crypto to rise in the next 30 days with the corresponding expected return (5). For 



 

 

28 
 

 

instance, the following report indicates that KoreCoin has a 60% probability of rising 

another 70% over the next month. 

 

In our roadmap, the Crypto forecasts reports will be reached through Milestone 1.

1We remark that past performance is not an indication of future performance and that our forecasts are 
not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the customer 
enablement, access or use of any estimated provided by the report.

Figure 8 shows another sample of daily report, in this case related to the UK stock 

market.

2We remark that past performance is not an indication of future performance and that our forecasts are 
not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the customer 
enablement, access or use of any estimated provided by the report. 



 

 

30 
 

 

3.2.2. Crypto Indexes 

The RoboAdvisorCoin platform will produce original indexes on Cryptos in order to 

provide customers with a reliable representation of the market trends and 

developments. All Cryptos that provide real-time and reliable data on prices, 

emissions and volumes, will form the universe from which the new Crypto Indexes will 

be constructed. The Index will track all changes in market valuations and traded 

volumes over time. To keep up with the constant developmentsinthe Crypto market, 

the composition of the Crypto Index will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure a 

transparent and up-to-date basket of Cryptos. Our Team will constantly monitor the 

processing of the index calculation rules to ensure the validity of the methodology 

and its consistency with market trends. We will also conduct a general revision and 

audit of the review process on a periodic basis, to reflect the structural changes in the 

Crypto market in addition to all regulatory developments. Because of this constant 

monitoring, our team might be obliged to introduce changes to the Index construction 

methodology; these changes will be made public and notified to subscribers through 

the usual communication channels (e.g. web site, mailing list, etc.). Further ad-hoc 

clarifications will also be added depending on the circumstances. A detailed history of 

the changes in the index calculation and composition will always be available on the 

RoboAdvisorCoin website.  

 

3.2.3. Crypto Robo-Race and educational services 

 

RoboAdvisorCoin aims to develop innovative educational services to improve 

and enhance levels of customers’ knowledge on various asset classes andCryptos.  

 

One of these services will be “Robo-Race”which will offer each user with the 

opportunity to compose a virtual portfolio, containing virtual simulated positions.  

 



 

 

31 
 

 

In this context, we can define a simulated Robo-portfolio as the theoretical 

result of a simulated asset allocation made by our AI algorithms.  

 

The idea is to compare the performance of the virtual portfolios of the 

customers with the Robo-portfolios generated by our Robo-advisor. By means of the 

Robo-Race service each individual subscriber can follow the performances of all self-

generated or auto-generated portfolios to track the virtual returns on the Robo-Race. 

The ranking of the best performer will be published every month on the 

RoboAdvisorCoin website. The customer that wins the Robo-Race with his/her virtual 

portfolio will be eligible for a service discount. 

 

Our goal is that, by taking part in the competition, users (both actual or 

potential)get a more in-depth understanding of how different financial markets work 

as well as how best to use the reports generated by our platform to learn more about 

Crypto trends. 

 

Another educational experience offered by our platform will be called Beat the 

Bot, which provides subscribers with the opportunity to test their own forecasts 

against those generated by our AI platform. The competition can be played in 

different ways, including challenging the Robo-advisor on Cryptos. The subscriber can 

choose a simulated portfolio composed of stocks from a given Index, for e.g. 

FTSE100. The subscriber can then choose as many or as few shares as desired as 

long as the total weighting adds up to 100%. The subscriber submits the chosen 

portfolio by midnight on the Sunday preceding “Game Week”. The Robo will produce 

its best theoretical portfolio before the respective market opens on Monday morning. 

Once the markets have closed on the Friday at the end of “Game Week” the respective 

simulated performance of all portfolios submitted to the competition will be reviewed 

and the portfolio with the highest total return will be awarded. 

  



 

 

32 
 

 

Another variant of the game, which focuses on Cryptos, will allow users to 

choose up to five different Cryptos (weightings at their choice) to compete against a 

portfolio selected by the Robo-advisor. Each user can choose up to five different 

Cryptosbetting against Robo-forecasts on the same currency. If at least three human 

forecasts are better than Robot one, the Robot loses the game and must return the 

token to the user. This means that the forecast made by the Robot was wrong and our 

artificial intelligence will use this information to learn and improve itself. 

3.2.4. Crypto Exchange Cost Comparison 

The platform will represent a unique source of information on Cryptos and 

tokens for customers and subscribers. More specifically, the platform will integrate 

the information published by crypto-exchangesand/or crypto-trading platformson 

prices and spreads; information which is then updated throughout the day to give 

customers a unique trading tool on crypto-currencies and tokens. In this respect, 

show the best prices or spreads available on the market at any given time.  

 

Such role of information provision is coupled with a set of forecasts and 

statistics which are provided as a support of the clients’ decision process. Indeed, 

RoboAdvisorCoin will act not only as an information provider on the most convenient 

exchange, but also as an active advisory tool which provides timely and accurate 

analysis on the chosen Crypto such as, for example, predictions on future trends and 

peer-group analysis based on cross-currency or cross-token correlations.  

 

We remark that the customer will be executing his or her independently taken 

trading decision process, totally outside RoboAdvisorCoin, since our platform is not a 

trading platform nor an investment manager. 

 

It is evident that the pure research role of the platform implies that 

SteadyWealth will be not liable for any loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in 



 

 

33 
 

 

connection with the customer access or use of any crypto-exchangeinformation since 

those are third-party data. 

 

3.2.5. Blockchain-Based Services 

The forecasts provided by the RoboAdvisorCoin platform in Milestone 3 will be 

stored into the Blockchain. The latter provides a shared, immutable, and transparent 

database concerning the history of all the forecasts and analysis generated by our 

Robo-advisor. We believe that the possibility of storing a shared and transparent 

library of predictions and analysis represents a unique opportunity to develop a 

secure and trustworthyRobo-advisor.  

 

In this respect, anyone will be able to check that predictions have not been 

altered,such that the accuracy of every outcome of the platform can be subject to 

public scrutiny. The secure ledger containing the forecasts will be made available to 

the public since the Ethereum Blockchain will be used for the actual realization, 

although the final choice and precise implementation is at the discretion of our team. 

 

Analogously, Robo-portfolios' rankings will be stored in the Blockchain 

periodically, so that each change in the rank positions will be easily verifiable by any 

user participating in the Robo-Race competition. As for the “Beat the Bot” service, 

human and robot forecasts will be also stored into the Blockchain, consistently with 

the logic that RAC tokens will be reimbursedto the user should the forecasts provided 

the platform are wrong beyondreasonable confidence parameters.  This will be 

implemented through specific Smart Contracts in a way that is completely reliable 

and trustworthy for the user. 

 

The platform embraces the challenge of decentralizing forecasts through the 

Blockchain in order to get real time predictions on trends and features of crypto-

currencies and tokens: this means that every user will be able to run the platform on 



 

 

34 
 

 

demand for processing personalized forecasts and obtain accurate information 

onhis/her personal “play list” of Cryptos and tokens.  

 

The ability to provide on-demand forecasts represents a key building block for 

an innovative tool which will be specifically designed for Miners, with the specific 

intent of delivering a set of analytics to help optimizing their production functions and 

profitability. The logic behind this service is that Miners can process on demand 

predictions for the universe of interest, and couple the knowledge provided by the 

platform with their information on the available production technology to choose what 

Crypto is more profitable to mine at any given time.In the absence of a term structure 

of futures contracts, such on-demand service provided by the platform will certainly 

prove to be crucial information for Miners and market operators. The services 

outlined in this section will be realized with the completion of Milestone 3. 

  



 

 

35 
 

 

4. The Token Mechanism 

The tokens issued during the token launch will be known as the 

RoboAdvisorCoin (also known as RAC or RAC Tokens). This is the only time that 

these tokens can be created, and therefore the total supply of RAC is fixed at launch.  

A total of 4,000,000 RAC Tokens will be created during the ICO.  

The RAC will be ERC20 compliant.   

50% of the initial amount of RAC meaning 2,000,000 will be freely circulating 

and 50% tokens meaning 2,000,000 held in “Treasury”. 

 

The company reserve (“Treasury”) will be set aside as follows:  

i) 800,000 RAC for the co-founders;   

ii) 100,000 RAC to  be distributed among  the employees and  

iii) 100,000 RAC to be distributed among the advisor; 

iv) 1,000,000 RAC for the RoboAdvisorCoin Platform. 

 

RAC will vest every month until fully vested with co-founders, employees and 

advisors. If for any reason a founder, employee or advisor ceases his/her activities 

during the vesting period, all vesting will cease and the RAC issued will be returned to 

the RoboAdvisorCoin platform.  

 

  



 

 

36 
 

 

4.1. Token Launch 

Our goal is to raise a maximum of 100,000 ETH and a minimum of 3,000 ETH.  

 Maximum financing: 100,000 ETH (Hard Cap) 

 Minimum financing:  3,000 ETH (First Cap)  

 Second Cap: 15,000 ETH 

 Exchange rate: 

o 1 ETH = 28 RAC Tokens subject to the soft cap of 3,000 ETH. 

o 1 ETH = 24 RAC Tokens subject to the cap of 15,000 ETH. 

o 1 ETH = 18 RAC Tokens subject to the cap of 100,000 ETH. 

 The above value represents a total amount of (max) 1,902,000 RAC Tokens 

that are allocated to contributors during the ICO timeframe. The remaining 

98,000 RAC Tokens could be allocated in pre-sale upon request. 

 

 Launch date: 24th November 2017 

 Token launch time-frame: 30 days. 

 Token launch completion: Token launch will end when either the maximum 

number of ETH is raised or the deadline is reached, whichever is the earlier. If 

less than the minimum ETH is raised, ETH can be retrieved by RAC Token 

holders. 

  



 

 

37 
 

 

4.2. Token Distribution 

 4,000,000 RAC Tokens will be generated. 

 25% of RAC Tokens will be reserved for the team, (including advisors) 

 25% of RAC Tokens will be reserved for RoboAdvisorCoin Platform. 

 (Up to) 50% of RAC Tokens will be distributed to contributors during the ICO 

(potential remaining RAC Tokens will be kept by the RoboAdvisorCoin 

platform). 

 RAC Tokens held by the company will be used to incentivize other systems to 

interact with the platform. 

 The Company commits to hold at least 90% of these retained RAC Tokens for 

the next 12 months. 

 Potential use of those RAC Tokens will be announced and explained with at 

least 1 month notice.

4.3. Budget Allocation 

SteadyWealth is targeting to raise at least 2,500 ETH in order to help finance 

the development of its RoboAdvisorCoin platform therefore its business strategy. The 

structure for the utilisation of ICO proceeds is designed to ensure the platform's 

profitability in the long run with minimaloperational risks.  

 

SteadyWealth is committed to implement its strategy in the best interest of 

RAC Token holders. The ETH budget that will be used to carry out the project can be 

broken down as follows: 

 

 RAC Team - Research and Development: 60% of budget. This financing allows 

for the rollout of the RAC solution, the necessary evolution to anddevelopment 

of the existing RoboAdvisorCoin platform. 

 Administration: 10% of budget. It consists of RAC accounting, legal, 

securityand administration costs. 

 Marketing: 15% of budget. Marketing will focus on expanding awareness and 

adoption of the RoboAdvisorCoin platform among users, traders and third-

party systems. This also includes the growth and maintenance of the world-

wide community. 

 Contractors: 6% of budget. These funds will be directed at third-party providers 

offering engineering, marketing, partnerships, affiliate programs and more. 

 Reserve/Contingency: 9% of budget.

5. Roadmap 

The product development timeline might not be final and is subject to change 

depending on the feedback received from initial customers. During the past three 

years, the Company hastested a preliminary version of the software and the platform 

to test the effectiveness and the reliability of the AI solution. The roadmap followed 

pre-ICO can be detailed as follows: 

 

 

 

 

- 2013 - Start 

Birth of the AI Project after a successful trial in the B2B world with two 

financial institutions. 

- 2014 – First Platform release 

Constant R&D to improvethe algorithm and developing an advanced IT 

platform. 

- 2015– Robo-Portfolios: Virtual Automated Portfolios 

Our platform starts to simulate automated assets allocation proposals, 

namely simulated Robo-portfolios. 

- 2016 – Robo-Advisor for all 

Our team develops prediction and automated asset allocations toolsfor 

private users. 

In April our platform began generating and sending out automated reports 

and weekly news articlesincluding stocksmarket analysis and forecasts. 

- 2017 – Premium services 

Our RoboAdvisor elaborates and generates daily predictions about stocks, 

ETF’s, currencies, mutual funds, bonds, etc. 

InMarch, our AI platform offers analytics on small cap sectors (e.g., AIM 

Italy index, AIM UK index, etc.). 



 

 

40 
 

 

- 2017 August– Minimal Viable Product (Self-funded) 

In August, we became the first Robo-Advisor engine ableto offer simple 

forecasts related to Cryptos and tokens. 

 

The current platform is already functioning and the idea of the ICO is to take 

our service to a next level which allows SteadyWealth to become a world-leading 

provider of on-demand forecasts and analytics for global markets and Cryptos. The 

roadmap post-ICO is as follows: 

 

- 2017 October – ICO 

Our priority after the token launch will be to expand our Team to improve the 

expertise and operations in the Robo-advisory domain. We intend to attract the 

most talented and accomplished personnel currently available in relevant areas 

including: Blockchain, Machine Learning, Fintech industries and Financial 

Markets. 

 

- Mid 2018 – Milestone 1 (3,000 ETH) 

We aim at developing a new generation of Robo-advisor for the Crypto market 

analysis and forecasts. This means that we plan to further improve our existing 

infrastructure both relating to the production of accurate and timely forecasts 

and the production of personalized news. In addition to that, as part of 

Milestone 1, we plan to create indexes for Cryptoswhich approximate market 

trends for the sector and contain all the currently existing Cryptos and Token. 

The RoboAdvisorCoin platform will be the first system able to accept RAC 

Tokens in exchange for crypto financial analysis and all the services based on 

our AI engine. We will carry out marketing activities to promote our updated 

platform to a greater number of countries, including in Asia. 

 

 

 



 

 

41 
 

 

- Late 2018 – Milestone 2 (15,000 ETH soft cap reached) 

This phase will allow us to fully develop a Robo-advisor system powered by 

smart contracts. The system will offer its new services as described in this 

white paper: real-time Crypto and token predictions, crypto customized 

statistics, crypto Robo-Race and Beat the Botservices. Advantageous 

conditions will be granted to RAC Token holders. 

 

- Mid 2019 – Milestone 3 (100,000 ETH hard cap reached) 

This phase will allow us to work at expanding and decentralizing our existing 

architecture using blockchain technologies. We will use Blockchain to ensure 

and verify the authenticity, the accuracy and moreover the integrity of the 

predictions made by our Robo-Advisor engine.  

The ability to provide on-demand forecasts represents a key building block for 

an innovative tool which will be specifically designed for Miners, with the 

primary intent of delivering analytics designed to help optimize their production 

functions and profitability.  

The logic behind this service is that Miners will be able to process on demand 

predictions of Cryptos which are of interest to them (from within the current 

Crypto universe) and couple the knowledge provided by the platform with their 

proprietary information on the available production technology in order to 

choose the Crypto which is the most profitable to mine at any given time. In the 

absence of a term structure of futures contracts, such on-demand service 

provided by the platform will certainly prove to be crucial information for 

Miners and market operators. 

We will also plan to move our operations to the Middle East, which has a huge 

Ethereum community and extremely good business environment for Fintech 

companies. Moreover, it has a great connection to our go to market, namely 

Asia.

6. Results: Performance Obtained by our AI Software 

Since 2015, in order to track the real performance of our AI stock picking algorithms, 

our team created a public section on our website with the specific goal of listing 

hundreds of simulated portfolio proposals, denoted as Robo-portfolios (no real asset 

allocations were performed in our simulations). 

Each Robo-portfolio used our AI predictive platform to perform a theoretical 

optimal allocation over a specific geographic area. For each area, we have created at 

least 3 Robo-portfolios (one for each different level of risk, i.e., low, medium and high 

risk). Every day, the system has updated the virtual performance of each Robo-

portfolio on the website, so that every user of the platform could evaluate the quality 

of our Robo-Advisor. 

For each portfolio, subscribers can check the virtual performance of specific 

portfolios, the historical values, as well as details of the asset allocations. For each 

individual allocation of a given portfolio, it is always possible to get the virtual return 

generated and, above all, the prediction of the Robo-Advisor in terms of the probability 

of upside. Every month the Robo-Advisor may choose to automatically optimize every 

portfolio to reflect the new stock allocations based on potential scenarios detected by 

the algorithm for global markets.  

Periodically, our team asks the AI platform to create new simulated portfolios 

to increase the number of publicly available Robo-portfolios. We would point out that 

users can find up-to-date daily performance reports for every Robo-portfolio 

generated. As of now, the total number of simulated portfolios is 264, differentiated 

on more than 30 stock exchanges worldwide. Table 1 shows performance extract 

from the Robo-portfolios. Those statistics refers to the last 3 years of existence. Data 

is cumulative: this means that the third column (year 2017) contains data related to 

all the Robo-Portfolios generated so far. 



 

 

43 
 

 

The reports have been generated on the 15th September 2017 and show that 76.52% 

of the Robo-portfolios have generated positive (virtual) returns with an average gain 

of 5.3%. Looking at the portfolios with positive (virtual) returns, the average gain is 

about 7.4%. On the other hand, if we look only the portfolios that have generated 

negative (virtual) returns the average loss is -1.5%.

6.1. Case Study: The Brexit Referendum 

A case study for the success of our AI-based platform is represented by the 

correct prediction of market trends following Brexit well before the date of the 

referendum results. In this respect, we have been able to demonstrate that our 

platformhasbeen able to successfully navigate the troubled waters of global finance 

that have, over different periods, been severely impacted by phenomena such as 

Brexit.  

In a referendum on 23 June 2016, 51.9% of the participating UK electorate 

voted to leave the EU. The performances of all the virtual Robo-Portfolios which were 

generated by the Robot for generic British customers havegeneratedpositive returns: 

theHigh-Risk Portfolio (generated 7 months before, on November 12th, 2015) 

generated, at the time of writing this document, positive (virtual) returns equal to 

+27%, the Medium-Risk Portfolio generated annualised (virtual) returns of +14.28% 

and the Low-Risk Portfolio generated an impressive (virtual) return of +13.84%.  

This is indeed quite remarkable: our AI platformgenerated different strategies 

regarding stocks exposure just before the referendum (depending on the risk profile 

of the simulated portfolio). As for the High-Risk profile, the Robo-advisorhighlighted 

particular sectors which would turn out to benefit strongly from the Brexit vote. These 

reports were published “ex-ante” on the website including news items published by 

the financial press at the time.

The following charts show the virtual portfolios’ values from May the 1st 2016 

to July the 31th 2016 of the 3 UK Robo-Portfolios. The trend lines show a clear 

uptrend for the strategies applied to the 3 profiles. The “Brexit poll” point in the 3 

charts represents the day after the Brexit Referendum, in which the deep uncertainty 

of those days had temporarily caused small losses for each of our portfolios. (Virtual) 

gains exploded in the succeeding days thanks to the precise and accurate positioning 

of our optimal simulatedallocations.

portfolio.6 

 
 

Figure 13 - Trend of the equivalent value (in GBP) of the UK LowRisk portfolio.6 

The article below was published on MilanoFinanza on the 11th June 2016 with 

our platform indicationson Brexit, just two weeks before the vote. 

“The polls have been reporting a head-to-head vote for months against Brexit. The 

referendum with more implications for the European financial markets has probably 

always been, for if the UK were to vote for the exit from the European Union, the 

domino effects reported by many experts would almost be external shocks: 

significant devaluation of the pound; capital flight; loss of GDP, etc.” 



 

 

48 
 

 

Analysing the same context through the lenses of our Robo-Advisor, the 

situation looks different. Indeed, one could even get to the point that markets were 

betting on Brexit from a point of view of market opportunity in certain sectors / asset 

classes, rather than as a risk. The "contrarian" approach, analysing strategies, seems 

to gain momentum, signalling that a possible exit from the EU would not be so 

catastrophic to the British economy. The tailwinds that were driving our Robo-

allocation began to change early in April of this year with various trends becoming 

evident which reinforced this change in view.  Depending on the automated 

algorithms, we noticed how the Robo-advisor started to (virtually) overweight specific 

stocks with a greater “Value” profile.Over the last two months the Pound Sterling has 

depreciated against most major global currencies, with a strong declineagainst the 

Euro. 

Again, our forecast took a contrarian approach – i.e. it viewed it as the UK 

gaining a competitive advantage in terms of global trade rather than as a catastrophic 

result, as many had predicted. 

This shows that the SteadyWealth AI platform could position correctly in 

advance of the Brexit vote and discern opportunities and trends in politically-led 

markets. More generally, as of May 2017, SteadyWealth was very close to being able 

to report 100% success given that more than 90% of the Robo-portfolios could 

generate (virtual)positive returns, a position so far not achieved by human based 

strategies. As forour earliest portfolios, which have been affected by path dependant 

volatility skew, the percentage is about close to 80%.

7. Platform model and architecture 

Our existing platform is made up of the several components.  

 

The servers of the existing platform core layer are located as part of a 

technological infrastructure that makes use of Cloud Computing of IaaS type 

(Infrastructure as a Service). It provides access to a server belonging to a virtual 

environment. The use of Cloud Computing, along with the subdivision of the main 

components of the platform in different droplets/physical machines, provides 

flexibility to our architecture and scalability. This is because our system can adapt to 

any load variation by exploiting a large allocation of memory and computational 

resources provided by the Cloud. The servers running the core layer have the 

following responsibilities: 

 

 To host the business logic of the Robo-advisory system, along with the database of 

all securities and Cryptos, with the associatedprice quotes. 

 To host the algorithms. 

 

Our platform also provides APIs for most of the operations supported by the 

platform. RAC holders will be provided with several advantages for interacting with 

the Robo-Advisor APIs. As an example, APIs will be useful to retrieve the forecast of a 

given security or Crypto and to integrate our services with third parties.Our updated 

platformwill be connected to the Ethereum blockchain. The platform will let users to 

use their RAC on a 24/7 basis.  

 

In the era of Big Data, the prerequisite for developing a system which can 

constantly operate at the highest level of performance is not only to have access to a 

huge database of securities but to be able to extract the relevant data at the relevant 

time in the most effective way. Our system has a database that covers most of the 

financial world, and its extension enables us to investigate a huge amount of data in 



 

 

50 
 

 

any directions, training the Artificial Intelligence in the best way, and giving us 

exhaustive information on the financial scenario. In addition to this, new situations 

and new market behaviors help to create a constantly evolving knowledge base that 

allows artificial intelligence to adapt to market developments, new trading behaviors, 

and to remain efficient over time.The Robo-advisor financial technology is based on 3-

Layer process: 

 
 

Figure 14 – The 3 layers of the financial technology 

 

Step 1:The first step of our algorithmic framework is to update prices and volumes, in 

addition to several observable state variables which turn out to have predictive 

content for security prices. The data feed comes from different suppliers, depending 

on the securities typology (Bonds, Stocks, etc.) and our database construction 

framework extracts the most part of quantitative phenomena entropy by calculating 

specific indicators. All the data (quotes and indicators) are uploaded in the database, 

and it constitutes the training data sample for the next layers. 

 

Step 2: The second layer calculate a set of indicators that summarize the large 

information set from the universe of predictors available.The algorithm uses a list of 

threshold and intervals to detect indicators and these thresholds/intervals 

distributions change over the time, per the market evolution. 

 



 

 

51 
 

 

Step 3:The last layer produces the platform outputs by elaborating input information 

in an adaptive way given the required targets and risk profile. Figure 18 summarizes 

these three steps.  

 

These three steps represent the core of our AI-based predictive system for a 

wide range of securities spreading all over the world. Together with these predictions, 

the algorithm also calculates a set of risk analytics, such as VaR, Expected Shortfall, 

and performance ratios, e.g. Sharpe Ratio.The database naturally contains the entire 

volume of calculated data, which is also used for the future algorithm re-training 

phases.   

Nowadays the statistics of our existing AI algoritms applied to the real market 

provide us with sufficient confidence to engage the challenge of Crypto forecasts. In 

the B2B application the supported asset management strategies applied to traditional 

securities outperformedtheir benchmarks and reached their objectives, with the 

Sharpe Ratios always over 1. For instance the Total Return strategy, called 

'ValoreReale' (market neutral - European Stocks with Hedged percentage)  generated 

an annual return of +11,14% with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.62; the  Market Neutral 'M-

Forex' (Currencies - conservative profile) generated an annual return +4,00% with 

Sharpe of 1.03;  Total Return semi-neutral 'USACrono'  (market neutral - American 

Stocks with Hedge) generated an annual return +7,57%, with a Sharpe of 1.36; Total 

Return 'CRONO Alta' (Long strategy on Bonds and ETF) generated an annual return 

+4,94% with a Sharpe of 1.21. 

From a technological standpoint, SteadyWealth is a system with an AI 

architecture that is designed to be flexible and scalable. While the technology 

infrastructure is cloud-based, as described above, the distinct pure financial and web 

tasks are also logically separate: the ones described in this section, devoted solely to 

the algorithm, are the result of the integration of the mathematical / statistical Open 

Source R software, along with all the necessary packages, with the MySQL resident 

database, also linked to backend services. In this environment, the Company can run 



 

 

52 
 

 

all the punctual analysis and forecasting tools as well as expose (with API) all the 

financial functions needed for the backend application. 

 

Thanks to the planned ICO, our platform and AI algorithms will be upgraded to 

become more powerful and accurate by focusing on the provision of a broad range of 

financial research reports based on Crypto analytics. 

 

7.1. Expanding and Decentralizing the Architecture 

The RoboAdvisorCoin platform will evolve by using blockchain technology. 

Decentralization of the RoboAdvisorCoin platform will ensure increased security, trust 

and reliability,which means that subscribers will have incontrovertible evidence that 

any report produced by the Robo-advisor are free from any human interaction. This 

concept will be of great commercial value to the RoboAdvisorCoin platform, and by 

extension therefore to our RAC Token holders: who will become part of a very special 

community, in which the platform delivers accurate reports, with complete neutrality. 

Decentralization will strengthen our platform. Any forecast or prediction related 

to a security or a Crypto will be stored using the Blockchain technology so that 

tampering with forecasts will not be possible. A public Blockchain like Ethereum 

would be used to store the financial forecasts, even if the final choice and precise 

implementation will be evaluated by our team. 

The most interesting challenge will be given by the decentralization of the 

prediction algorithm through the Blockchain: this means that every user will be able to 

run the prediction algorithm on demand for computing the forecasts of his/her 

personal “play list” of preferred cryptocurrency and token enriched with a set of any 

kind of useful information on them. This will constitute the first step for building an 

innovative tool to miners to optimize their production functions in terms of 

profitability.
