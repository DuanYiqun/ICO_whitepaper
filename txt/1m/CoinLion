1.0 Beginnings 
Throughout history the lion has long been a symbol of stability, power, and trust.  For that reason 
it has appeared on coins dating back as early as 600BC. Lion Coins are some the world’s oldest 
coins and were important in the creation of history’s first civilizations. Times and technology have 
changed, but the principles remain the same. CoinLion was founded on the symbolism the lion 
embodies and aims to be synonymous with a name users can trust.  

2.0 Abstract 
Blockchain technology has made it possible 
to transact digital assets without the need 
for a trusted third party. Participants are 
able send and receive in a decentralized 
manner, while relying on continual 
validation of transactions.[1] These 
transactions rely on cryptography to 
encrypt and secure information relating to 
each specific transaction. Thus the term 
cryptocurrency.[2] 
 

Using these technologies, new 
decentralized applications (dApps) are 
being created at a rapid rate. DApps are 
performing functions ranging from 
distributed storage, distributed cloud 
computing, decentralized financial 
applications, decentralized advertising, and 
more. This has given way to digital tokens 
or digital assets representing real world 
goods/services as well as digital 
goods/services. As digital currencies, 
dApps, and digital assets are continually being created, the way in which parties transact and 
manage these assets needs to improve.  
 
Currently the absence of quality information and easy-to-use tools has created a barrier to entry 
for users. There is a need for trusted applications that allow everyday users to exchange and 
manage digital assets easily and efficiently. In addition, there is no way to manage hundreds of 
digital assets efficiently. 
 
The CoinLion Platform gives users the tools they need to make expert trading decisions.  The 
platform also give users the power to learn, grow and build by sharing portfolios, strategies, and 
research. A native token, LION, gives users the potential to earn by providing value to the 
community and the CoinLion Platform, in turn creating an ecosystem where users can earn and 
spend while trading and managing digital assets. 
 

CoinLion is building the world’s first 
cryptocurrency trading platform 
with built-in portfolio management, 
atomic swaps, publishing and 
promotional toolset, dual blockchain 
order book system, and token 
generation capabilities. 
 
Using the ERC20 smart contract 
powered by Ethereum, CoinLion will 
introduce a token, LION, that 
interacts with the platform. Users 
can spend and earn LION in many 
ways, including creating and sharing 
portfolios, strategies, research and 
content relating to the management 
of cryptocurrencies.  



 5 

LION has many uses within the platform, allowing any user to spend and earn LION in a variety of 
ways. This includes earning LION from the CoinLion Platform itself.  LION can be earned by (i) 
creating and sharing portfolios, research, and strategies with other users, (ii) submitting research 
CoinLion publishes within the platform, (iii) becoming a top performer within the CoinLion Platform, 
and (iv) allowing advertisers to access your public profile and more.  
 
Spend LION to (i) follow and duplicate users’ portfolios (ii) create and publish multiple portfolios 
and access advanced features within the portfolio management tool (iii) access premium features 
within a world class research and analytics library (iv) promote your portfolios on CoinLion’s 
featured portfolio list (v) trade for free within the LION market, and (vi) access discounts on ICOs 
featured on the platform.   
 
CoinLion aims to simplify and enhance the user experience when managing digital assets. CoinLion 
is building an environment where users are empowered to create and share portfolios, strategies, 
research, and more.  

3.0 Market Context  
The market cap of digital currencies has grown from 91 billion in May 2017 to exceeding 175 
billion in September 2017. Currently there are thousands of cryptocurrencies in the form of digital 
assets and more are continually being created.[3] 

 
To date, Bitcoin has been the dominant currency in the 
cryptocurrency market. A general grasp of 
cryptocurrency markets is not yet understood by the 
majority of the population; and studies have shown that 
the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, is more complex 
and established than public perception. The way the 
cryptocurrency markets have evolved mirrors the 
evolution of other markets and ecosystems.[5]   
 
While the current market cap stands at well over $100 

billion,[3] this pales in comparison to the total supply of fiat currency in circulation, estimated at 
over $60 trillion. Fiat currency continues to pour into digital assets. Digital currencies also continue 
to take market share from other assets such as stocks, bonds, precious metals, and alternative 
investments. These factors combined leave an enormous amount of head room for 
cryptocurrencies to continue to expand.  
 
There are over 5.8 million private and institutional participants exchanging digital tokens and 
currencies and the participation rate is growing rapidly. These studies suggest the future landscape 
of digital assets and currencies will look much different than they do today.[4] 
 
 

CoinLion allows for the 
management and exchange 
of cryptocurrencies while 
providing users with the 
tools they need to manage 
assets efficiently and earn 
the native token LION.

4.0 Existing Problems 
Early applications used to trade and manage cryptocurrencies have been riddled with challenges. 
One of the first exchanges, GBL, a Chinese Bitcoin trading platform, was shut down in 2013 and 
lost nearly $5 million in customer Bitcoin. Mount GOX, one of the earliest and most prominent 
exchanges was shutdown in 2014 and had lost nearly 390 million in customer Bitcoin. These 
exchanges have been challenged with security issues that have costs users millions of dollars.[6] 
Exchanges available today are still limited. In addition to security issues, they have limited access 
to trading tools, customer service, research, liquidity and more.  
 
Existing exchanges and platforms have failed to deliver a powerful user-friendly platform that 
provides the tools and research needed for the beginner and advanced alike to effectively manage 
digital assets. Currently, there exists a disconnect between the tools and research that exist in the 
modern financial world and the tools and research that exist in the cryptocurrency and digital asset 
space. This is causing a barrier to entry for a large percentage of the population. 
 
Existing exchanges are not providing users with the tools, research, and analytics they need to 
manage portfolios, access research, and execute strategies. This creates a cumbersome and 
confusing user experience, especially for the beginner, when there are thousands of digital assets 
to choose from.  
 
In addition to limited trading tools, exchanges in existence today do not provide a platform for 
users to share relevant information with other users.  

5.0 Introduction  
 
CoinLion will solve the problems of existing exchanges and build the world’s first 

cryptocurrency exchange with built-in portfolio management, atomic swaps, dual 

blockchain order book system, research, analytics, social integration and token 

generation capabilities.  

In today’s environment, managing digital assets can be difficult, even for the experienced. The 
CoinLion Platform empowers users when managing digital assets. There is a need for simple and 
powerful tools that eliminate barriers to entry for everyday users.  
 
Presently, those trading digital assets are often using different methods, platforms and wallets. 
Many have taught themselves through countless hours researching how to exchange and manage 
these new assets in a safe, secure and efficient manner. For the inexperienced, managing and 
trading cryptocurrencies can be frustrating, challenging, and time consuming.  
 



 7 

Our team understands the difficulty and challenges in dealing with various wallets, applications, 
and exchanges. The existing methods can be difficult to use and confusing while providing little or 
no customer service.  
 
CoinLion looks to deliver value to a future trillion dollar blockchain economy and connect millions 
of traders, giving them a platform to manage digital assets easily and efficiently.  
 
A key feature within the Coin Lion ecosystem is the ability to create portfolios of digital assets with 
the Portfolio Management Tool. Users can also choose to allow their portfolios to be shared and 
tracked by other traders on a time specific basis in exchange for LION. This allows traders to 
generate LION simply for sharing their portfolios and strategies with the community. 
 
New users are faced with many 
concerns when it comes to managing 
cryptocurrencies such as, security, legal, 
ease of use, and customer service. 
CoinLion understands these concerns 
and is addressing them. There exists a 
gap between what is currently in the 
marketplace and what individuals really 
want and need.  

6.0 Value Proposition 
CoinLion is building a simple yet powerful platform that enables users to not only exchange digital 
assets, but also earn and spend the native token, LION, for sharing portfolios, research, and 
strategies.  
 
CoinLion is focused on improving issues facing existing exchanges: 

 
o User accessibility and ease of use 
o Managing multiple digital assets  
o Access to information, research and tools 
o Understanding Risk 
o Legal Environment 
o Security  
o Customer Service 

6.1 Ease of Use 
Users need to feel comfortable interacting with these technologies. As we have been building out 
the CoinLion trading platform we have utilized industry leading tools to create a user interface that 
is simple, easy to use, and powerful.  

CoinLion’s market fit is undeniable. The 
crypto space needs powerful portfolio 
management tools combined with 
sophisticated reporting. CoinLion is 
solving a fundamental problem, and will 
continuously improve the platform 
using cutting-edge technologies. 



 8 

6.2 Managing Multiple Digital Assets 
CoinLion brings modern portfolio management tools to the world of digital assets. Today, managing 
multiple digital assets using multiple wallets across various platforms is inefficient.  Data and 
information is difficult to aggregate, making it a challenge to properly manage portfolios. With 
CoinLion, users can build and manage portfolios easily.  

6.3 Access & Share Information 
A key feature within the Coin Lion platform is the ability to share portfolios and information with 
other users. Users can create portfolios with a simple and powerful portfolio management tool. 
These portfolios can then be tracked by other users in exchange for LION. This allows users to 
generate LION for sharing strategies with members who desire to use the information to manage 
their personal cryptocurrency portfolios. CoinLion is also building a world-class research and 
analytics library. In addition to custom research, CoinLion will purchase research from users with 
LION.  

6.4 Understanding Risk 
CoinLion is a unique, fully integrated, digital asset management solution, combining risk analytics 
with portfolio management, trading and analytical tools to support disciplined, efficient and 
controlled digital asset management processes. CoinLion believes that users should be able to 
easily interpret the risks within their portfolios. The platform tools allow users to better understand 
the risks they are exposing themselves to within their holdings.  

6.6 Legal Environment 
The regulatory environment in the cryptocurrency space is in constant flux. With shutdowns and 
restrictions placed on exchanges around the globe, keeping up with regulation and government 
compliance has been critical to the continued success of exchanges. CoinLion retains a dedicated 
legal team that is focused solely on the compliance of CoinLion with regulatory and governing 
entities. 15% of the funds raised in the token sale will be attributed directly to legal.  

6.6 Security 
A core objective of Coin Lion is to create a secure exchange that users can trust.  Both the security 
of the user’s information and accounts, as well as security of the code and token is imperative. 
15% of all the funds contributed during the token sale will be directly allocated to enforcing 
security measures.  

6.7 Customer Service 
The industry does not have the customer service infrastructure in place to accommodate the 
volume of various user issues. CoinLion changes this by implementing a customer service and 
support model ensuring users’ concerns are addressed and resolved promptly. 
 
CoinLion is building out a customer service team. We understand the need for users to be able to 
communicate directly with a representative via phone, chat, and support ticket. 5% of all funds 
raised will go directly to enhancing customer service and support.

7.0 CoinLion Platform Features 

7.1 Portfolio Management Tool (PMT) 
The CoinLion PMT is a state-of-the-art portfolio management tool. It allows users to create and 
manage portfolios in a simple and efficient manner. With the PMT users can buy and sell multiple 
assets with a single click. 
 
Users can select to purchase a group of assets by amount, quantity, or percentage, and submit 
the order in one click. Market orders will be executed at the best possible price across the 
various assets. Users can choose to execute these orders at the market price, or choose to place 
more advanced orders for each asset. This allows portfolios to be managed easily and efficiently, 
putting the user in total control of their assets.  
 
CoinLion PMT also allows users to publish portfolios and name their price in LION for allowing 
other users to track their portfolios. Publishers of portfolios can set a cost in LION for tracking a 
specific portfolio over a period: monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or yearly. This empowers users by 
providing a means to generate LION for creating and sharing portfolios.  
 
The user also has the option to allow their portfolio to be publicly tracked and published to the 
portfolio tracker within CoinLion. This allows to users to showcase their skills when it comes to 
managing digital assets, and in turn generate additional LION by driving traffic to the portfolio. Top 
performers within the CoinLion Platform will receive LION bonuses from CoinLion.

7.3 Wide Variety of Fiat, Crypto & Digital Assets 
CoinLion will support a wide variety of fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and digital assets. As digital 
assets and currencies are continually being created, having simple and efficient access to those 
assets is critical.  
 
CoinLion will support most major currencies and assets and apply a strict due diligence process to 
acceptance of new currencies. CoinLion will maintain markets in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and LION.  

7.4 Dual Blockchain System (DBS)  
CoinLion’s order book utilizes a dual blockchain, specifically designed for speed, to track and 
monitor transactions. The dual blockchain system ensures data integrity and transparency. Each 
blockchain is designed for a specific purpose. Working together these blockchains make it possible 
to achieve complete integrity, immutability, and transparency. 
 
The first blockchain stores specific data related to each buy and sell order placed and work in sync 
with the matching engine. The second block chain stores data specific to each trade that occurs. 
These blockchains are developed by CoinLion’s technology team and are meant to be a source of 
data for reporting and tracking purposes.  
 
This dual blockchain uses geographically distributed nodes to confirm transactions and preserve 
the decentralized nature of the blockchain.  

7.5 Publishing and Promotional Toolset 
CoinLion’s portfolio publishing and promotional toolset lets users publish created portfolios and 
content. Users can create and publish content related to digital assets. Users will have the option 
to add a price in LION for access to features on their profile. This could include access to portfolios, 
research, or strategies. Users will leverage their profiles to earn LION for creating and publishing 
portfolios, research, strategies, and more. The promotional toolset will also allow users to share 
their portfolios and content across various social media platforms.    

7.6 ICO Underwriting 
CoinLion will offer an ICO underwriting service which will list new coins to the platform. LION 
holders will have access to purchase these ICOs at a discounted rate.  CoinLion will use a rigorous 
due diligence process when evaluating adding a new coin to the platform. This is a six-step process 
that utilizes a set of criteria to rank potential ICOs.  
 
The due diligence process follows a robust qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate and 
select coins for the platform. Elements of the core screening process are customized to each coin.  
 
The quantitative factors include market size, projected growth potential, project duration and risk 
factors. The quantitative factor screen helps to eliminate projects that we feel are unlikely to be 
successful or deliver value to the purchasers or the platform.  
 



 11 

The qualitative factors include factors such as team, industry applications, marketing efforts, and 
utility.  
 
Each factor is analyzed using the six-step process and given a quantitative ranking resulting in an 
overall score. Only the top ICOs evaluated will be listed on the CoinLion Platform. 
 
ICO underwriting serves two purposes. The first is to offer users a wide variety of quality new 
coins on the platform. The second is to provide added liquidity for new coins.  

7.7 Blazing Fast Trade Execution, Atomic Swaps, Raiden and Lightning Networks 
Orders are facilitated using a dedicated order matching engine. This engine matches trading pairs 
at lightning speeds ensuring users are provided with the best execution possible. CoinLion utilizes 
new and emerging networks and technologies to provide users with alternatives to the traditional 
methods of trading and exchanging digital assets. Part of the CoinLion’s commitment to excellence 
insures that ongoing new technologies will be added to the platform. CoinLion will utilize networks 
such as the Raiden Network and Lightning Network provide users with the ability to use atomic 
swaps when trading digital currencies. Utilizing these networks will also speed up the process of 
implementing a fully decentralized model. 

7.8 LION Market 
CoinLion will maintain a market in LION. When trading in the LION market, users will enjoy free 
trades. This will work to ensure LION liquidity and stability over time. 

7.9 Cutting Edge Trading Tools 
The CoinLion Platform contains a suite of state-of-the-art trading and analytics tools. Choose from 
hundreds of studies to implement into portfolios, including a wide array of charting and technical 
analysis tools.  

7.10 Digital Asset Screener 
CoinLion implements the first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency and digital asset screener. This allows 
users to screen and rank criteria when selecting assets and portfolios, and easily implement them 
into their holdings. Criteria will be scaled as more information is known and as more portfolios are 
created. Initial criteria will include: market cap, price, volume, performance, maturity, and more. 

7.11 Simple & Powerful User Interface 
CoinLion provides a world-class user experience when it comes to trading and managing digital 
assets.  User information is displayed clearly. Access to tools and information is readily available. 
Users have the ability to customize views to their liking. Portfolio views and allocation views are

the users. CoinLion will be purchasing research from users using LION. In addition to free research 
and analytics, the research library will contain premium content available to access with LION.  



 12 

 

7.13 Sophisticated Reporting 
A robust reporting system uses information from the dual blockchain system and platform data to 
create a variety of reports for users to access. These reports make it easy for users to access the 
information they need. Reports include, but are not limited to, gain and loss reports, performance 
reports, transaction reports and more. These reports will aid users in tracking various metrics for 
purposes such as tax reporting, performance tracking, cost tracking and more. 

7.14 Trading Costs 
CoinLion is working hard to deliver a world-class experience to users at a lower cost than existing 
exchanges and platforms. There are no fees for having an account on the CoinLion Platform, and 
there are no maintenance or on-going fees. 
 
CoinLion will be a cost leader when it comes to trading costs and will use a tiered maker/taker 
volume rebate schedule, combined with a per trade cap. The base cost is .12% for the maker, and 
.20% for the taker, both with a cap at .5 ETH or equivalent BTC. 
 
Makers are those who place orders that are on the book before the trade occurs. The taker places 
the order that is matched with the maker’s order. This cost schedule promotes liquidity by 
encouraging makers to place orders. It also works to create tighter bid/ask spreads.  
 
The following table shows the cost at various volume. 
 
USER 30 DAY VOLUME TAKER  MAKER  
> 0 %  0.20% 0.12% 
> 2 %   0.18% 0.10% 
> 3 %   0.15% 0.10% 
> 5 %   0.13% 0% 
> 10 %   0.10% 0% 
> 20 %   0.08% 0% 

 
User volume is based off a rolling 30-period.  At the end of each day the users’ volume is calculated 
and trading costs are rebated accordingly.   
 
If a user holds LION, they will receive a 25% discount applied to the maker/taker cost schedule. 
The user must simply hold enough LION to cover the cost of the trade and the discount will be 
automatically applied to the trade. 

7.15 Algorithmic Trading Support 
The CoinLion trading Platform is designed to provide a powerful trading experience.  We 
understand that traders also trade through third-party platforms and design their own algorithmic 
trading bots. Our commitment is to provide the best trading experience possible, and we 
designed our APIs to allow for high frequency algorithmic trading.  



 13 

7.16 Margin Trading and Lending 
Margin trading loan interest users can choose to become margin loan providers and receive 
interest earnings with their asset deposits. CoinLion will calculate the interest using the 
relationship between margin trading loan supply and demand. A fraction of earnings generated 
from interest payments will be collected by CoinLion.

11.0 LION ALLOCATION 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

All funds received from the TOKEN SALE will be used for the development and operations of the 

CoinLion Platform. 

 

65% Development 

This includes the development of the CoinLion Platform and the recruitment of additional world-

class talent. A percentage of development funds will also be used to market and facilitate the 

ongoing operating costs such as servers and infrastructure. 

 

15% Security 

This includes auditing and compliance. CoinLion works tirelessly to ensure the security of all users' 

holdings. CoinLion uses multiple security protocols to achieve the highest level of security for 

users. A portion of security funds will also be used to insure users funds against cyber-attacks.  

 

15% Legal 

Legal compliance is critical to CoinLion’s long-term success and stability. CoinLion currently has in 

house legal counsel. In addition, CoinLion will utilize outside legal resources to ensure the ongoing 

compliance. CoinLion will look to fully comply with all regulation.  

 

5% Customer Service 

CoinLion looks to be the most trusted digital asset trading platform, and understands customer 

service is fundamental in creating trust with users. CoinLion is adding to its customer service team, 

and will facilitate users inquires via multiple channels, including dedicated phone support.   



 18 

 

The purpose of the LION token allocation and use of funds is to support the long-term 

sustainability of the CoinLion Platform.  

 

A minimum of 10% of the total supply of LION will remain in reserve. This 10% serves as a buffer 

to ensure the stability of LION.  

 

Unsold tokens will be moved to the reserve. Unsold tokens will be frozen subject to the following 

lockout periods: 

o 2 years 100% 
o 4 years 50% 
o 6 years 0% 

 

The excess reserve, not subject to lockup, will be used to facilitate the growth platform and of the 

research and analytics library, as well as to reward users. Holding the unsold tokens subject to the 

lockout periods will ensure stability of LION token and of the future of the platform. 

 

LION held by the team is subject to the following lockout periods before tokens can be sold: 

o 6 months 100% 
o 1 year 75% 
o 1.5 years 50% 
o 2 years 0% 

 

LION held by CoinLion, LLC is subject to the following lockout periods: 

o 1 year 100% 
o 2 years 75% 
o 3 years 50% 
o 4 years 25% 
o 5 years 0% 

 

LION held for ongoing development will be used at the discretion of CoinLion to fund continual 

research and advancements beyond the token sale, and is subject to a 1 year 100% lockup. The 

funds allocated for ongoing development are used for the implementation of new and emerging 

technologies to improve the performance of the platform. This includes technologies that allow for 

atomic swaps and aggregation of liquidity from existing exchanges.   

 

The combination of these policies work to maintain the integrity of the LION token and the long-

term sustainability of the platform. 

12.0 Technology Stack 
CoinLion Technology Stack Platform software components are being developed using the 

following stack:  

 

o Go 



 19 

o Raiden Network 
o Lightning Network 
o Solidity 
o JavaScript  
o Docker  
o EthereumJS 
o web3.js  
o IPFS  
o Python 

 

CoinLion utilizes the appropriate technology working in synergy to achieve the ultimate trading 

experience.  

13.0 Technical 
The CoinLion Platform will be built using the latest technologies, including Go.  Each component 

of the platform will be designed as a scalable micro-service and communicate via APIs.  CoinLion 

uses Docker and other virtualization technologies to allow for quick testing and deployment of 

updates in a controlled manner to each environment through all phases: development, testing, and 

production.   

 

CoinLion’s order book system will be broken into two independent but interconnected 

blockchains.  The matching algorithm can process over a million buy/sell orders and complete 

transactions within seconds. The order book application will leverage the first blockchain to 

maintain data integrity and immutability of orders, and the matching system will finalize the orders 

and complete the transactions to their respective blockchains. The dual blockchain system is 

designed to keep track of the orders within the platform and be a source of data. In addition to 

Ethereum, Bitcoin, and LION markets, we will be able to add other cryptocurrencies and markets 

to the platform as it evolves. 

 

The CoinLion exchange utilizes a hybrid model of both centralized and decentralized technology 

to deliver the best possible performance. The core code, which is doing the heavy lifting, is written 

in Go.
8]

 Smart contracts are written in the Solidity language native to Ethereum. The CoinLion 

Platform will interact with smart contacts to facilitate tasks related to the Ethereum blockchain.  

 

As CoinLion moves beyond the token sale and launch of the platform, the ongoing research and 

development will determine feasibility of moving to a decentralized model. Our team has 

extensively evaluated all the possible methods and technologies in which to build the CoinLion 

Platform. While the Coinlion team strongly supports a decentralized model, currently a hybrid 

model provides a better user experience. CoinLion has also researched chain interoperability.
[7]

 As 

blockchains become more prevalent, interoperability will be addressed. CoinLion will utilize all 

necessary technologies to give the user the best possible experience.  

 



 20 

14.0 Roadmap 
CoinLion is working diligently to continually add features to the platform in order to provide the 

ultimate trading experience. Upon conclusion of the token sale, rigorous ongoing development will 

continue until launch of the platform. New cryptocurrencies and digital assets will be continually 

added to the platform. Features, research, and services will expand as demand increases.
