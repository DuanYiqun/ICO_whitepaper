Project Description and 
Plot Concepts

3 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

1.0

Mirocana is a complex, self-reinforcing system based on deep-learning neural nets 
and other modern machine learning models that predicts stock, currency and cryp-
to-currency markets. We collect, store, process and analyze huge volumes of financial 
data. The entire system is designed to constantly increase the accuracy of predic-
tions. 

Mirocana Company was founded in March of 2015. Since that time we have raised ven-
ture money and built a reliable and successful trading prediction system for ourselves. 
We manage our funds using this AI-system, and we have a strong vision on how our 
products will change investment industry. Today, sophisticated investing algorithms 
and AI-powered trading robots are only available to a limited number of market play-
ers. Companies like WorldQuant, BlackRock, Aidyia, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, 
Tow Sigma and plenty of others that we do not know about, develop these complex 
algorithms and keep the technology to themselves. They spend hundreds of millions 
of dollars each year to hire thousands of highly paid quantitative analysts, algo-traders 
and data scientists to gain a competitive edge that is unreachable to a retail investor. We 
want to change that. We aim to create a system that will be available to our token-hold-
ers, is designed to constantly increase the accuracy of predictions, and is empowered 
not only by the members of our team but by many interested people around the world. 

For our token-holders, we are developing three simple investment analysis products 
based on predictions of the Mirocana system. We believe that transparency is the 
key-point of our products. We are not a hedge-fund, we do not take customers’ funds 
to our accounts and our token is not a financial asset. We help customers manage their 
funds on their broker or exchange accounts without any rights to withdraw or transfer 
the funds, so our customers are secure. The customers can easily observe at what po-
sitions the system opens and closes. Each customer is able stop using our products and 
services at any time by revoking an access key. The access to our investment products is 
restricted by the amount of MIRO tokens on your account.

It’s difficult to consistently generate profits on stock, currency and crypto-currency 
markets, but we intend to build a system that will be able to do that, and we want this 
system to be accessible to many people, especially to our early-stage customers, not just 
people who have capital.

Mirocana Structure and 
Ecosystem

4 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

1.1

As the main theory of making predictions we use historical extrapolation. Mirocana 
is connected in real-time to dozens of different sources of data and it stores time series 
of data that, in some cases, stretch back as far as the 1950s. 

Any information can be interpreted in many different ways. Every data interpretation 
in the system is called a strategy. For every data source, Mirocana has at least several 
dozens of strategies.

http://MIROCANA.COM


Concept of Strategy

5 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

1.2

Strategy is an algorithm in the form of code that takes time series of quotes and series 
of data as an input (the data can be collected from one or more data sources) and pro-
duces an output. The output is a set of predictions in the format that is common for all 
the strategies in the system, so they remain comparable.

Prediction of the strategy contains information about direction (to buy or to sell), 
strength level, duration and meta data about market conditions in which this signal 
has occurred.

We use two types of strategies. Some strategies are only based on quotes data, while 
the other strategies are based on quotes + additional data (such as the activity of other 
traders, market data, fundamental data, tweets, news, etc.). 

The first type of strategies is not tied to a specific financial instrument or a time-
frame. We apply these strategies to every time-frame (ex: 1M, 1H, 4H, etc.) and to 
every instrument (ex: Apple shares, EUR/USD, BTC/ETH, etc.). That allows us to 
connect to a broker or an exchange and start to generate predictions rather quickly. 

The second type of strategies, on the contrary, is tied to an instrument and a time-
frame. However, it is more complex and provides increased accuracy of predictions.

Based on activity of traders, 
funds, and insiders Based on technical indicators Based on fundamental data

Based on news and articles Based on macroeconomic data and events
Based on graphical chart 
patterns

Based on symbols’ correlation Based on social media activity Autogenerated strategies

EACH STRATEGY IN THE SYSTEM CAN BE CLASSIFIED TO ONE OF THE 9 CATEGORIES

We have developed our own syntax for creating new strategies, it is optimized for a fast 
backtest and multi-thread calculations.

http://MIROCANA.COM


6 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

The majority of strategies in the system have, in their code, variables that vary in some 
limited range. That means that these strategies have hundreds and, in some cases, thou-
sands of sub-strategies with their own unique set of parameters and the logic of the 
main strategy. That allows us to find more patterns in data more accurately and increas-
es overall predictive accuracy. 

Moreover, we have developed a framework, which helps us to create new strategies, 
that are based on graphical chart patterns, much faster. The idea behind this method 
is that we set up an ideal pattern of price changes. After that, when we run a backtest of 
a strategy, it applies the function that measures the degree of coherence and similarity 
of current prices changes to an ideal pattern, and if the degree is higher than a threshold 
we generate a prediction to buy or to sell. This framework allows us to test dozens of new 
graphical chart patterns every week and add to the system only those that work.   

We possess an ever-growing number of strategies. The more strategies in the knowledge 
of the system - the more accurate predictions it produces. Our team and members of 
Mirocana Research Group are working every day to create new useful strategies and, in 
future, we will release Mirocana Alpha product, that will attract algo-traders and quan-
titative analysts from all over the world to help us to add new strategies in exchange for 
our MIRO tokens.

http://MIROCANA.COM


Concept of Simulation

7 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

1.3

Simulation is a function that takes as input time series of quotes and series of pre-
dictions of all the strategies in the system. Then, according to its logic it calculates the 
weights among strategies using deep-learning neural nets and other machine learning 
models to produce cumulative predictions. Afterwards, using this cumulative predic-
tions and the logic of risk management and position sizing logic, it places buy and sell 
orders in the simulation environment.

To properly calculate the importance of every individual strategy (with its specific set of 
parameters) in final predictions, we use our own internal ML-products and open-source 
tools for machine learning and data science. Some of the open-source tools that we use:

TENSORFLOW XGBOOST CATBOOST 

LIGHTGBM H2O THEANO

In general, the weight of a strategy, calculated during a simulation, depends on a level 
of prediction’s accuracy and its consistency.

If a strategy is unable to find patterns in the series of data during a simulation, it is given 
a near-zero weight, so it will not affect a cumulative prediction. 

If a strategy constantly produces predictions with negative results - it is given a nega-
tive weight. It means that when this strategy indicates ‘buy’ - the simulation will ‘sell’, 
and vice versa.  

We have a number of simulations in the system with different logics of weights distri-
bution. Our team tests new configurations of neural nets, conducts new experiments ev-
ery day and adds new simulations. In future, we will release Mirocana Sigma product, 
which will attract talented data scientists from all over the world to continue to refine 
our product.

After all the results for all simulations are calculated, we deploy the best performing 
simulation to the production.

Concept of Data Source

8 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

1.4

Data Source is a code that is responsible for collecting and recording information 
from a site or a service to a database through a documented API or direct parsing. It can 
be data of any kind that we think may correlate with the assets’ prices, which we predict 
or will predict. 

WE COLLECT DATA FROM TENS OF DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: 

Thomson Reuters Quotes, fundamental and macroeconomic data.

OANDA Quotes, economic calendar and orderbook. 

Quandl Quotes, market data and fundamentals.

Interactive Brokers Quotes and market  data.

IEX Exchange Quotes and market data.

Poloniex Quotes and crypto-currencies market data.

Bloomberg LP Quotes and market data, sentiment data and news.

Autochartist Graphical chart patterns. 

Saxo TradingFloor Traders’ activity and market data. 

eToro Traders’ activity on the platform.

ZuluTrade Traders’ activity on the platform.

myfxbook Traders’ and algorithms activity.

ForexFactory Traders’ and algorithms activity.

Preqin Traders’ and hedge-fund managers’ activity.

Google Trends Searches and trends data.

Twitter Traders’ activity, announcements and news.

TipRanks Analytics and hedge-fund managers activity and insides.

PpsychSignal Traders’ sentiment analysis. 

Yahoo News News, articles and traders’ sentiment. 

Investing.com Economic calendar events, news, traders’ sentiment data.

SEC.gov Reports and data releases. Market activity data.

Direct News Sites Parsing News, articles and other information.

Each data source has at least a few dozens of strategies that interpret its data. Some 
strategies in the system are based on the information about the trading activity of thou-
sands of professional traders, analysts, experts and hedge-fund managers. We have 
models that can predict the rate of return of newly placed orders, based on the trader’s 
past performance. 

Our team negotiates the terms of partnership with new data vendors and we will be 
constantly implementing new public and private sources, including data sources with 
information about the activity of other market players.

Methods of Performance 
Improvement

9 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

2.0

The rate of return that we are able to generate, relatively to capital under management, 
highly depends on the accuracy of our predictions. We constantly add new data sourc-
es, strategies and simulations to the system to increase the accuracy of predictions. In 
order to attract the best and the brightest minds in the field of data analysis, we will roll 
out three platforms for crowd-sourced learning:

Mirocana Alpha is a web interface where any skillful quantitative analyst or an 
algo-trader will be able to create, test, optimize and evaluate his/her own strategy 
based on quotes data or the data from our data sources. Then we will value this 
strategy and consequently pay a reward for this strategy in MIRO tokens, that 
later can be used to access Mirocana Investment Products or exchanged for other 
crypto-currencies at the Exchange.

MIROCANA ALPHA

Mirocana Sigma is a web interface where any data scientist or mathematician 
will be able to create, validate, test and score his/her own predicting models based 
on our encrypted (obfuscated) predictions data. We will periodically conduct ker-
nel-based tournaments among data scientists. The top participants will be paid 
with MIRO tokens.

MIROCANA SIGMA

Mirocana Target is an Android and iOS app, as well as a web interface, where 
any person will be able to leave his/her predictions of future price movements for 
stocks, currencies and crypto-currencies and then get paid with MIRO tokens de-
pending on the accuracy and consistency of their predictions. 

MIROCANA TARGET

Our current research work heavily relies on the Mirocana Research Group: the com-
munity of more than 70 experienced data scientists, mathematicians, and quantitative 
analysts, who have interest in Mirocana development. We split our research work into 
several tasks and distribute these tasks among our Research Group. If the tasks are 
successfully done with required predictions accuracy and on time, we make a payout to 
the members of the Research Group. After a Token Sale we will be making our payouts 
in MIRO tokens, and after our Mirocana Alpha and Mirocana Sigma platforms are re-
leased, the members of Mirocana Research Group will be the first to join.

Infrastructure, Scaling and 
Token Mining

10 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

3.0

We have our own servers infrastructure, but rent additional servers as well. To store 
information from data sources we use MongoDB, to store quotes data, simulations’ re-
sults, and predictions generated by each set of parameters of each strategy for each 
instrument and each time-frame we use ClickHouse. This is the only one open-source 
database that is capable of reading up to 700 million rows of data per second per server. 
It was open-sourced by Yandex in July of 2016, according to our benchmarks this is the 
fastest database currently available. 

The majority of our codebase is written in Python 3.4. This programming language 
has a simple syntax, so we are able to write (and read) our code faster. Plus, with this 
language, it is also easier to onboard a new developer. 

In future, we will rewrite our core functionality into other low-level languages in order 
to optimize and speed up our processes. To create these processes we consider Python 
as the best choice.

We are not developing high frequency trading algorithms, however, we declare an in-
terest in this field. 

Calculation of strategies’ backtest results for each instrument, for each time-frame and 
for each set of parameters, along with training of neural nets during a simulations, re-
quires a substantial computational power. We have created a task-worker logic of 
system’s operation: when we create a new strategy, systems create new tasks for back-
tests to be calculated. Today, workers that execute this tasks are running only on our 
servers. In future, when we experience a fast growing number of strategies and simula-
tions, it will be very reasonable for us to let many interested people with free computa-
tional power install our workers and start mining our MIRO tokens. We have plans to 
release Mirocana Miner product: this product will attract many interested miners from 
all over the world. Mining MIRO tokens could be much more profitable for miners than 
mining Ethereum or other crypto-currencies.

Mirocana Investment Analysis
Products

11 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

4.0

We possess three investment analysis products. The key value of these products is that 
you do not transfer your funds to our accounts. We aim to help manage your funds us-
ing our system on your account. The access to these products will be restricted by the 
amount of MIRO tokens on a customer’s account.

Our system predicts over 400 securities that are listed on NYSE and NASDAQ stock 
exchanges. We can set up an integration with your Interactive Brokers account 
and start analyzing how to help you manage your funds on your account using our 
Artificial Intelligence. This is our most valuable product and it is limited. Access will 
be granted only to TOP 200  people who have the most MIRO tokens on their bal-
ance by the end of the Token Sale. After the Token Sale you will only be able to get 
access if you have more than 5 million dollars to be managed by the system. 

This product will be available on the 1st of March, 2018 and every customer will 
have a personal account manager to help setting up an integration.

PRODUCT FOR STOCK MARKET

Our system predicts 125 currency pairs that are available with OANDA broker. We 
can connect our system to your account and start helping you manage your funds. 
To obtain access to this product you need to have at least 10,000 MIRO tokens on 
your account (if you purchased them during a the Token Sale) and 30,000 MIRO 
tokens (if you purchased them later at the exchange). 

This product will be available within a month after the Token Sale. In order to set 
up the integration, you will need to provide your access key (we will not have the 
rights to withdraw or transfer the funds) from your OANDA account.

PRODUCT FOR CURRENCY MARKET

Our system predicts 90 crypto coins that are traded on the Poloniex exchange. We 
can start allocating you coins on your behalf on the Poloniex exchange. To get access 
to this product you will be required to have at least 5,000 MIRO tokens on your 
balance (if you purchased them during a Token Sale), and 15,000 MIRO tokens 
(if you purchased them later at the exchange). 

This product will be available within two months after the Token Sale. You will 
need to provide your Poloniex Access Token and a Secret Key, we will not have the 
rights to withdraw or transfer the coins. 

PRODUCT FOR CRYPTO-CURRENCY MARKET

Mirocana token-holders who have access to one or more investment products will be 
able to set up a target return in their Mirocana Account for each product. Target 
return is the rate of annual return that you would like our system to achieve with the 
funds you have in your accounts with brokers our exchanges you choose. This value can 
be set from 5% to 150%. When you select the rate of target return the system will show 
the risk level that is associated with that rate of return. It will show maximum possible 
drawdown, profit factor, Sharpe ratio and other metrics that are commonly used to de-
termine the risk adjusted return results of the trading systems.

Long-Term Competitive 
Advantages

13 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

6.0

FLEXIBLE CODEBASE

We are a team of engineers and data scientists. And we solve a problem of predicting 
the markets as a data science problem. The majority of traditional trading firms use 
third-party software to write and backtest their strategies, therefore they are limited by 
that software. We wrote everything from scratch. We have developed our own engine to 
backtest strategies and to run the simulations. This allows us to quickly scale our system 
and unlocks an endless field for new exciting experiments.

HIGH SCALABILITY 

To constantly improve accuracy of system’s predictions we must add new data sources, 
new strategies and new simulations. We do that by our own but also we develop three 
products for crowd-sourced learning that will attract smart people from all over the 
world to help us. Furthermore, our Mirocana Miner product will solve the problem of 
constantly increasing needs for computing power. 

CUMULATIVE EFFECT

It is known that many traditional investment firms use a few dozens of strategies and 
manually allocate capital among them, trying to achieve balance. Our system bases its 
final predictions on all the strategies that we have at once. Each strategy by itself is able 
to generate profit but combining them together, using deep-learning neural nets and 
other ML-models, creates a cumulative effect - some sort of super-strategy that has the 
results that are better than the results of the best performing strategy. 

MARKET ADJUSTMENTS

Trading robots that are used by investment banks and trading firms may be very com-
plex, but the code that describes their logic is usually no more than 2 thousand lines. 
Such algorithms may work well for extended period of time, but when the behavior of 
market is changed, these robots do not change, they start losing, and they are manually 
replaced by another working algorithm. Mirocana system is very different: if some strat-
egy stopped working, it will be given a low weight after some iterations and this strategy 
will not affect the final prediction.

ANALYSING HUMANS

Some of our strategies are based on the activity of human traders, analysts and hedge-
fund managers. Our system learns strong and weak sides of these traders based on their 
past performance and is able to predict their reaction on certain market events. By an-
alysing the reaction of a small fraction of traders, our system is able to extrapolate this 
reaction for the rest of them. 

http://MIROCANA.COM


14 MIROCANA.COM © Mirocana

BACKTEST LEGITIMACY

If you ever tried to code a trading strategy, you may noticed that your strategy shows 
very decent results on the backtest, but is not working quite well on the real data. This 
happens because you adjust and validate your strategy parameters based on the full 
result of the strategy, meaning based on future data that your strategy should not know. 
To prevent this you will need to develop you strategy on training data and validate it on 
the test data. In the Mirocana system, when a new simulation is launched it iterates over 
history, making training and testing at the same time, and it does not know anything 
about the future data - that ensures the legitimacy of our backtesting.

Token Sale Terms
7.0

To accelerate the velocity of our research and development we decided to make our 
investment products available to many people. We will conduct a Token Sale. By buying 
MIRO tokens during the Token Sale, you are buying the access key to our investment 
analysing products. After the Token Sale, MIRO token may get listed at one or more 
crypto-exchanges, if that happens, you may be able to exchange MIRO tokens for other 
crypto-currencies if you no longer want to have access to our AI-products. 

The supply of tokens is limited. Performance of our investment products permanently 
improves over time and more customers will want to access our products. It is possible 
that at some point in the future we will experience an extreme shortage of tokens. In 
that case, a secondary offering may be considered, but we will not conduct it until the 
end of 2019.
