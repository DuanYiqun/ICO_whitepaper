Introduction 

For investors around the world, real estate has long been considered a source of significant, stable 

return. The popularity of real estate investment is undeniable given its annual worldwide transaction 

volume of approximately US$660 billion, a figure that is steadily rising. All in all, the total wealth 

stored in real estate is estimated to run into the trillions of dollars. 

Unfortunately, vast amounts of capital are typically required in order to invest in real estate with the 

objective of realizing above-average return on investment – so much so that this asset class is out  

of reach for most individuals. Even for those investors who have the necessary capital, conventional 

methods of investing in real estate are fraught with inefficiency and disadvantages. Firstly, in addition 

to paying several middlemen for their services, the many vagaries of local regulation and taxation 

make it difficult for individual investors to realize reasonable returns. Secondly, real estate invest-

ments are relatively illiquid, meaning that invested capital is not easily accessible in the short term. 

Thirdly, the real estate business is by nature a local affair, an obstacle that many investors fail to take 

into account. Local marketplace knowledge is essential in order to gain access to high-quality deal 

flow. Without knowledge of a given locale’s specific conditions and constraints, the potential for re-

turn on investment is severely limited while the risk skyrockets. That places investors in the dreaded 

position of obtaining lower returns at higher risk.

REALISTO addresses these issues by using the blockchain technology of Ethereum-based smart 

 contracts and by applying expert industry savvy alongside specialized local knowledge. Essentially, 

REALISTO is a platform that enables real estate experts to present their projects, launch their own 

 asset-backed tokens for those projects, and invite virtually anybody to invest in a selection of carefully 

curated, high-yield investment properties. This is, in effect, much like a crowdfunding campaign – 

with the distinct difference being that investors will immediately receive value for their money, in the 

form of asset-backed tokens. 

With both the November ICO and the subsequent crowdfunding campaigns – during which asset- 

backed tokens will be issued for individual projects by outside experts – REALISTO delivers a secure 

way to diversify investment portfolios of any size. REALISTO offers access to an asset class that until 

now has been largely unattainable for smaller scale investors. In addition to lowering costs and sim-

plifying cross-border transactions, our platform also lowers risk by operating only in those market-

places whose dynamics are well known to us.

This white paper provides an overview of the value proposition, economic viability, investment strategy, 

and technical functionalities of the REALISTO platform. Because security is a priority for us, this 

white paper also presents a detailed explanation of our unique trustee-wallet system, which guards 

against any misappropriation or misuse of funds. 

REALSTO offers a new, accessible way of investing in real estate, made possible by a platform with 

transparency, integrity, and industry expertise at its core.

Blockchain and Smart  
Contracts – A Brief Overview

Although cryptocurrency investors are typically familiar with the underlying blockchain technology,  

for the sake of clarity, we include a brief review of blockchain and the smart contracts it enables.

A blockchain is a type of digital ledger that is not maintained in one central location but is instead 

distributed among peers. The distributed records are kept on thousands, even millions, of individual 

computers all over the world – in contrast to the traditional form of database administered by a 

 single, central body like a bank or federal reserve. Due to the decentralized nature of the distributed 

ledger, all recorded transactions are fully traceable and virtually impervious to tampering. This decen-

tralized ledger, or blockchain, is synchronized within a given network via the internet, making all trans-

actions visible to anyone within the network. Blockchain networks can have restricted membership or 

be open to the public. Because there is no centralized body with authority over blockchain networks, 

any individual with sufficient technological knowledge and resources can set up a blockchain.

Every time a digital transaction is carried out between members of the network in question, the spe-

cifics of the transaction are compiled into a “block” that is protected by sophisticated cryptography. 

This block is bundled with other transactions occurring within the same timeframe and sent out to 

every participant in the network. Members of the network then compete for the right to validate these 

transactions by solving a complex, cryptographic puzzle, a task that requires significant computing 

power. The first member to solve the problem and complete the validation receives a reward. This 

process of competing for the right to validate a block is called mining. Each validated block receives 

a timestamp and is appended to older blocks, creating a chain of blocks that shows every single net-

work transaction in chronological order. The entire blockchain is updated every few minutes so that 

each network member’s ledger contains identical information. Because any member can prove what 

is owned by whom at any given time, the blockchain is a completely transparent and tamper-proof 

 record of transaction values and ownership.

05

Smart Contracts

One particularly promising application of blockchain technology comes in the form of “smart con-

tracts.” Smart contracts are self-fulfilling agreements between network members. Any information 

 inserted into these contracts is automatically treated according to a previously agreed upon protocol. 

Since the previously agreed-upon protocol is the sole arbiter of the transaction, the transaction can 

be carried out transparently, free of conflict, and without expensive and time-consuming middlemen. 

Traditionally, legally enforceable agreements have required the intervention of expensive lawyers and 

notaries who draft and validate contracts. The costs and delays associated with this lengthy process 

become even greater in cases where parties disagree about contractual obligations. With smart con-

tracts, agreement stipulations and enforcement functionality are already built in. This functionality 

 includes when, how, and where a given payment or return is to be made. The smart contract even 

 carries out such payments. Smart contracts both define the terms of the agreement and automatically 

enforce applicable obligations. Once deployed to the blockchain, a smart contract is given an im-

mutable address, and the deployed contract cannot be altered. That makes smart contracts a direct, 

secure way of agreeing on the exchange of money, property, shares, or practically anything of mone-

tary value.

The Ethereum blockchain is especially dedicated to the development and application of smart con-

tracts. Ethereum is an open blockchain that works as a decentralized computer, and as such, its 

source code is nonproprietary and visible to all. Although Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency (Ether 

or ETH), it also accommodates other cryptocurrencies. REALISTO adheres to the standards of the 

Ethereum blockchain and shares with Ethereum a philosophy of creating access and transparency.

Cryptocurrency Volatility

While cryptocurrencies have seen a significant increase in value in recent years, the cryptocurrency 

market has also experienced material volatility. Moreover, with governments around the world begin-

ning to focus on cryptocurrencies, volatility could be amplified as market participants react to the 

possibility of increased regulation. However, such effects are difficult to predict, and cryptocurrency 

holders are therefore advised to diversify their holdings. For example, asset-backed tokens represent 

a promising source of diversification since token values are backed by real-world assets.

Blockchain as the Future of 
Real Estate Investing 

Volatility is not the only problem that holders of cryptocurrencies face. There is also a scarcity of 

sound yet high-yielding investment opportunities, making diversification within a cryptocurrency 

 portfolio difficult. A potential solution could be found in asset-backed investments, where the token is 

collateralized by real-world assets like real estate. However, many real estate ICOs neglect to mention 

the considerable expertise required to realize material return on these investments. While many of 

those ICOs promise stakes in large projects like hotels and commercial buildings, the reality is that 

the amount of capital usually raised could cover only a small portion of the investments proposed.  

As a result, the economic viability of such ventures is questionable. However, we envision a more 

 feasible, efficient and cost-effective way of investing in tokenized real estate.

Investors Must Rely on ICOs That Know 
Their Assets and Their Reach

It is our belief that the only way forward is expertly curated, tokenized real estate investments that 

correspond to the amount of capital raised by a respective ICO. These investment properties would 

be chosen for their return on investment (ROI) potential as well as their value retention. If we are to 

establish a standard for the tokenized real estate industry, then we must look to ICOs that command 

actual real estate expertise and that can be realistically carried out with the amount of capital raised. 

As previously discussed, conventional real estate is a difficult asset class to gain access to. Those 

who do manage to invest directly in conventional real estate face administrative burdens, the possi-

bility of defaulting lessees, and the risk of damaged property. In most cases, the return does not justify 

the effort and risk of such investments. In addition, real estate is a relatively illiquid asset class, 

meaning that the capital invested is locked into the property and short-term liquidity is difficult to 

achieve. The process of liquidating real estate through conventional channels is cumbersome and 

 almost always incurs considerable cost, especially in time-constrained scenarios. Individual investors 

may turn to real estate funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) to free themselves of adminis-

trative burdens. However, in doing so, they give up control over the specific investments made, and 

they earn lower returns due to high management fees, among other things. Furthermore, REITs and 

real estate funds provide investors with little transparency on how these funds are managed. This 

seems to be to the detriment of the investor as, statistically, most real estate funds are likely to 

 default after only a short time1. For these reasons, we view the current real estate market as being 

 spectacularly inefficient when catering to the individual investor.

The Good News

The good news is that REALISTO offers a solution to the real estate investment conundrum. We do 

this by backing our tokens with expertly chosen real estate properties that are vetted, certified, and 

reliably managed. Instead of promising participation in glamourous, high-visibility projects, we con-

fine REALISTO’s activities to a marketplace that we know inside out. We use this expertise to assemble 

a core pool of real estate that truly mirrors token value. In short, we provide a way for investors to 

 escape the pitfalls of overreach while realizing above-average return on investments made. Short-

term liquidity is no longer a problem.

Thanks to blockchain technology – and its smart contracts that make transparent tokenization of real 

estate assets possible – there is now an efficient way for individuals to gain access to this highly 

 profitable and stable asset class. By creating a platform in which tokens backed by expertly chosen 

real estate assets, we address all of the above-mentioned concerns about investing in real estate 

while, at the same time, maintaining a healthy risk-return tradeoff and minimizing costs. We predict 

that blockchain technology will play a significant role in the future of the entire real estate industry. 

This future will only come to pass if care is taken to avoid unrealistic promises and establish diligent 

investment processes. For now, tokenized real estate is a way for individual investors to gain access 

to a high-yielding asset class that was previously out of reach and to add a more secure holding to 

their cryptocurrency portfolio.

Knowing Your Markets Is Key

When considering an investment in real estate-backed tokens, one major question remains: How can 

investors ensure that their capital is not poured into “duds” by platform administrators with little 

 industry knowledge? This concern can only be addressed by a platform based on industry expertise 

and a demonstrable track record in targeted markets.

If You Want Change, Be Realistic – 
and Go Step by Step

The real estate business is essentially a local affair, governed by local networks and relationships. 

Even the vast conglomerates that occasionally swoop in to buy swathes of apartment blocks or 

large-scale commercial properties spend years diligently laying the ground work. This work, which 

 requires identifying and involving the right industry players and government actors, is carried out  

by experts who know the lay of the land. Deals of that magnitude are, at present, out of reach for 

ICO-driven platforms and their crowd-investing strategies. Although this may change over time, the 

current real estate environment favors carefully curated properties whose capital requirements align 

with the amounts of capital typically raised in ICOs (a figure likely to be closer to US$10 million than 

US$100 million). High yields and stable returns in the tokenized real estate market will come not from 

glamorous yet unrealistic luxury projects but from accessible investment properties identified thanks 

to our expertise in targeted markets. 

One Last Thing: Ultimate Protection 
for the Investor

The importance of decentralization in the blockchain ecosystem bears reiteration, especially in light 

of the protection that it provides to smaller scale investors. The value that these investors own is 

stored on the blockchain, thus eliminating any uncertainty around ownership claims or contractual 

obligations that might previously have been open to interpretation.

The REALISTO vision: 
creating access for investors 
of all kinds

Many recent ICOs with asset-backed business models have emphasized the technical and the ideo-

logical aspects of crowd-investing. In doing so, they are asking their investors to blindly accept claims 

of token and asset value. We at REALISTO believe in the power of great tech but also recognize that 

deep asset knowledge is required in order to realize profit for investors. For us, blockchain is a means 

to an end, allowing us to weed out the inefficiencies of conventional real estate investing and make 

this asset class accessible to everyone. 

REALISTO offers just that: a realistic way to profitably use the breakthrough technology and ideology 

that blockchain represents. REALISTO is changing the way people participate in the global real estate 

market. We see societal value in crowd-investing as a way to democratize the investment industry. 

We seek to demonstrate this claim via our ICO, coming this November. Once launched, the REALISTO 

team of real estate experts will immediately set up and manage a portfolio. This portfolio will serve 

as a model for the future ICOs to be launched through our platform, according to the strict quality and 

fiduciary standards that we have established for ourselves. 

We at REALISTO believe that we can play a part in proving that real estate as an asset class can be 

made vastly more efficient, more transparent and more accessible. We aim to bring investor and real 

estate experts together in the most efficient and profitable way. Our goal is to effect radical change in 

this dysfunctional and insular market.

The REALISTO Real Estate 
 Investment Strategy 

The real estate market offers exceptionally high returns to investors who are diligent and have in-depth 

market knowledge. Germany in general, and Berlin in particular, have demonstrated strong and stable 

overall growth. Real estate prices in Berlin still lag behind prices in other German regions as well as 

Europe as a whole, indicating that there is significant potential for growth. Berlin real estate prices 

have steadily been rising over the past 4 years, having now reached the same level as the European 

banking capital of Frankfurt. As it stands, Berlin is well on its way to reaching the price level of Munich 

or Hamburg. Several other German cities are also currently in this state of significant undervaluation. 

The objective of our REA token ICO is to raise funds to set up the platform infrastructure and establish 

a core portfolio, which will serve as a model for the subsequent crowdfunding campaigns launched 

through the platform. With these subsequent launches, third-party emitters will issue their own asset- 

backed tokens. REALISTO will be a platform for carefully researched real estate projects, chosen by 

experts who have a commanding knowledge of their target markets. These projects will offer high-

yield returns that are otherwise unattainable to individual investors with limited capital. REALISTO’s 

name is derived from the following philosophy: Be realistic about your industry and market expertise, 

as well as the financial reach you have. 

REALISTO is the brainchild of two Berlin real estate businessmen and their network of experts. The 

founders, Rouven Rosenbaum and Leonard Zobel, have been successfully operating in the Berlin real 

estate market since 2011. REALISTO is financially independent and has no outside stakeholders that 

could influence policy or seek insider advantages. With this ICO, REALISTO seeks to build a broad 

portfolio that yields above-average return for its investors, while at the same time establishing a plat-

form for the future launch of many other real estate-backed tokens.

The founders and their team have amassed an intricate knowledge of the Berlin real estate market. They 

have created a local network comprised of key personnel in banks, institutions, and administration as 

well as large investors and on-the-ground real estate experts. A network like this is indispensable 

when seeking to operate profitably in such a complex and excessively regulated marketplace. At 

 REALISTO, a successful real estate business infrastructure is already in place – and it has proven to 

be a source of exceptional returns.

Size of Targeted Market

One might understandably ask how market expertise in a single town, Berlin, could support an entire 

token investment strategy? The answer is surprisingly simple. The Berlin real estate market boasted 

an annual transaction volume in excess of US$24 billion for 2016. That means this “local” market 

could absorb one seventh of the entire market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in existence, 

which amounts to about US$180 billion. Ether, the Ethereum cryptocurrency, has a market cap totaling 

roughly US$28 billion at the time of writing. These figures demonstrate that there is plenty of capacity 

for holders of cryptocurrency to gain exposure to the Berlin real estate market.

Market Fluidity Equals Opportunity

Berlin is an advantageous real estate market because it benefits from fluid urban development and 

zoning yet suffers from a relative scarcity of building plots. The city of Berlin is currently one of the 

most attractive European capitals, with a population steadily on the rise. As a result, the housing 

 market is under constant pressure, leading to a steady increase in prices. The current environment  

is particularly rewarding for investment strategies that rely on the discovery of opportunities that do 

not appear on the official market.  

The demand in the Berlin property market currently exceeds existing supply, for both private homes 

and condominiums. For condominiums, the market situation is strained in the districts of Friedrichs-

hain-Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. This has led to 

an increase in purchasing prices of at least 8.3% in recent years. The rental segment is experiencing 

an equally strained situation, particularly in the above-mentioned districts. As for mortgages, current 

interest rates for real estate financing in Berlin are at a historic low, resulting in an ever-increasing 

 influx of capital into the market. 

All of this taken together suggests one thing: in terms of real estate, Berlin is a veritable Boom Town. 

It also means that REALISTO is operating in the right market to realize exceptional ROI for its inves-

tors over a long investment horizon. We expect the Berlin real estate market to retain its fluidity and 

manifold opportunities in the long term thanks to continued urban development.

A Balanced Catalog of Assets

The REALISTO strategy is to compile a portfolio of several properties with a view to flip, to lease, to 

develop, or to manage and resell them. Investments will never be placed into a single, make-or-break 

project. REALISTO does not chase after prestige properties but instead seeks a diverse array of projects 

that will realistically yield steady returns. To bring this about, REALISTO dedicates substantial time 

and effort to researching and analyzing each project’s potential for tokenization. It is not uncommon 

for us to devote 100 man-hours worth of research work to an individual property. The Berlin market-

place, and real estate in general, is an insider market that cannot be understood by leafing through 

the classifieds. The REALISTO goal is to build a balanced catalog of assets that vary in their yield-to-

risk ratio. That way, token holders can allocate their tokens according to their individual investment 

needs and risk appetite.

Securing the Future: Growth and Expansion

The REALISTO platform infrastructure is designed for growth. It is ready and able to accommodate  

a diverse array of real estate projects, provided they are in line with the strict rules and requirements 

that REALISTO has established. Berlin market activities will grow as the REA token grows. In the future, 

REALISTO will also expand to other German, and possibly even European, cities. As REALISTO has 

built a database of roughly 45,000 European industry contacts, expansion is not a matter of “if” but  

of “when”. However, any expansion to another marketplace is dependent upon the quality of the local 

experts proposing to work through the REALISTO platform. The standards of research, local networks 

and financial feasibility that REALISTO has established for its Berlin-based projects will equally apply 

to projects in new marketplaces.

The REALISTO ICO

REA: The REALISTO Token 

A capped pre-sale of the REA token will start on November 7, 2017 and end on November 14, 2017 –

with a minimum contribution of 5 ETH at a 30% discount rate. The REA token sale will be conducted 

via smart contract, fully audited by Coinfabrik.

The uncapped, public ICO of REA tokens will start on November 15, 2017 and end on December 15, 

2017 – with an initial discount of 15%. The discount rate will be lowered in increments of 5% percent 

over the duration of the 30-day sale, with the latest stage of the sale offering no discount. In any case, 

we expect that tokens acquired during the ICO will be heavily discounted against subsequent trading 

values of REA tokens in secondary markets. Minimal contribution in the public ICO is set at 0.01 ETH. 

We explain our rationale for an uncapped ICO further below. 

The proceeds from the ICO will be split via smart contract in the following manner: 90% of the funds 

will be used to fund acquisition of assets and 10% will go to the operational fund that covers all oper-

ational costs.

Why No Hard Cap?

REALISTO has opted for a “no hard cap” ICO format because we see no reason to limit the opportunity 

for our investors to acquire high-yield real estate. In the real estate business, the more capital one 

can deploy, the more diverse and stable the portfolio will be. We are fully aware of the reputation that 

some “no hard cap” ICOs have garnered. However, REALISTO will use only 10% of the capital raised to 

remunerate the team, develop the platform, conduct sales and marketing initiatives, and cover legal 

and auditing costs. That means 90% of the capital will be used to fund Core Pool and Opportunity 

Pool portfolios. Therefore, we are confident that our integrity is not compromised by opting for a to-

ken sale with no hard cap. Furthermore, a hard cap could potentially lead to “race conditions” that un-

duly privilege those with deeper pockets.

22

For our pre-sale, on the other hand, we have decided to apply a hard cap. This is due to the fact that 

our tokens are asset-backed; the more REA tokens we hand out for free as a pre-sale bonus, the less 

funds – in relation to tokens generated – we will have to buy assets. Our pre-sale is meant for investors 

who are convinced of the feasibility of the REALISTO concept and are willing to commit substantial 

amounts to the project right off the bat, for a 30% discount. Everyone else will still be rewarded with a 

15% bonus in the first week of the ICO.

Three Kinds of Value

The REALISTO ICO will serve to crowdfund our new platform and launch the first asset-backed token 

issued from that platform. With the first half of the 90% of capital raised, REALISTO will set up a Core 

Pool of expertly selected, high-quality residential and commercial real estate assets. These assets 

will generate steady returns for users who plan to hold their tokens and watch the intrinsic value 

grow. The second half of the 90% of capital raised will be used for an Opportunity Pool, where more 

active investors can vote for the acquisition of real estate projects of different risk-to-yield ratios. 

 Investors will vote by allocating their tokens according to their investment strategies. 

A third source of profit for REA token holders comes from REALISTO’s platform-as-a-service, which 

helps emitters to set up their crowdfunding campaigns for a fee. REA token holders will be given a 

70% share of the profits made from these fees. At the same time, real estate crowd-investing is be-

coming more and more attractive to investors. As tokenized real estate investment via blockchain be-

comes more popular, we expect real estate experts to increasingly turn to platforms, like REALISTO, 

that provide a stable infrastructure for capitalizing their projects. This increased activity suggests 

healthy prospects for our third source of value.

How Does the REALISTO Team Make Their Profit?

The REALISTO team will take 2.5% of the returns realized by the Core Pool and the Opportunity Pool. 

This is to remunerate the team for curating, administrating, managing, and developing the real estate 

assets. 

The REALISTO team will take 30% of the fees generated by offering the platform to real estate experts 

for their own individual ICOs. This is to remunerate the team for managing and administrating the 

platform, maintaining the infrastructure, conducting emitter due diligence, managing issuances and 

crowdfunding campaigns, developing projects, marketing, and acquiring new projects. 

10% of the REA tokens minted in the ICO will go to the REALISTO team. The tokens will be locked in 

for 12 months, thereby incentivizing the team to develop the platform to its fullest potential.

How the REALISTO 
Platform Works

Two Kinds of Users: Investors and Emitters 

The REALISTO platform is designed to service two different kinds of users. First, there are the inves-

tors who wish to invest their cryptocurrency capital into tokens that enable them to participate in the 

platform’s real estate projects. Second, there are the emitters who use the REALISTO platform to 

 issue their own asset-backed tokens. REALISTO will use half of the capital raised in the November 

2017 ICO (minus 10% for the operational fund) to establish a core portfolio of real estate, acquired  

at the team’s own expert discretion. This will be called the REALISTO Core Pool. The other half of the 

capital raised will be used to set up the REALISTO Opportunity Pool, where real estate investment 

projects will be presented to investors so that they may vote on acquisition via token allocation. 

Therefore, the REALISTO Core Pool and the REALISTO Opportunity Pool will be the first two projects 

on the platform – built with 90% of the capital raised in the November REA token sale.

REALISTO aims to bring the interests of investors and emitters together in the most efficient and  reliable 

way. We expect many crowdfunding campaigns to be launched through our platform by carefully vetted 

real estate experts. Every one of the future token emissions launched by other real estate experts 

through the REALISTO platform will adhere to the same exacting standards and business principles laid 

down in this paper. This means that REA investors will benefit from the profits made by the Core Pool 

and Opportunity Pool as well as the profits that come from the REALISTO platform-as-a-service. 

 
REAL ESTATE CROWD INVESTING MARKET GROWTH

Real estate crowd funding grew by 156% in 2014, valued at US $ 1 bln. In 2016, it grew to $4.0 billion, making it one of the fastest growing branches of 
the crowdfunding sector. Based on 1st quarter projections real estate crowd funding will reach US $ 5.5bln by the end of 2017. According to World Bank 
predictions, the entire crowd-funding industry will value at US $ 93 bln by 2025.

The REALISTO Contract Structure

The smart contracts used by REALISTO are distributed applications on the Ethereum network. These 

smart contracts are written in the Solidity programming language and are compiled to byte code for 

the Ethereum VM.

The system of smart contracts created and employed by REALISTO is run via a Controller App, which 

is a front end for contract administration. Its main tasks are to provide a way to deploy tokens to the 

Ethereum network and to trigger contract functions such as “start,” “pause,” “finalize,” and “transfer.”

REALISTO USES FIVE DIFFERENT SMART CONTRACTS

RealistoToken.sol Our token, the REA, is based well tested MiniMe implementation of the ERC20 
standard. As such, it allows for the standard operations of querying balance, 
transferring, and setting spending allowance. Additionally, it implements the 
function “generate_tokens_for,” which may be called only by the Campaign 
Controller (see below). 

MiniMeToken.sol Auxiliary contract, part of the MiniMe implementation. It is used to implement 
the cloning of the tokens. Not specific to our case. 

TokenCampaign.
sol

The Campaign Controller is the contract that accepts ETH from an address 
and triggers token generation via "generate_tokens_for" function of the Token 
contract. Additionally CampaignController allows generation of Tokens with-
out incoming ETH for BTC contributors. This function is controlled by our BTC 
payment processing backend which also logs all activities related to token 
generation. The function “finalize” computes the team share and generates 
team tokens. This function may only be called upon when the crowd sale is 
over. It is possible to pause the crowd sale at any time in case of emergency.

LinearToken-
Vault.sol

TeamVault holds the team tokens. It is programmed to lock the tokens  
for a year to prevent the team from dumping tokens and only allows for 
controlled spending of tokens. 

ROI 
 Disbursement 
Contract

PayDividend is a smart contract that is not part of the ICO stage but will be 
deployed later when returns are to be disbursed from the trustee wallet to 
token holders.



0 8 •  H O W T H E R E A L I S TO P L AT F O R M W O R K S

28

The REALISTO Platform Escrow System 

To keep investor money safe and diligently manage emitter capital, the REALISTO platform holds all 

working funds in an escrow wallet. This means that the platform funds are kept in escrow until the 

real estate experts of a given ICO show valid proof of purchase for the real estate project in question. 

ROI is disbursed only if the applicable smart contracts are triggered. 

In addition to transparently controlling the platform’s flow of capital, the  REALISTO system also of-

fers another important feature: the Data Room. The Data Room will be administered independently 

from the REALISTO platform, set up by a notary public. This Data Room may be visited by investors 

and emitters at any time. It will provide access to bank statements, real-world contracts pertaining to 

the purchase and sale of real estate, protocols exchanging tokens and cryptocurrency for fiat money 

(to purchase assets), and other pertinent financial statements. The Data Room thus provides an ac-

curate and ongoing report of all activities, maintaining the full transparency that is essential to the 

REALISTO proposition.

Security Considerations 

THE REALISTO SECURITY SYSTEM RESTS ON THREE PILLARS  

• Real-world security pertaining to assets (real estate properties and projects) 

• Fiduciary security of capital flows 

• Tech security

With regard to real-world security, REALISTO is working with some of the largest and most well-

known insurers to acquire comprehensive insurance on all real estate assets in the portfolio. In 

 Germany, we are legally required to insure buildings and structures against any liabilities that may 

originate from ownership. In addition, REALISTO will also acquire comprehensive insurance against 

damage by natural disaster and acts of god, a term that refers to freak accidents with no discernible 

party at fault.

Regarding fiduciary duties, access to the REALISTO platform funds is multi-signature, meaning that 

several parties must approve of each transaction by signature. Any transferal of monies can only be 

initiated upon presentation of proof of purchase, thereby preventing misappropriation of funds.

To ensure tech security, we have our smart contracts audited by CoinFabrik and tested extensively on 

Testnet and Livenet. REALISTO platform data is stored on a dedicated server and secured according 

to state-of-the-art protocols. User accounts and wallets will be secured by two- factor authentication. 

All funds are stored in air-gapped cold storage.

The REALISTO Tech Stack

Necessary Limits of Full Tech Disclosure

Because we do not wish to provide ready-made gateways for hackers, we must limit the disclosure of 

the tech involved in running the REALISTO platform. Therefore, the specifics of our system architecture 

will remain confidential in order to provide protection for our platform and our users. On the other 

hand, the smart contracts that we use for business with our investors and emitters are open source 

and can be viewed and audited by anyone.

The REALISTO App –  
Managing Your Investment

Investors can manage their accounts and execute investment decisions through the REALISTO 

 platform app. The REALISTO app connects investors to the blockchain, using the applicable smart 

contracts. The user wallets are thus blockchain wallets: all information pertaining to investments, 

 tokens, and the value they carry is recorded in the immutable ledger of the blockchain. 

The platform works as a mobile app and as a web application accessed through your browser. 

 REALISTO aims to provide user-friendly access to the investment opportunities presented on our 

platform. 

All platform interface functions are designed to serve clearly defined purposes. Any background 

 activity is only executed to serve a specific purpose. REALISTO does not collect data about or from 

their users beyond the data necessary for execution of investments and disbursement. Data will 

 never be passed on to third parties for commercial reasons. Any technical changes or development 

phases will always be explained in full at the earliest possible time. Therefore, you can use the 

 REALISTO platform confident in the knowledge that your privacy is being protected.

Regulatory Terms

The REALISTO ICO has been initiated by the Realisto GmbH based in Germany (Fritz-Jäger-Allee 16 in 

15086 Zossen, just outside Berlin). The company’s office address is Pariser Strasse 61, 10719 Berlin. 

The company operates as a limited liability company, largely similar to the Anglo-Saxon LLC model. 

Its share capital amounts to €25,000. The company’s commercial register number is HRB 28456 P, 

and its registry court is the Potsdam district court. 

According to prevailing legal opinion, ICOs of the nature planned by REALISTO are not subject to 

 supervision or subject to permission under German law. In terms of existing German law, the ICO  

is not considered to be a deposit business, nor will there be any own-account trading. No laws 

 pertaining to legal tender or legal currency are applicable in this case, nor does German law consider 

tokens of the REALISTO kind a “security.”

The REALISTO business venture is entirely legal and compliant with existing German law. However, a 

REALISTO ICO would be subject to prospectus requirements under German law and the laws of several 

other countries. As this involves lengthy procedures that would take at least one year to complete, 

REALISTO has opted to forgo said procedures at this stage. This means that citizens and residents of 

Germany, the United States of America, the People’s Republic of China, and the Republic of Singapore 

are not eligible to participate in the REALISTO ICO. 

The REALISTO Platform Is, and Will Be, 
Compliant with Existing Regulation

Should pertinent regulations change in the foreseeable future, REALISTO will immediately comply 

with said regulations. Furthermore, REALISTO will make investors and emitters fully aware of any 

consequences stemming from new regulations and subsequent compliance.
