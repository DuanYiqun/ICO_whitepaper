Introduction 

Despite its rapidly growing value—with total capitalization now well over the 100 
billion USD mark—the cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy. While 
blockchain technologies have already made significant impacts in such areas as 
business, finance, information management, and governance, it is clear that their 
full disruptive/transformative potential has barely begun to be realized. 
Accordingly, they can be expected to play an increasingly crucial role in many 
areas of modern life. 

A number of different protocols can be employed to ensure blockchain safety. 
These include proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-activity, proof-of-space, 
and proof-of-bandwidth, to name just a few. Of these, proof-of-work is currently 
the most widely used—underpinning such currencies as Bitcoin, Ethereum and 
Ethereum Classic, or Litecoin—and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. It 
is a distributed consensus system dependent on the participation of “miners,” 
who, through their work (or, more precisely, the work performed by their 
computers), guarantee the integrity and security of blockchain transactions. 

At the risk of oversimplification—the more miners, the more secure the network. 

Becoming a miner, however, is not an easy process. First, suitable hardware has to 
be acquired and assembled, individual components carefully selected with an eye 
towards performance, power consumption, and price. The equipment then needs 
to be properly configured. This may involve not only determining and applying 
appropriate settings, but also more radical interventions, such as BIOS flashing. 
Third, suitable mining software must be obtained and set up. It must be noted 
that every currency requires different software and different settings. Once 
operational, a mining machine has to be monitored and maintained. This includes 
tweaking its operating parameters, installing updates, troubleshooting problems, 
and so forth. On top of everything else, miners also have to worry about keeping 
their mines profitable. This can be quite a challenge with just a single machine—let 
alone with tens or hundreds of them. 

For the above reasons, relatively few people decide to enter the cryptocurrency 
mining business.

The Idea 

The core idea behind easyMINE can be expressed in a single phrase: plug & mine. 

easyMINE is designed to simplify and streamline the process of setting up, 
expanding, and managing a cryptocurrency mine. It will provide a complete 
software solution for easy setup and maintenance of mining equipment. 

easyMINE is aimed at both complete beginners, interested in launching their first 
mining machine, and experienced miners, who will appreciate the increased 
efficiency and control our solution can bring to their mining operations. 

Our goal is to deliver a system that—while fully featured, versatile, and powerful—
will be intuitive and straightforward enough to be readily accessible to a 
layperson. We believe that with easyMINE, anyone will be able to participate in 
and profit from cryptocurrency mining. 

Principles of Operation 

The functionalities provided by easyMINE fall into three general areas: automatic 
configuration, automatic mining, and comprehensive mine management. 

On the first boot-up, the eMOS system will take over and automatically execute 
the necessary set-up and optimization routines. This may involve GPU BIOS 
flashing, GPU core voltage adjustment, CPU/GPU/memory clock frequency 
adjustment, and so on. All operating parameters will be preselected from the 
central “knowledge base” of configuration and performance data, and then further 
optimized in order to achieve maximum stability and efficiency.  

In the fully automatic mode, easyMINE will be capable of operating without 
human input or supervision. It will dynamically optimize hardware and software 
settings, based on the given device’s own performance history, as well as on 
performance data obtained from other units. It will also automatically select the 
most profitable currency (based on current exchange rates, block difficulty, power 
consumption, etc.) and the best available mining pool (considering, for instance, 
network delays and congestion). Lastly, the system will be able to manage the 
mined funds, performing currency conversions and depositing the profits to 
appropriate wallets. 

For advanced users, seeking complete control over every facet of their mining 
business, easyMINE’s manual mode will offer a full range of configuration and 

v. 2.1 easymine.io �4



administration tools. Planned functionalities include: real-time hardware 
monitoring, inventory management, complete operating history, detailed 
performance analysis, profitability calculation, report generation, diagnostics, and 
task automation. All settings and features will be accessible through a web-based 
dashboard or a dedicated mobile app (available for iOS and Android). 

The complete software package will be available for download from the 
easyMINE website. The eMOS operating system distribution will be released 
under an OpenSource license, with core functionalities available free of charge. 
Access to the more advanced autoconfiguration and hardware monitoring 
features will be paid. The fee amount will be dependent on the output of the 
devices under the system’s control. 

Platform Architecture  

The easyMINE platform consists of the following modules: 

easyMINE OS (eMOS) 
A custom Linux distribution optimized specifically towards cryptocurrency mining. 
Includes all necessary system components, GPU drivers, pre-installed mining 
software for a variety of currencies, and an easyMINE script package for hardware 
management and communication with the easyMINE server. Developed under an 
open source license. 

easyMINE Server 
The main module of the platform. Controls the operation of individual mining 
machines. Relies on AI-based performance optimization algorithms to adjust 
hardware settings (BIOS version, core voltage, clock frequency, etc.) and mining 
parameters (currency, pool, etc.). Collects performance data and makes it available 
to users. 

easyMINE Dashboard 
Administrative module. An online configuration and management interface, 
accessible via web browser. Enables remote monitoring of and control over mining 
machines connected to the easyMINE server. 

v. 2.1 easymine.io �5



easyMINE Mobile 
Administrative module. A dedicated mobile application for iOS and Android 
devices. Allows for remote management of mining machines connected to the 
easyMINE server. 

Additional, minor modules may be developed to support additional functionalities 
dependent on special-purpose hardware (e.g. remote hard reset). 

The easyMINE Difference 

At the moment, no comparable mine management platforms are available. 
easyMINE’s extensive and unique feature set places it apart from—and, we 
believe, ahead of—any existing solutions, commercial as well as non-commercial.  

Complete 
The easyMINE distribution package will include all the software needed to run a 
profitable mine: the eMOS operating system, hardware drivers, mining programs, 
and the eM dashboard. No additional purchases, downloads, or installations will 
be necessary. 

Easy to use 
For people new to the world of cryptocurrencies, the very concepts of 
“blockchain,” “proof,” or “hash” can be hard to grasp. easyMINE aims to be 
accessible even to complete beginners and will require no more than intermediate 
computer skills for successful basic operation. 

Comprehensive 
From a single remote dashboard, easyMINE will provide access to and precise 
control over every aspect of a mining operation: from initial set-up, to inventory 
management, to performance monitoring and optimization, to troubleshooting 
and maintenance.  

Near-autonomous 
With easyMINE, every step of the mining process can be fully or partially 
automated. At its most autonomous, the system will rely on an array of self-
configuration, self-optimization, and self-management algorithms to operate with 
no—or minimal—user supervision.  

v. 2.1 easymine.io �6



Self-learning 
Advanced machine learning and data mining techniques will allow easyMINE to 
dynamically fine-tune its operating parameters for maximum efficiency. Optimal 
values will be determined through analysis of performance data collected in a 
centrally maintained knowledge base. “Lessons” derived from any given mining 
machine will be applied to improve the functioning of other similarly configured 
units.  

Scalable and extensible 
Designed to provide a consistent level of usability and convenience regardless of 
the number of mining machines under its control, easyMINE is suitable for small, 
growing, and moderately large mines. In addition, it can be easily extended to 
support new currencies, mining algorithms, wallets, etc. 

Our Goals 

Within the scope of the easyMINE project, we intend to: 

1. Build a complete software package needed to run a mining machine. The 
software will be based on a dedicated operating system distribution and 
ready to install to a USB flash drive. It will enable remote configuration 
and administration of mining hardware. 

2. Develop a dedicated mining machine management platform. The platform 
will allow users to inventory their hardware, configure it, and control its 
operation. It will automatically select and apply optimal configuration 
settings (BIOS modifications, CPU/GPU/memory timings, etc.) and 
respond to malfunctions and errors. 

3. Create intuitive and easy-to-use access interfaces for hardware 
monitoring and control. A web-based dashboard and a dedicated mobile 
application (for iOS and Android devices) are planned. 

4. Build a hardware specification and configuration knowledge base—for the 
purpose of automating the performance optimization process. 

5. Provide configuration presets for a wide variety of mining setups and 
cryptocurrencies. 

6. Develop automatic currency and mine selection algorithms. 
7. Establish new, dedicated cryptocurrency mining pools. 

v. 2.1 easymine.io �7



8. Create a wallet mechanism (in order to make first steps easier for beginner 
miners). 

9. Introduce a cryptocurrency trading functionality—tracking exchange rates 
for different currency pairs. 

10. Provide a sales platform that will allow third parties to distribute hardware 
components as well as pre-built mining machines. 

At a later date, we also want to develop hardware solutions that will simplify mine 
management for users operating a large number of mining machines (remote 
restart devices, PXE servers, etc.). 

easyMINE Tokens (EMT) 

To fund the project, we will issue 33,000,000 easyMINE tokens (EMT). The 
tokens will be based on the Ethereum (ETH) platform and managed using existing 
ETH solutions, such as MyEtherWallet. 

The token pool will be divided as follows: 

• Crowdsale participants: 27,000,000 EMT (approx. 81.8%) 

• Pre-ICO buyer bonuses: 2,000,000 EMT (approx. 6.1%) 
• easyMINE development team: 1,500,000 EMT (approx. 4.6%) 

• Project advisors: 500,000 EMT (approx. 1.5%)  
• Bounty program: 1,000,000 EMT (approx. 3.0%) 

• easyMINE Corporation: 1,000,000 EMT (approx. 3.0%)  

Unsold tokens will be burned. No additional tokens will be created at any point 
during or after the sale. Tokens allocated to the development team, project 
advisors, and easyMINE Corporation will have a 180-day vesting period, after 
which they will be released to holders at the rate of 0.5% a day. 

EMT tokens will be listed on exchanges in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

EMT tokens will be used as the sole form of payment for easyMINE services. 
easyMINE users will make prepayments to their individual EMT accounts. Fees for 
easyMINE services will then be automatically deducted from the account balance.  

easyMINE Corporation will continue to burn part of EMT tokens received in 
payment for its services until only 3,000,000 remain in circulation. 

v. 2.1 easymine.io �8



Initial Coin Offering 

27,000,000 EMT tokens will be offered to the public through a crowdsale. The 
sale will continue until one of the following conditions is met: 

a) 21,300 ETH is collected, or 
b) 27,000,000 EMT tokens are sold, or 
c) 200,000 blocks are added to the ETH blockchain (i.e. approx. 34 days have 

elapsed). 

Token price will change throughout the sale period depending on the total 
amount sold: 

Tier 1: up to 2,000,000 EMT sold  1 EMT=0.0007 ETH 
Tier 2: 2,000,001–4,000,000 EMT sold 1 EMT=0.00075 ETH 
Tier 3: 4,000,001–27,000,000 EMT sold 1 EMT=0.0008 ETH 

Tokens will be released to buyers immediately upon purchase. Unsold tokens will 
be burned.  

The ICO smart contract code will be made publicly available on GitHub prior to 
the beginning of the sale. 

The crowdsale contract address and starting ETH block number will be 
announced on easyMINE’s official website.
