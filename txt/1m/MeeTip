Offering. By getting in early, you will have the chance to

FEATURES

6



7

A virtual bracelet indicates the sentimental 

status of people who surround you.

7



With MeeTip

offer a drink and tip!

With our ‘Drink’ functionality, offer a drink to a 

single person around you or to your friends, 

even if they are at the other end of the world.

Tip the employee of your choice with our ‘Tip’ 

function.

These two functionalities will be usable with MeeTip, the 

cryptocurrency embedded into OutMySphere using the 

Ethereum BlockChain.

8



We plan to completely decentralize by using already existing blockchain

applications. All data will be stored on the blockchain in the Q4 2018 and will 

replace our MongoDB database, as stated in our roadmap.

The MeeTip wallet will contain your coins and will be accessible from a web 

browser. In addition, a wallet will be assigned to every user of OutMySphere

within the app in order to take full advantage of Drink and Tip functionalities. 

The launch of MeeTip wallet is planned on june 2018.

Messasing service allows you to chat with people around you and your 

friends. You will also have the ability to instantly send MeeTip to them. To 

protect privacy, end-to-end message encryption will be integrated. With this, 

only you and the person you are communicating with can read what is sent, 

and nobody in between, not even us.

The ‘Drink’ functionality usable in establishments such as bars allows you to 

offer the ‘friendship cocktail’ to your Facebook friends who are in a bar, and 

also to offer the ‘cocktail of love’ to the man or woman you care about when 

you are in the same establishment. The person concerned is free to accept or 

decline the invitation. 

With the ‘Tip’ functionality, you will be able to tip the employee of your choice, 

whether it be the waiter, the barman or even the cook. Simply click on the 

establishment in which you are, choose the desired employee and pay the 

amount you want with your wallet containing your MeeTip. In practice, it is 

immediate and free of charge.

9



Currently, we account for more than 95% of bars, restaurants and coffees around 

the world in OutMySphere.

We are working to create an accessible customer area for each owner of these 

establishments. The owners of the establishments will be able to claim from the 

mobile application, we will simply send them a mail containing a unique code that 

has to be entered in OutMySphere to activate their customer area.

This area will allow bars owners to indicate the price in MeeTip of the ‘friendship 

cocktail’ and the ‘cocktail of love’. When ordering, the establishment will instantly 

see the ordered consumption, the first name and the photo of the person who 

ordered and the beneficiary. All glasses purchases will be first sent through a 

master account controlled by OutMySphere, 1% fee will be taken, and the rest will 

be forwarded to the establishment MeeTip wallet.

With this area, bar owners, restaurants and cafes will be able to register their 

employees so that they can receive tips from OutMySphere users thanks to MeeTip. 

This will encourage all employees in these establishments to use OutMySphere to 

receive these tips and to promote them to the client. Payments are made directly 

between the MeeTip wallets of OutMySphere users and employees, so it is without 

intermediaries and without fees.

Furthermore, this area will also allow the owners of these different types of 

establishments to display their menu as well as their prices.

At first, only the cocktail of love and the friendship cocktail will be offered for 

payment with MeeTip in the bars. Afterwards, the bar managers and even 

restaurants and cafes will be able to sell all their consumption in MeeTip thanks to 

the menu that they have informed, thus the orders and payments will be completely 

decentralized.

TECHNICAL

10



Blockchain :

OutMySphere will use two existing blockchains for MeeTip transfers and data 

storage.

- Transfers :
As MeeTip is an ERC20 based Ethereum token, it is logical that Ethereum will be 

used for all transactions within OutMySphere and transfers between MeeTip

wallets.

- Data Storage :
Database storage will rely on BigchainDB. We found that BigchainDB had the best 

technology, fastest blockchain write speeds and seamless integrations. As stated 

above, this decision may change before implementation if a better decentralized 

database solution arises. 

Currently we only offer one use of the application per Facebook connection. When 

switching to the BigchainDB blockchain, we will also offer a classic account 

creation for connection.

On-Selling :

All MeeTip that OutMySphere makes via the fee and that the bar owners receive 

after the sale of glasses will be on-sold via OutMySphere. MeeTip will be sold for 

ETH, BTC or via EUR / USD from a credit card. The rate of MeeTip will be the last 

three days high + 1%. This will ensure the constant rise of MeeTip price.

Once a bar owner has sold a MeeTip, he can keep the buyer's cryptocurrency or 

ask us for a conversion, we will then pay for it by wire transfer.

Thanks to the buy-back program (see below), we will bring liquidity to the launch of 

the application and its 'Drink' and 'Tip‘ functionalities in selling MeeTip to 

OutMySphere users, in addition to those offered to the first 75,000 users.

Buy Back Program :

Instead of allocating MeeTip to the team during the ICO period, we will be 

launching a buy-back program on the exchange. This way, MTIP will be purchased 

with BTC instead of being allocated free of charge to team members. A total of 

15% of all MTIP in circulation will be purchased back by our company during the 

first 24 hours on first exchange to help MeeTip entering a bullish trend.

11



Our first challenge is establishments solicitation to let them know about 

OutMySphere and its features so that they can embrace and use the concept. 

We are confident insofar as the market research carried out in different countries 

shows very positive feedback on our concept and will be helped by an advisor 

specialized in targeted proximity advertising with its patented technology.

At this time, we have concluded more than 700 use agreements with bars, 

mainly in the Paris region and Hauts-de-France.

In addition to the usual drinks of each bar, the managers will be able to propose 

the ‘cocktail of love’ and the ‘friendship cocktail’. These drinks created by the 

OutMySphere founder (former manager of bars and restaurants) will be the 

symbol of the 'Drink‘ functionality for romantic and friendly meetings.

These recipes are ready to be offered to all bars around the world.

12



In various countries, we have conducted a market survey with bar owners, as well as 

people who often go there, to get feedback on the features of OutMySphere.

SMART CONTRACT

MTIP alias MeeTip is a token issued with an Ethereum smart contract. 

We are raising funds through the issue of our MTIP token. These proceeds will be 

used to fund OutMySphere SAS company.

MTIP can be held on ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallets such as MyEtherWallet, 

MetaMask, Mist or soon in our own wallet (Q2 of 2018).

Our smart contract is set to only mint tokens when receiving ETH. Therefore, there 

will be no unsold coins remaining after the ICO has been finalized. Our ICO structure 

will perform an immediate exchange of MeeTip coins from your contributed Ether. 

We have set a minimum funding goal for the crowdsale. If the minimum goal is not 

set, full refunds will be made via the smart-contract. If the main ICO does not pass 

the minimum specified, all remaining pre-ICO funds are returned to the investors 

minus marketing expenses.

90% of all coins are available for purchase during the crowdsale. 

1.5M other tokens are sent to a second address of the company for the bounty 

program. If all the tokens are not distributed for the bounty program, they will be 

destroyed with the 'burn()' function.

Our smart contract has been audited, you can check its code here : 

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1cce4079a9c65920390ea38d5ffbeeb3f4aaab77#code

Bonus rates during ICO :



We are raising money to develop OutMySphere.

- First, we will continue the rebuild of the app in native language on iOS and 

Android and improve its design to make it more 'friendly'. Then, we will 

integrate the wallet into the app to activate the 'Drink' and 'Tip' features. 

Several new developers will be hired.

- In parallel, we will tackle the marketing with establishments solicitation. We will 

focus our campaign on targeted advertising, helped by Proxistore (see 

Advisors) to reach the owners of bars, restaurants and cafes. We will also 

promote the mobile app on different media such as social networks and TV 

advertising.

- Finally, we will work on replacing our MongoDB database with the BigchainDB

blockchain in order to decentralize the data storage.

ICO GOAL

WHY CONTRIBUTE

The number of MeeTip coins is limited to 30,000,000 and no further coins could be 

created due to the strict laws of smart-contracts.

All coins sold within the pre-ICO and main ICO will be the only MeeTip ever in 

circulation. Once OutMySphere is complete and integrates MeeTip coins, the 

demand of MeeTip will increase, as more people demand it as a form of payment 

for glasses and tip.

Due to our buy-back program, the chances of MeeTip entering a bullish market 

once it hits an exchange is high. If the bullish trend sticks, the price of MeeTip

should steadily increase.

Bonus rates are offered for every period of the ICO. For the contributor, 

participating during the ICO it means he will receive the base rate of 1 ETH = 600 

MTIP plus the current bonus in effect.

Be the first to own MTIP and join this revolution about meetings and tips.

HOW CONTRIBUTE

There are strict rules and precautions to follow while participating within the MeeTip

ICO.

• Send ETH from your personal Ethereum wallet such as MyEtherWallet, 

Metamask, Mist, Parity, Ledger or any personal wallet.

• Do not send funds from exchanges like Bittrex, Poloniex, Kraken etc.

• Do not send your funds before the crowdsale has begun.

• MTIP will be immediately sent to the wallet from which the ETH came from. 

Exchange :

We have prepared all required documentation to be listed on exchanges. We are 

currently talking with two exchanges and plan to be listed on at least one major 

exchange one month after the end of the ICO.

Technology :

In the future, in addition of affluence measuring, we would like to 

measure the atmosphere in each establishment. For the users 

authorizing it, in using the microphone of the phone, we will make a 

sound measurement of about 10 seconds analyzing several criteria: 

the intensity, the pitch, the rhythm, the timbre of the sounds etc. This is 

invisible for the user and does not alter its use of the application.

This technology is under development. The first tests will be carried 

out in the Q3 of 2018. This technology will be generalized at the end of 

2018 / early 2019.

Company Information :

OutMySphere SAS is a fully compliant and registered company based in France 

since 2015.
