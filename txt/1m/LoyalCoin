APPSOLUTELY 
THE COMPANY USHERING IN THE NEW LOYALTY ECONOMY 

 
Appsolutely, formed in 2013 in the Philippines, has launched digital platforms and 
mobile apps that have enabled companies of all sizes, including some with top global 
brands, to rapidly expand market share and accelerate growth by providing richer, 
more satisfying customer experiences through loyalty and rewards programs.  

Building on our expertise in loyalty and rewards programs, we are launching a new, 
unified customer loyalty ecosystem that uses blockchain technology as the backbone 
and the LoyalCoin digital asset as the medium of exchange. With these innovations, 
we are eliminating the customer loyalty programs’ limitations we currently encounter, 
such as public confusion about the different mechanics of each loyalty program, 
difficulties in points exchange, lack of user engagement, and more. Removing these 
problems will accelerate the formation of a more cohesive, cooperative, and 
competitive customer loyalty industry. 

The launch of LoyalCoin will involve commitments from entities who will have the 
digital asset and use it for consumption, operational, and/or other purposes. 
Participants in this new ecosystem will drive the new loyalty economy with their 
activities and financial support for the scaling of our platform. For instance, in the 
consumption-driven emerging economies in Asia, the spread of a unified, proactive 
customer loyalty system can usher in more customer retention for companies, who 
will then boost their top and bottom lines. Mass adoption and economic activity from 
this dynamic loyalty environment will be the engine that can add value to each 
LoyalCoin.  

Simply put, by replacing the limited reward points in the current customer loyalty 
setup with a blockchain-backed dynamic currency that supports increased 
participation between customer and brand, we can unlock the full potential of 
rewards programs and increased value for participants in this revamped loyalty 
ecosystem.  

In the succeeding parts of this whitepaper, we will illustrate the roles that our 
company, the technology, and the digital asset will play in this new ecosystem, as well 

�3



as the value proposition of LoyalCoin as an important part of building the new loyalty 
economy we envision. 

TRACK RECORD 
Our proprietary technology for white label digital loyalty apps allowed us to launch 
the country’s first mobile-based customer loyalty system in 2014, a crucial 
development given that the nation is one of the world’s most savvy and active when it 
comes to mobile services, particularly apps and social media.   1

This technology has opened opportunities for business collaborations with companies 
in multiple industries, as well as international recognition. We became the trusted 
loyalty system provider for our home country’s biggest brands. Our work in the digital 
loyalty space has won us the Best Technology Investment Award  in 2015 at the 2

Technology Investment Conference organized by Software Park Thailand. 

THE OMNICHANNEL FUTURE 
Companies worldwide have set out to aim for an omnichannel rewards strategy that 
shows consistency in service, branding and customer experience, regardless of where 
brands and consumers meet. An omnichannel reward program is a lofty goal, one that 
involves a huge amount of collaboration among brands and the channels by which 
they connect. Difficulty increases as more channels are added and companies enter 
into agreements to arrange rewards and promotions. 

Given our extensive experience in addressing brands’ needs for reaching out to 
customers, we are uniquely positioned to understand, develop and implement a wide-
reaching platform that allows for a universal loyalty points system, which is a 
fundamental concept for the LoyalCoin tokens we will be issuing.

SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO 
Appsolutely provides an Internet-based bridge that connects brands and merchants 
to their customers and audiences. Our offerings have a unifying theme — better 
customer service. 

The main service we provide, and the focus of our push into 
blockchain, is digital loyalty. Through our customizable 
digital rewards programs, companies were able to offer 
incentives such as coupons, freebies, promos, as well as 
points and token-based digital assets that encourage 
customer loyalty and continued business.  

From there, we expanded the use of digital loyalty to innovations that allow for the 
interaction with digital loyalty programs offline, the synchronization of online and 
offline activities related to rewards and the creation of employee rewards programs. 
In addition, in our drive to cater to clients’ desire for omnichannel solutions, we 
launched the following services:  
 

Digital Marketing. We offer tailor-made, Internet-based, 
optimized ad campaign strategies, CRM data, and consumer 
behavior reports. This service ensures the consistency of a 
brand’s messaging.  
 

E-commerce. One goal of our loyalty programs is to increase 
Internet-based consumption. Over the past years, we have 
integrated online ordering systems, electronic gift cards, and 
digital wallet offerings into website and app-driven loyalty 
programs, creating a one-stop platform for connecting 
brands to customers. 

�5



Logistics. With the online ordering system in place, we go 
the extra mile to ensure that orders are delivered promptly 
and that brands’ services are consistent. Our addition of a 
logistics arm allows us to serve an end-to-end solution that 
handles every step of engagement, from promotions and 
incentives to orders and deliveries. 

Web and App Development. Given that the loyalty 
programs we create are based on mobile apps and websites, 
we parlayed our capabilities into serving clients’ other 
platform creation needs, taking advantage of the insights we 
have about the best practices for creating mobile apps and 
websites. 

We evolved from digital loyalty specialist to omnichannel solutions provider. 
Unfortunately, rewards points in general have yet to make that evolutionary leap. 
Rewards points, the medium of exchange of any loyalty program, has been limited 
due to the complications that come with arranging eligible deals for those rewards. 
Hence, the logical next step in our growth is to take those points into the future and 
unleash their full potential. And we’ll do it through our blockchain-powered platform 
for an omnichannel loyalty economy. 

MARKET OPPORTUNITY 
Appsolutely is in a unique position to spearhead the omnichannel loyalty economy. 
Our loyalty system is the only one in Southeast Asia that is fully integrated with major 
point-of-sale providers. This market position will be difficult to replicate, as this level 
of integration went through a long and complicated process.  

In addition, our company’s mobile loyalty apps allow clients to acquire consumer 
information and launch marketing campaigns while saving millions in market survey, 
card production, printing, publication, and direct advertising costs, making us an ideal 
choice for loyalty programs. Using these advantages, we plan to expand aggressively 
as more clients in food, pharmacy, remittance, petroleum, fashion, and specialty retail 
businesses benefit from the competitive advantages of having our solutions.  

We also note that there’s a lot of room for growth in digital loyalty and e-commerce, 
our two areas of expertise, aside from the possibilities opened by blockchain. Based 

�6



on a survey conducted by auditing firm KPMG , although 42% of companies in the 3

Philippines report that their customers prefer to shop online, about 73% of them have 
not been able to innovate their business model accordingly. They indicated that they 
would increase their investments in better data analytics and technologies. With 
similar conditions in developing and even developing countries, we are here to fill that 
void.

CLIENTS 
Appsolutely’s current clientele includes some of the largest corporations in the 
Philippines, as well as franchises of international brands. Through these brands, we 
serve about 2 million customers who are part of loyalty programs we developed. 
These corporations are market leaders in diverse, customer-facing industries such as 
fuels (Petron), clothing (Bench), and convenience stores (FamilyMart). In addition, we 
have launched customer loyalty programs for international brands’ branches in the 
country, most of which are in the restaurant and fashion businesses.

LOYALPLATFORM 
THE FUTURE OF THE LOYALTY ECONOMY 

CURRENT LOYALTY ENVIRONMENT 
More companies and customers around the world are embracing the advantages of 
customer loyalty programs. In the US, for instance, loyalty program enrollment 
increased from 2.65 billion in 2012 to 3.32 billion in 2015 , according to Big 4 4

accounting firm Deloitte. The average American belongs to more than ten loyalty 
programs. Meanwhile, retail loyalty programs are a hit in Asia, where seven in ten 
customers with Internet access are part of one or more loyalty programs, global 
survey company Nielsen noted . 5

Despite the growth in loyalty program participation, numerous pain points have 
prevented these programs from realizing their full potential. Deloitte noted that as of 
2016, only half of loyalty program participants are active, and one-fifth of those active 
participants never redeemed their rewards. Noted problems include low redemption 
rates, high operational costs, account inactivity and other logistical concerns as 
hindrances to improving customer loyalty. 

Loyalty programs need to address these inconveniences and cater to consumer 
preference. Nielsen noted that the most valued rewards in loyalty programs are 
monetary in nature, so these programs have to emphasize their more redemptive 
features moving forward. Global loyalty program participants also value flexibility in 
earning rewards, regardless of channel and choice of rewards to retrieve. 

In summary, the current loyalty economy has coordination problems with unrealized 
rewards, and customers are desiring more flexibility and monetary benefits. In The 
Loyalty Economy of the future, customers need to get what they want, and pain 
points must be removed.

OUR SOLUTION: LOYALPLATFORM 
LoyalPlatform is the overall ecosystem that Appsolutely will build to spearhead the 
next generation of customer loyalty, or The Loyalty Economy. This ecosystem, which 
will include a new virtual currency, a digital wallet, a series of white label apps, 
and a coalition of supporting merchants, is set to change the current uninspired and 
value-deficient rewards points system to a value-focused, digital-based rewards 
system that will stand head and shoulders above traditional rewards programs. 

Through the LoyalPlatform, customers are more engaged with companies’ loyalty 
programs, while acquiring better rewards for their consumption. Meanwhile, in this 
new world order of more valuable, tradable rewards tokens, companies that run 
customer loyalty programs can extract more value from the rewards they give out. A 
new frontier of competition is created, with companies raising the bar in customer 
service and loyalty programs. 

 
LOYALCOIN 
The central piece of the omnichannel customer loyalty 
platform that we’re building is the LoyalCoin, the 
medium of exchange that now replaces the traditional 
rewards point. The LoyalCoin token will serve as a utility 
token that will be the medium of exchange in the 
rewards ecosystem, where customers earn LoyalCoin 

when spending at participating merchants. LoyalCoin is returned to merchants when 
customers redeem available rewards. 

When customers earn LoyalCoin, they are empowered to use it in more ways than 
traditional customer loyalty programs offer. In both conventional and blockchain-
based rewards systems, customers can acquire rewards and incentives using their 
points. However, in this new ecosystem, the points from one merchant can be used to 
acquire rewards from any merchant within the ecosystem, even if it's a separate 
merchant. In addition to redeeming rewards, LoyalCoin can be exchanged for rewards 
from other merchants, as well as future functions that blockchain technology will 
allow. 

 

�10



LOYALWALLET AND WHITE LABEL APPS 
Much of the economic activity that the LoyalCoin 
generates takes place in the LoyalWallet app, which 
facilitates the purchase of goods and services, 
redemption activities, import and export of tokens, 
and currency conversion. We will also offer merchants 
the option to get customized white label apps that 
enable them to hook into the LoyalPlatform with their 

own look and feel and transact with LoyalCoin in the usual earning and burning 
fashion. 

As tokens live on both the blockchain and internally within the the LoyalPlatform, our 
apps will maintain features that incorporate the best of both worlds. At any given 
time, the LoyalWallet and the white label apps will enable functions such as the 
issuance of loyalty points as LoyalCoin, the redemption of rewards through LoyalCoin, 
and the transmission of tokens to friends and family. 

LOYALCOALITION 
We are also building a coalition of companies and 
merchants that support the omnichannel ideal of 
customer loyalty. These forward-looking enterprises 
will support the issuance of LoyalCoin, replacing their 

conventional points systems. These companies will also enable the use of LoyalCoin 
earned from a coalition participant on other merchants in the coalition.  

This arrangement allows for a wider scope of usage for LoyalCoin, a more rewarding 
customer experience, and an incentive for customers to stay loyal with the brands 
that are part of The Loyalty Economy, the components of which are shown on 
Diagram 1.

TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW 
BLOCKCHAIN-BASED. SCALABLE AND SECURE. 

The following discussion outlines the technology that enables the overall 
LoyalPlatform and our vision of The Loyalty Economy.  

LOYALCOIN TOKEN TECHNOLOGY 
LoyalCoin exists as digital assets, or mosaics, on the NEM blockchain. Coin holders will 
be able to check their LoyalCoin balance and transfer LoyalCoin to other addresses, 
including exchanges. All LoyalCoin is pre-mined with a fixed market capitalization of 9 
billion coins. This number represents the sum of all coins circulating within the 
ecosystem. 

This utility token will be divisible to 6 decimal places. Internal LoyalCoin facilitates 
payment for activities such as reward payouts, redemptions, and more. 

MERCHANT DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT 
Appsolutely currently administers customer rewards programs for several retailers 
and more than 2,000 merchant locations in the Philippines. These retailers integrate 
our traditional points-based rewards program through their point-of-sale systems. 
They use white label apps that we have developed and continue to provide 
development and hosting services for. We expect all of these merchants to upgrade 
from their traditional points system to LoyalCoin. We intend to perform this upgrade 
and to provide ongoing support and administration for these brands.  

Appsolutely will provide full-service support to merchants and their retail locations by 
offering ongoing software development, hosting, training, and consulting on how to 
effectively use our technology within their retail locations. It is not required to be a 
customer of Appsolutely in order to offer the LoyalCoin as a reward. Appsolutely will 
create a RESTful API to allow merchants that are not our customers to also participate 
in the LoyalCoalition. 

Here’s an illustration that shows how the participants in the LoyalCoin usage process 
are connected with each other. 

�13



Diagram 2 

RESTfulAPI 
It is not necessary to be a customer of Appsolutely to offer LoyalCoin as a reward. 
Merchants that are not customers will have access to a public API that will enable 
them to participate in the LoyalCoalition and receive payments using the LoyalWallet. 
These companies can maintain their own apps and integrate with our system through 
the API to receive payments and provide redemption. Their customers can use the 
LoyalWallet to make payments for their goods or services, they can also build their 
own custom solutions to transact cash or LoyalCoin. 

�14



PAYMENTS WALKTHROUGH 
There will be a one-scan process for payments at participating retailers. A QR code will 
be printed on paper or displayed on a tablet device. Customers need only to open 
their LoyalWallet app and scan the QR code to pay the bill. They may pay in LoyalCoin 
or other currencies, both fiat and virtual, depending on a user’s preference and other 
prevailing factors.  

Diagram 3 

Rewards redemption occurs when a merchant takes payment in LoyalCoin. All 
participating merchants will be required to accept LoyalCoin payment for some or all 
of their products or services. All of the payments and rewards earned or spent are 
recorded in our database.  

Administering our own payments enables us to track LoyalCoin movement between 
customers and merchants and to display a user’s LoyalCoin balance within the white 

�15



label or LoyalWallet app. LoyalCoin within either of these apps can also be sent to a 
user’s XEM-compatible digital wallet. Appsolutely will add this functionality into 
participating white label apps and the LoyalWallet. 

ON-CHAIN AND OFF-CHAIN DESIGN 
The NEM network is characterized by fast transaction times and low fees. 
Nevertheless we propose a hybrid internal/external storage model to mitigate the 
transaction costs incurred by the large number of small transactions involved in a 
retail rewards system. 

Transactions internal to the LoyalCoin system such as token rewards and redemption, 
balance checks and so on can be transacted in real time on a private, permissioned 
database. Customer accounts are reconciled offline with the NEM public network to 
enable withdrawals and transfers with the outside world. The technical details of this 
system are the subject of a separate technical white paper.  

Balances that remain in the LoyalCoin system become available to power the vibrant 
LoyalCoin marketplace of e-payments, points conversion, and rewards redemption. All 
transactions on the LoyalPlatform, including those that involve the credit and debit of 
LoyalCoin balances, take place instantly as the LoyalCoin coalition apps runs on our 
private network. 

The instant settlement of earnings and total LoyalCoin balance provide a satisfying 
user-experience and encouragement for users to continue with loyalty shopping and 
rewards redemption, whilst seeing their LoyalCoin balance updated in real-time. 
Depending on their situation, some users will prefer to maintain their LoyalCoin 
internally and others on the NEM blockchain. 

�16



LOYALCOIN (LYL) 
LOYALTY YOU’LL LOVE 

The LoyalCoin (LYL) token is the utility token that will be used on the omnichannel 
loyalty platform we are building. LYL will serve as both denomination for the rewards 
ecosystem and avenue for exchange into other virtual and fiat currencies. 

When customers earn LYL from their rewards programs, they are empowered to use 
the tokens on more options than the traditional customer loyalty program can offer. 
As with the usual program, customers can retrieve rewards and incentives using their 
points. But in this ecosystem we’re building, the points from one merchant can be 
used to redeem rewards from any merchant a customer prefers. 

HOW LYL ADDS VALUE 
LYL Is attached to a customer rewards ecosystem that makes a case for significant 
usage by the general public. Even at the current state, where Appsolutely has many 
merchant partners and serves more than 2 million users through the loyalty programs 
we operate, there is a good chance of mass adoption for the token. We’re also putting 
economic value into loyalty points that otherwise would have gone stagnant and 
expired. The value unlocked by these previously unused points will be a source of 
surplus economic activity, which results in more transactions. 

In addition, the LoyalPlatform will drive revenues for Appsolutely in two ways. We 
earn revenues from per-transaction fees involving the use of LYL as payment and its 
exchange into other rewards points. Appsolutely will also earn from subscription fees 
connected with the LoyalCoalition, the white label apps we create, and the use of APIs 
connected to the platform. 

 
The revenues that we earn from the LoyalPlatform will be further used on the 
scalability and widespread adoption of LYL, as well as arrangements that sustain the 
platform and its attractiveness to both companies and consumers.  

�17



TOKEN GENERATING EVENT 
COME GET SOME LYL 

There will be 5 billion tokens to be offered in the token generating event (TGE), 95% 
which will be distributed before and during the TGE. The remaining 5% of the TGE-
linked tokens will be used for our promotional activities to market the TGE. 

This arrangement enables the general public to acquire up to 55.56% of the total 
tokens during the crowdfunding stage. The remaining 44.44% goes into an operations 
pool administered by Appsolutely in order to provide merchants with the necessary 
amount of tokens to be able to payout rewards to their customers. Appsolutely may 
give or sell these tokens to merchants depending on the situation. These tokens will 
ultimately end up in the hands of customers once they make purchases at 
participating merchants. Once the token is acquired by the customer, they may hold 
it, trade it or redeem it. In the case of redemption, the coin is returned to merchant, 
who can then use it to redistribute to their customers. 

The tokens can be used functionally with the LoyalWallet, as soon as we launch the 
platform in early 2018. Given that a pilot test for the platform will be completed 
before the TGE even launches, the platform’s launch is imminent. Prior to that, digital 
asset holders will get XEM tokens, or the digital token of the NEM blockchain, 
distributed to them through digital wallets compatible with XEM. We’ve provided a 
summary of details below.
