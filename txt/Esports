1. ESPORTS

Definition of ‘eSports’ by the Oxford Dictionary – 
“A multiplayer video game played competitively for
spectators, typically by professional gamers.”

1.1 WHAT DOES ESPORTS TRULY MEAN? 
The simplified definition is “competitive gaming at a professional level”. It is based upon 
video games, however not on specific games, rather on any game that has a purpose 
and people play against one another. In general, it works just like traditional sports - the 
more popular a sport is, the more people are interested and practice it, and the better the 
competition is.

The objectives differ in the games but the majority of games are team-based and the 
players compete in tournaments, leagues, and offline events. Just like in traditional 
sports there are finals, qualifications, championships and so on. An important remark is 
that the leagues are usually region-specific – for instance Europe only or North America 
only. However the biggest events are open internationally and all teams are able to 
qualify for them, just like in the football world cup for instances.

1.2 WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR TITLES? 
At the time of writing this paper there are over 50 eSports titles – ranging by genre and 
publishers into multiple categories, the two most notable ones are:

Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games – MOBAs
This genre incorporates allowing the player to control a single character in a team which 
competes versus another team of players. The objective is to destroy the opposing 
team’s main structure.



5

Some of the biggest games in this category are League of Legends by Riot Games,  
Dota 2 by Valve Corporation and Heroes of the Storm by Blizzard Activision.
  
First-person shooters – FPS

This is a type of video game the gameplay of which involves shooting enemies and 
other targets and in which a player views the action as though through the eyes of the 
character they are controlling.

Some of the biggest games in this category are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive by Valve 
Corporation, Overwatch by Blizzard Activision and PlayerUnknown’s 

Battlegrounds by Bluehole Studio Inc.

Other notable mentions – Hearthstone by Blizzard Activision, a collectible card game, 
StarCraft II by Blizzard Activision, a real-time strategy game, Fifa and other sports games 
by Electronic Arts.

1.3 HOW BIG ARE ESPORTS? 
One of the most competitive traits of eSports is their extreme accessibility.  
Practically anyone can play the games and has a chance of becoming a pro.  
This, in addition to the sheer entertainment value of the games, means а massive global 
viewership. Millions are watching the tournaments and even more hours are spent 
casually following streamers in the meantime. The numbers, of course, are growing 
constantly.



6

1.4 WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE ESPORTS?
Forecasts that seemed too optimistic at some point, now look like they’re seriously 
underestimating the entertainment capacity of eSports. Even with high market 
projections, eSports are continuing to exceed expectations. We’ve seen the enormous 
potential of the industry in just a few years. Now we’re lucky enough to be able to  
witness it reach its full power in the coming decades and we’re determined to be  
a major part of it.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1 ESPORTS LANDSCAPE
The eSports landscape incorporates a few different entities – publishers, events & their 
organisers, teams, and fanbase. Those cannot be weighted in importance and are not 
listed in such a manner.

Publishers

There are many publishers of games that are considered eSports or are attempting to 
become one. The most notable ones are:

• Blizzard Activision – Headquartered in Santa Monica, California and founded 
in 2008 through the merger of Vivendi Games and Activision.  The eSports 
titles that they publish are Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft II and 
Hearthstone. They also have a rich portfolio of other games such as World of 
Warcraft, Diablo, and others. They also acquired MLG (Major League Gaming) in 
an attempt to be more active on the eSports front. 

• Riot Games - Their main office is based in West Los Angeles, California 
established in 2006. They publish League of Legends, among the game 
development they are also involved in Tournament organising and championship 
support for their title. 

• Valve Corporation - Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, Valve Corporation 
was established in 1996. Most notably Valve publishes the Steam platform – 
that is the biggest video game store on PC. They also publish Counter Strike: 
Global Offensive and Dota 2.

2.2 ESPORTS ECOSYSTEM

2.3 MARKET OPPORTUNITY
The eSports scene is very diverse – there are many games, many publishers and 
hundreds of websites that cover different aspects of it.

Imagine for a moment that you needed to check football news in multiple small local 
websites – if you needed to find out something about a Brazilian team – you would have 
to go to a Brazilian webpage; if you needed to see a score from a match in Wales, you 
would need to go to a Welsh page. No BBC, no Sky Sports, no Livescores.com, no unified 
place.  To further elaborate on the problem, now imagine that football had 20 different 
rulesets in place, and each ruleset had its own federations and websites – not very 
convenient, right?

This is how the eSports industry operates – there are many publishers, with even more 
games and millions of players that visit small hub websites to find news about their 
favourite games. There isn’t a consolidating space, where users can go and see all 
eSports-related news, scores and a calendar of upcoming events. Nowadays eSports are 
similar to football in the 1950s.

2.4 TECHNOLOGY
We will use the most advanced blockchain-based technology to deliver a fully transparent 
environment for the eSports space. We are currently working on this solution and it will 
be developed over the next months.

In addition, our goal is to create a fully automated platform which will dramatically 
increase ease and transparency of financial operations in the content creation process.

In the long run, most or all of the content on our platform will be open-sourced.  
Content creators will be ranked and paid based on their posts’ view count and organic 
user engagement.



11

3. VISION
Everything we do, we believe in unification and convenience. We value time, and it is 
important for us to give our visitors the opportunity to preserve on it, and make their life 
easier. The way we do it is by creating a platform that will incorporate a beautiful, simple 
to use design, that is also user-friendly.

The name of this platform is eSports.com, and if something is related to eSports, you can 
be confident that it will be covered on it.

We believe in things that work and do exactly what they are stating they do. An airplane 
brings people from point A to point B, a violin creates pleasant sound, a light bulb gives 
light. 

Our vision is to create the unified place for every aspect of eSports.  
A journey within eSports that starts and ends within eSports.com



12

A journey starts with a single step, and then it goes through multiple stages – a long 
road with many obstacles. We envision that every visitor on our platform should be able 
to complete their journey without leaving eSports.com – whether they are an eSports 
enthusiast or a complete novice to the scene, they should be able to find everything 
they’re looking for at a glance.

eSports constitute one of the very few global spaces which are almost 100% digital  
and accessible. This new space is fully developed and functional, and at the same  
time - swelling with potential. 

The mission of eSports.com will be to ensure that the most technologically advanced 
sport on the planet has the best platform to live and grow on, that’s equally advanced. 
Blockchain technology is a true game changer which will continue to disrupt and 
substitute classic models one environment at a time. 

We believe a platform such as the one we aim to create absolutely needs to be well-
organised, intuitive, secure and transparent. In many regards, such as track records, 
association possibilities, and the digital application of democratic principles, blockchain 
technology will help us achieve a balance between control and accessibility, giving our 
users the freedom to contribute within the fair limits of our vision and strategy.

4. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT

December - 2016 Conception - 
Our vision was to create a portal with 
everything the eSports world could 
want in one place. Entertainment, 
statistics and education.

February 2017
Creation of eSports reward token (ERT), 

our own in-house currency, to be used 
across all features of the portal.

July 2017
Decision to take eSports.com to ICO.

December 2017
Completed successful ICO - over 

5 million Euro raised.

May 2017  
Acquisition of eSports.com URL.  
The domain is logical and instantly 
recognisable.

October 2017
Raised our target of 2.5 million Euro  
pre ICO investment. 



14

5. ESPORTS.COM
Domain names are some of the most valuable digital assets companies have. According 
to Brandirectory the three most valuable brands in the world are Amazon (151M USD), 
Apple (146M USD) and Google (120M USD). These brands are so valuable because the 
companies have become one of the most prominent players in their industries. Amazon 
as the global well-known only shop, Apple as the synonym of the technical excellence 
with their electronic devices and Google that operates as a technological conglomerate 
specializing in internet-related services and products.

January 2018
Established partnership with  
Overwolf & ESL

January 2018
Begun production of eSports.com 
portal - eSports.com portal launch - 
featuring first stage content and video.

January 2018
ERT listed on c-cex.com, 

coinexchange.io, wordcoinindex.com

https://www.esports.com/



15

eSports as a new blooming industry also deserves a domain that will represent its  
bright future, therefore our domain as our most valuable asset cannot be called anything 
other than esports.com. Think twice, which domain with the eSports theme can attract 
more audience than eSports.com. The extra net income stream generated from the 
competitive advantage of this domain possession is the generator of its intellectual 
property value that has been already valued for 7 figures. We underline our vision to be 
the leading authority in the eSports industry. The added value also relates to SEO, virility, 
and partnerships in the media or the eSports industry itself. The URL is logical and 
instantly recognizable. 

The value of this domain will gradually increase with time, because people will be able 
to automatically land on it, through search engines. The traffic related to eSports has 
massively increased in the past few years, doubling on an annual base. This on itself will 
be enough to drive people to the page. 

6. TECH DESCRIPTION OF ERT
Esports Reward Token (“ERT”) is an Ethereum-based reward token using Ethereum token 
standard (ERC20) for Ethereum smart contracts. Smart contracts are revolutionary 
feature of blockchain, automated autonomous program that encapsulated code enabling 
the execution of the set functionality according to the business logic anticipated. As Nick 
Szabo theorized: “A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes 
the terms of a contract.” These contracts work on the principle that the programmed 
code becomes a law, so there is no arbitrator or third party in the execution process. 



16

Most tokens created through ICOs on Ethereum are ERC20 compliant. For tokens in the 
Ethereum network, ERC 20 is a standard interface. ERC stands for Ethereum Request 
for Comments supporting six functionalities and two events. The primary benefit of 
an ERC20 token is interoperability with other compliant tokens and decentralized 
applications on Ethereum. In practice it allows the smart contracts to act similarly like 
Bitcoin or Ethereum. ERC20 tokens can also be traded on all platforms that support 
Ethereum standards.

Ethereum thus becomes the main technological platform that enabled the ICO of our 
token taking advantage of the security the Ethereum protocol provides. ERT is a digital 
currency operating on a blockchain technology in which encryption is used for the 
verification of the funds transfers as well as for the generation of the new currency units. 
Total supply of the ERT is 60 million. 

To hold tokens the only requirement is to have an Ethereum wallet. Any ERC20 is 
piggybacked on the Ethereum protocol, thus the Ethereum will provide the basic 
functionality to assign and transfer tokens.

8crypt is a software platform based upon own blockchain technology that connects to 
other technologies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, and others. 



17

Offering high security and data protection when cryptocurrencies are traded and 
connecting cryptos to fiat currency accepting rapid transfer payments incl. SEPA claims 
to be a promising base for 8crypt to become the platform for ERT to be traded on.

More than that the direct integration of the 8crypt wallet into the eSports website is just 
on its way. In case a user has his ERT tokens within an 8crypt wallet, the token balance is 
already visible on the eSports website. Purchases on the eSports Website will be settled 
with one click. And finally, it is planned to buy and sell tokens through 8crypt again 
directly from the eSports website (which avoids the alternative way of using exchanges). 
The future of 8crypt is in addition of the wallet functionalities to enable the usage of ERT 
in the Venture capital fund structure as a trading platform.

Any eSports registered user may register his 8crypt wallet free of charge. The depth of 
8crypt integration into the eSports website is always related to the user’s decision – so 
the security is only in the user’s sole hands.

This really simple implementation and direct connection of the two services (eSports and 
8crypt) should eliminate any hurdles and the ERT token can be used directly by any user.



18

7. USE CASES OF ERT
ERT stands for eSports Reward Token and is the main currency on our community 
platform. It is an ERC20 Token released on the ETH main net. (This is a digitalised 
industry – it makes the most sense having a token here – really digital, really global, no 
other place where it makes that much sense) – punchline.

The eSports are fully digital, it is one of those industries in the world, where every 
interaction happens digitally, it is truly digital and truly global. It makes the most sense 
to have a token in this industry because it will come naturally to the people to use it – a 
more convenient way of trading and interacting.

Some notable examples of what can ERT be used for?

Means of payment
Every T-Shirt you buy, every 
coaching lesson you book is 
done through ERT.

Reward system
When others value your 
content, we’ll reward you for 
your contribution with ERT.

Exclusive offers
Access special features, 
merchandise and content, only 
available through ERT.

Game currency
We are currently working on 
integrating ERT as a payment 
method on partner websites 
and in games.

ERT generating hardware
We are going to introduce 
gaming machines that you can 
use to both mine ERT & play 
games simultaneously.

ERT investment opportunities
You’ll be able to invest ERT in 
eSports.com approved ICO 
projects.

USES OF FUNDS - DEVELOPMENT PHASE 



23

Strong community will enhance the popularity of the eSports and support ambitions to 
acknowledge the eSports as a discipline by International Olympic Committee. 

eSports industry grows and will culminate close to 1.5B USD by 2020, so further  
M&A activity in this sector is expected. According to CrunchBase, non-controlling equity 
investments in the eSports have already reached YTD 2017 1.2B USD. The Deal Flow 
CAGR 2013-2017 is astonishing 59% and this trend continues. The shift from the early 
stage to later stage investing opens a space for venture capital investments in the 
upcoming years when the startup boom consolidates. Gaming is one of the fastest 
growing tech industries with a global fan base. Conglomerates such as Amazon  
(Twitch acquisition 2014) or Alibaba (International eSports Federation 2016) already 
invest in eSports heavily.

Our strategy is to develop partnerships in form of JV or realize strategic acquisitions, 
where we can benefit from the operational and financial synergy. Expansion through 
strategic investments is the key to success in the competition with other eSports 
projects. 



24

11. GOVERNANCE
Our ambitions go way beyond the local scale. eSports.com will not remain a  
single-purpose portal but will expand internationally, growing both organically and in 
accordance with an elaborate expansion strategy. Therefore, the goal is to create a 
company which is not only well established in the ICO field but also applies all the rules 
of international financial markets.

We strongly support all ICO-positive movements and transparency in this sector.  
The blockchain-supported ICO governance is one example of the good practices eSports.
com will apply to its business model in that context.

However, since this business sector is relatively new and it is bound to undergo many 
changes in the near future, we will regularly adjust our governance strategy.  
This flexibility will allow us to not only fulfill all lawful requirements but find new ways  
to stand out way above the sector in terms of intendance.

It is worth mentioning that security is among the crucial and omnipresent concerns on 
our agenda and we constantly thrive to improve in this regard, following the latest and 
best practices. So, to ensure safe authentication and guarantee the privacy and integrity 
of exchanged data through our website, we have implemented the strongest HTTPS 
networking protocols.

We will work towards maintaining the positive image of the ICO sector. We will actively 
support all of its current and future members in their efforts to help create and apply 
regulation to a positive outcome for everyone involved.

eSports.com will be regularly audited and all the numbers will be announced to investors 
on a quarterly basis, according to the company’s strategy.
