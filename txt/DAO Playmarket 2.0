1. INTRODUCTION 

The Android app market is a huge industry that is expanding from day 
to day. Access to this market is mainly provided through mobile app 
stores, which are dominated by Google Play. The exception is China, 
where alternative platforms (MyApp, 360 Mobile Assistant, Baidu Mobile 
Assistant, etc.) are popular.

All stores have a centralized architecture and practically none of them 
accepts cryptocurrency as a means of payment. 

DAO PlayMarket 2.0 is a decentralized Android app store that accepts 
cryptocurrency payments. It is combined with a crowdinvesting (ICO) 
developer platform.

The key idea of DAO PlayMarket 2.0 is to create a decentralized self-
sufficient community where users can make their own decisions without 
involving traditional centralized structures. 

The goals and objectives of PlayMarket 2.0 are to create a sustainable 
economic model for developers, investors and users by way of voting, and 
to develop a single tokenization standard for the mobile app market.

The decentralized storage architecture will provide a smooth and 
censorship-resistant access to apps, while the smart contract system will 
ensure secure purchases. 

The crowdinvesting (ICO) platform will enable developers to raise 
additional financing for developing their projects.

Thanks to a built-in cryptocurrency exchange, you will be able to purchase 
app’s tokens with any currency.

To date, there are about a thousand cryptocurrencies, while the number 
of mobile apps has already exceeded one million. Our project team is 
launching a tokenization process for the mobile app market. This will lead 
to a rapid increase in the number of tokens all over the world and open a 
new huge market for cryptocurrencies.



2. MARKET ANALYSIS
2.1. EXISTING PLATFORMS AND STORES 

The analysis performed by the DAO PlayMarket 
2.0 team, as well as information from publicly 
available studies confirm that the mobile 
app market is a promising and fast-growing 
industry.

In 2016, its turnover reached about USD 62 
billion. It is expected to grow to USD 82 billion 
in 2017 and to USD 139 billion by 2021. The 
number of downloads of mobile apps grew by 
15% compared to 2015. At the same time, app 
usage time increased by 25%.

The existing platforms and the Google Play 
store control almost the entire global market 
of mobile applications, which has resulted 
in lack of competition and, therefore, high 
commission costs. The monopolization of the 

market imposes serious limitations on the 
majority of mobile app developers, as well as 
increases the risks of blocking apps for all 
users. 

As of May 2017, there are only about 40 
different alternative mobile app stores in the 
world that can be divided into the following 
categories: 

• global app stores;

• stores of large corporations;

• local stores that are popular 
in one country or region;

• cross-platform app store; 

• Chinese mobile app stores.



2.2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES 
OF DAO PLAYMARKET 2.0
 
The DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform has a lot 
of advantages over alternative platforms and 
large mobile app stores, such as:

• the platform is resistant to censorship: 
the basic information is stored 
in a blockchain, which ensures 
security and provides access to apps 
from anywhere in the world;

• developers are given the opportunity 
to raise additional investments for 
their projects through a built-in 
crowdinvesting (ICO) platform. 
Any developer can issue tokens 
of their app in a few clicks;

• the DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
has an integrated decentralized 
cryptocurrency exchange, for which 
an open programming interface (API) 
will be developed. The API will be 
available to third-party developers for 
integration into various systems; 

• the platform accepts payments with 
cryptocurrencies to significantly expand 
a range of uses of the store and to make 
cryptocurrency closer to end users;

• developers can promote their apps 
by setting the conditions for users to 
receive tokens for installing an app;

• at the first stage, all apps are scanned 
for viruses and exploits in automatic 
mode, and then manual moderation is 
performed. Later, with the development 
of the platform, moderation algorithms 
will be determined by the community 
(DAO) using the latest technologies.

Thanks to these advantages, the platform 
becomes more functional as compared to its 
predecessors.

3. CURRENCY OF 
THE PLATFORM
 
Ethereum is used as the base digital currency 
of the platform. However, prices of apps and/
or other products can be set in both Ethereum 
and a fiat currency (USD). After setting, the 
price is converted to the base currency at the 
current exchange rate. 

4. ISSUE AND 
DISTRIBUTION 
OF TOKENS
 
Tiсker for DAO PlayMarket 2.0 tokens: PMT. 

PMT standard: ERC20.

Number of PMT tokens: 3,000,000

It is planned to distribute 75% of tokens 
through ICO and invest the raised funds in 
the marketing program to promote the DAO 
PlayMarket 2.0 platform.

At each ICO stage, a discount is granted 
depending on the stage and the total amount 
of purchase. 450 thousand pieces will be 
distributed at each stage. The maximum 
duration of each stage is 10 days. If 450 
thousand tokens are sold in less than 10 days, 
there will be an automatic transition to the 
next stage.

Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, DASH) 
are accepted for payment of DAO PlayMarket 
2.0 tokens.

All raised funds are guaranteed to be deposited 
into the account and will be stored on wallets 
with multi-signatures.

The remaining 25% of PMT tokens will be 
transferred to the project team that acts as the 
organizer of DAO PlayMarket 2.0 and will be 
frozen for 24 months.



5. DISTRIBUTION 
OF FUNDS
 
All raised funds will be invested in the 
implementation of the marketing program.

The marketing strategy is divided into three 
parts depending on the main target audiences:

• users;

• developers of android apps;

• investors.

Users are the most important target audience 
because the growing number of users will 
attract more developers and investors.

5.1. ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
FOR ATTRACTING USERS

The main goal of this campaign is to increase 
loyalty and gain the trust of users. To achieve 
this goal, we will launch native advertising 
on thematic Internet resources of different 
languages with MAUs over 120 thousand 
and involve celebrities in our project. This 
advertising approach will be used throughout 
the entire marketing campaign. After the 
launch of the DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform, 
banner advertising in the Google Advertising 
Network, teaser advertising and advertising 
in social networks (Facebook, Instagram 
and Twitter) will be posted to increase the 
audience coverage.

In the future, users will be attracted through 
CPL and CPS models, which imply the 
development of a referral reward program.

After receiving information about our 
audience, we will analyze it and launch a 
remarketing campaign.

5.2. ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FOR 
ATTRACTING DEVELOPERS

The developer audience is divided into two 
main segments:

freelancers and teams.

For both segments, contextual advertising will 
be used with a clear separation of the target 
audience. 

We are also interested in holding hackathons 
for developers in the leading countries in this 
industry. At present, we cooperate with 185 
development teams and have contact details 
of over a million private developers. Thanks 
to this, immediately after the launch of the 
DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform, more than 500 
unique android apps will be published.



5.3. ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 
FOR INVESTORS

To attract investors, we decided to use the 
PPC advertising model, i.e. collection and 
segmentation of key queries in search engines 
and launch contextual advertising. Moreover, 
as in the case of developers, we plan to launch 
contextual advertising for target audience 
segments on thematic Internet resources.

The marketing strategy is based on the 
currently available data and may be modified 
during the launch of the platform. Monthly 
expense reports will be published and made 
available to investors of the project.

6. INVESTMENT 
ADVANTAGES OF THE 
DAO PLAYMARKET 2.0 
PLATFORM 
 
The DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform implies 
that holders of PMT tokens automatically 
become co-owners of the platform-based 
DAO PlayMarket Foundation (PMF). One of the 
primary functions of the foundation is open 
management of its resources in conjunction 
with other members of DAO PlayMarket 2.0. 

Developers of apps based on the PlayMarket 
2.0 platform can issue tokens of their apps. The 
platform’s commission makes up 5% of these 
tokens, which are automatically contributed 
to PlayMarket Foundation. Thus, the PMF will 
be constantly replenished with tokens placed 

on the app platform and pay dividends to 
members of DAO PlayMarket 2.0.

The revenue from the foundation is distributed 
on a pro rata basis to all holders of PMT tokens.



7. ADVANTAGES 
FOR DEVELOPERS
1. Developers can issue tokens of 

their app and distribute them 
among current shareholders.

2. The DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
allows developers to issue tokens of 
their app and sell them through the 
built-in crowdinvesting (ICO) platform 
to external investors and users.

3. Developers can accept 
cryptocurrency for their apps. 

4. The platform commission is 1% 
(Google Play has about 30%). This 
commission is collected by a node as 
a reward for financial transactions.

5. Developer will receive income from 
sales of their app and its content 
for a strictly fixed period under a 
concluded smart contract. Due to the 
features of the blockchain technology, 
when a user purchases an app, the 
income is instantly distributed 
among the owners of app’s tokens.

6. Source codes of all internal smart 
contracts DAO PlayMarket 2.0, 
the mobile app PlayMarket 2.0 
and website playmarket.io will be 
available. Moreover, all the platform 
documentation will be publicly available.

7. No bureaucracy.

The DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform will also 
provide developers with simple and effective 
tools to promote their apps, including user-
friendly feedback between the developer and 
users.



8. ADVANTAGES FOR 
OWNERS OF NODES 
Owners of nodes receive 1% of income from 
transactions processed through them as 
reward.

The stable operation of the platform depends 
on a certain number of nodes in the network 
that ensure the reception and transfer of 
transactions to the blockchain, exchange of 
apps and information about them.

The more users the platform will have, the 
more nodes will be needed. To add a node 
to the list of trusted nodes, its owner should 
make a guarantee deposit in the base currency 

of the platform and a fixed number of PMT 
tokens under the smart contract.

The deposit is required as a pledge and 
guarantee of reliable node operation. Its 
amount is calculated dynamically, depending 
on the turnover passing through it.

Below are the estimated rewards that owners 
of nodes can be entitled to. The estimation is 
based on 10 to 50 nodes and provided for three 
options depending on the monthly turnover 
in the base currency. As a result, the reward 
per node varies from 0.60 ETH to 1.80 ETH (at 
the rate of 1 ETH = 300 USD, from 180 USD to 
540 USD).

9. ADVANTAGES FOR 
USERS  
In most mobile app stores, the user can only 
download and install an app, rate it on a five-
point scale and leave a comment. In addition 
to this, the DAO Playmarket 2.0 platform will 
allow users:

1. To invest in developing the app they like 
and earn a dividend income from it.

2. To enjoy additional benefits, for 
example, tokens for a purchased app 
or for taking actions within the app.

3. To get secure and smooth access to the 
decentralized, censorship-resistant 
platform, both at the national level and at 
the level of specific mobile app stores.

4. To pay for purchases with cryptocurrency.

Thus, the user gets the opportunity to be not 
just a consumer, but also to participate actively 
in the platform, to promote its development 
and to derive financial benefits from this.



10. TECHNOLOGY
The main technological goal is to provide free, 
smooth and censorship-resistant access to the 
platform, as well as to ensure the confidence 
in income distribution issues.

The platform operation is based on storing 
information about developers and apps in a 
distributed database while preserving the 
principle of data immutability. As such a 
database, we use the Ethereum blockchain 
thanks to its support for smart contracts 
that provide the necessary logic for the DAO 
PlayMarket 2.0 platform.

Architecturally, we are not tied to a particular 
blockchain. Therefore, if a more suitable 
blockchain is created, the platform will be 
moved to it.

10.1. ETHEREUM AND ERC20

The Ethereum blockchain is currently the 
industry standard for the issuance of digital 
assets and smart contracts. The ERC20 token 
interface allows you to deploy a standard 
token that is compatible with the existing 
infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem. It 
includes development tools, wallets, exchanges 
and bureaus de change.

The ability of Ethereum to deploy Turing 
complete smart contracts without an 
intermediary guarantor supports complex 
issuance of cryptocurrencies, digital financial 
contracts, and automated incentive structure.

Ethereum with its advanced capabilities and 
an active ecosystem is ideal for PMT.

10.2. ARCHITECTURE

The main task is to ensure stable and smooth 
operation of all platform components. For this 
purpose, the following features are needed: 

• decentralized data storage’

• acceptance of cryptocurrency payments;

• transparent cash flows;

• open and clear rules for 
motivating all participants.

10.3. PLATFORM MODULES

The platform consists of the following 
modules:

• a data storage system;

• a crowdinvesting (ICO) platform;

• a cryptocurrency exchange;

• a mobile app;

• smart contracts;

• node (backend server);

• a website.



10.4. PLATFORM WORKFLOW 

PlayMarket 2.0 is a software and hardware 
platform that operates as follows.

Apps on the DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform are 
stored in the virtual storage, PlayMarket File 
System (PMFS), implemented using modern 
technologies such as common cloud services, 
distributed hash tables and decentralized file 
storages (IPFS, SIA, ZeroNet, etc).

The user chooses an app through a mobile app 
or website and makes a download request. 

This request is processed by a trusted platform 
node. User ID and details of the app are 
written to the blockchain. In parallel, the 
node checks the user’s balance (in case of 
paid apps) and receives boot files of the app 
from the virtual data storage. If the necessary 
conditions are met, the node transfers the boot 
files to the user. After the price is debited from 
the user’s account, the node completes the 
transaction. Finally, the system determines 
rewards of all participants according to the 
smart contract and writes all details of the 
transaction to the blockchain. 



10.5. PLAYMARKET 2.0 MOBILE APP

The mobile app is developed on the basis of 
the modern technologies recommended by 
Android Developers (the so-called native 
technologies).

The app is equipped with a cold wallet 
created directly on the mobile device. The app 
supports encrypted backup and restore of 
wallets, secure key storage and offline signing 
of transactions. This means that your keys are 
kept on the device and never sent anywhere to 
make a purchase.

The app supports the Markdown markup 
language which provides simple and standard 
formatting of app descriptions, thereby 
allowing developers to create beautiful designs 
for placing apps on the platform.

The mobile app has a mechanism for detecting 
the nearest trusted connection node. Now 
the app uses DNS, but in the future it will be 
connected directly to the blockchain to find 
the nearest node.

All communications between the app and the 
node are encrypted using the TLS protocol.

After installation, the app suggests generating 
a new wallet or importing an existing one. A 
wallet can be replenished directly or through a 
cryptocurrency exchange.

The mobile app connects to the nearest 
node and receives from it all the necessary 
information about apps, their price, etc., as 
well as displays all the data on the screen.

When you purchase an app, PlayMarket 2.0 
generates a transaction, which is transferred 
to the node. The task of the node is to check 
the transaction, the balance and, if all 
conditions are met, to issue the purchased app 
by sending a transaction to the blockchain. 
After the mobile app is downloaded, smart 
contracts indicate the purchase data: name 
of the app and the node through which the 
transaction has been made. This is necessary 
for the subsequent distribution of profits.



10.6. ARCHITECTURE OF THE NODE  
IN THE PLATFORM 

Each node is a system consisting of one or 
more servers with a load balancer (nginx, 
haproxy).

The node provides an API (application 
programming interface) for running mobile 
apps and/or platform sites.

Each node has a full node of Ethereum 
blockchain. When the node is running, the 
information from smart contracts is constantly 
synchronized with a NoSQL DBMS (MongoDB).

This is necessary to speed up the performance 
of the node whose API is implemented on Node.
js. Node.js allows you to create cross-platform, 
high-end services.

The task of the node at the initial stage is to get 
information about frequently used apps from 
the file storage and cache them.

Upon request, it transfers them to the mobile 
app, loads and caches information about new 
applications.

In the future, the mobile app will work 
independently with the blockchain and file 
storage, and the nodes will be responsible 
for receiving and transferring financial 
transactions.



10.7. VIRTUAL FILE STORAGE
 
In view of the technological limitations of the 
blockchain, apps themselves cannot be stored 
on it. In this regard, there is a need for a data 
storage service.

The existing data storage systems, such as 
Amazon Cloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, 
etc., despite their distributed architecture, are 
centralized and do not completely fit the logic 
of the platform. This architecture carries risks 
and a high cost of storage.

With the development of the blockchain 
technology, decentralized data storage 
systems began to develop actively, with no 
single center and no single point of failure (for 
example, such projects as STORJ, SIA, IPFS, 
Ethereum Swarm).

Most projects are founded on similar 
principles, using DHT technology and content 
addressing, when a file’s hash is its identifier.

The distributed hash table is a protocol that 
allows BitTorrent clients to find each other 
without using a tracker.

DHT actually performs the main function of 
the tracker: it helps file sharers to learn about 
each other.

It can:

• help file sharers find each other faster;

• reduce the load on the tracker;

• support file sharers when the 
tracker is not available;

• distribute content without a tracker.

Based on DHT structures, a variety of more 
complex systems are built, such as P2P file 
sharing, cooperative web caching, DNS 
services, and so on.

Pros:

• storage of files in the cloud and 
accessibility regardless of their owner;

• high throughput;

• reliable storage and retrieval of 
files due to financial motivation;

• possibility to delete unprofitable files.

Cons:

• storage of files, rather than 
structured information;

• static files.

Distributed storages seem to be attractive 
for storing files. However, at present such 
storage facilities do not have all of the above 
advantages. For example, in the absence of 
the owner, files are no longer available, which 
prevents the use of this technology in real 
projects.



10.8. SELECTION OF ARCHITECTURE FOR 
VIRTUAL FILE STORAGE 
 
Apps based on the DAO PlayMarket 2.0 
platform will be stored in the virtual 
PlayMarket File System (PMFS).

Under PMFS, we mean the implementation of a 
software interface for accessing various types 
of data storages: traditional (cloud storage, 
CDN, etc.) and distributed data storage 
services (IPFS, ZeroNet).

For decentralized data storage, the following 
options are possible: the use of one or more 
existing solutions; developing your own 
solution.

A content delivery network (CDN) is a set 
of servers with specialized software that 
accelerate the delivery (distribution) of content 
to the end user. Servers are located around the 
world in such a way that the response time to 
visitors is minimal. It is these opportunities 
that allow us to use this network when 
implementing the PlayMarket 2.0 platform.

IPFS is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed file 
system that seeks to connect all computing 
devices with the same file system. The 
main advantage of IPFS is the decentralized 
distribution of content. 

This solution allows you to access content 
in case of irregular access to the Internet 
and even take it from the offline hash. The 
identifier in this decentralized network is 
wrapped in sha128 multihash from the block.

The multihash consists of three parts: 

• ID hash function ;, 

• hash size in bytes ;

• hash.

ZeroNet is an open-source software and, at 
the same time, a peer-to-peer network that 
does not need servers. It uses the BitTorrent 
technology to share web pages and Bitcoin 
cryptography to sign data for sending. 
ZeroNet is seen as a censorship-resistant way 
of delivering information without a single 
point of failure.

The network is popular among users from 
China because it can be used to bypass web 
content filters.



10.9. DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO 
EXCHANGE (PEER-TO-PEER EXCHANGE) 

In order to make the platform fully functional, 
it is necessary to ensure fast conversion 
between currencies / tokens.

This issue is addressed by the integrated 
Playmarket 2.0Exchange (PEX).

Counter orders for purchase and sale form 
a balance of supply and demand from which 
the real market price is derived. This price is 
used to convert a crypto asset into the base 
currency.

The Exchange’s architecture allows for 
high-speed operations, which is ensured 
by management nodes that connect buyers 
with sellers, while performing all operations 
instantly and recording them in the 
blockchain for maximum transparency and 
security.

Moreover, traditional exchanges are able 
to integrate PEX into their systems, while 
retaining some functions of a centralized 
service, such as margin trading, extended 
graphs, acceptance of deposits in fiat 
currencies, etc. and increasing security due to 
P2P infrastructure.

Users can engage in P2P trading in real time 
using familiar tools and interfaces. At the 
same time, they do not risk losing their money 
due to the vulnerabilities that are typical of 
centralized exchanges.

10.10. SMART-CONTRACTS 

The financial logic of the platform is based on 
smart contracts, which solve the problem of 
trust to a third party. Their functions control 
all financial flows, for example, payments 
when shopping through a mobile app. In 
addition, the guarantee deposit of the node 
owner ensures a balance of interests between 
users and app developers.

13. CONCLUSION
 
The DAO PlayMarket 2.0 platform has all chances to capture part of the 
Android app market due to its openness and transparency. The project 
will reduce the dependence of the community on centralized services, 
significantly reduce systemic risks and, therefore, will allow the 
community to develop more effectively.

The access to this platform does not depend on the corporation’s 
permission. Unlike the dominant operating systems of giant companies, 
the DAO PlayMarket 2.0 does not allow the government to impose 
restrictions on their citizens or other countries as related to specific 
apps, or to put pressure on developers. The platform respects human 
rights to privacy (such as the prohibition of data collection and storage, 
the use of privacy data without his/her consent, etc.). All this is made 
possible by the decentralization of the platform.

Our storage architecture facilitates and accelerates the access to apps, 
while the smart contract supports cryptocurrency payments, as well as 
ensures equitable distribution of income between participants.

The PlayMarket 2.0 platform includes a crowdinvesting (ICO) platform, 
which allows mobile app developers to raise additional funds for 
developing their projects.

All these innovative solutions provide a wide range of opportunities to 
investors, developers and users of the platform.

DAO PlayMarket 2.0 is a step into the future of mobile app stores.



14. RISK FACTORS 

Acquisition of tokens is associated with a high 
degree of risk, including, but not limited to, 
the risks listed below. Before acquiring tokens, 
each recipient of this offer should carefully 
weigh all the information and risks outlined 
in this Whitepaper, in particular, the following 
risk factors:

1. Dependence on computer infrastructure

The dependence of Ethereum (or any other 
blockchain) on the functioning of software 
apps, computer equipment and the Internet 
means that the PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
cannot guarantee that a failure in the system 
will not affect negatively the operation 
of the platform. Despite the fact that the 
PlayMarket 2.0 platform uses all reasonable 
security measures, the infrastructure can be 
vulnerable to computer viruses, physical and 
electronic hacking, and other similar system 
disruptions. Computer viruses, hacking and 
other similar violations caused by the actions 
of third parties can lead to interruptions, 
delays or suspension of the platform.

2. Limitations of the smart contract

The smart contract technology is still at an 
early stage of development and experimental 
in its nature. This may create significant 
operational, technological, legal, reputational 
and financial risks. Therefore, despite the fact 
that independent third-party audit enhances 
security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit is 
not a guarantee in any way, including any im-
plied or direct assurance that the PlayMarket 
smart contract is in accordance with its 
intended purpose, or that it does not contain 

any shortcomings, weaknesses or other prob-
lems that may cause technical difficulties or 
lead to a complete loss of PMT tokens.

3. Legal risks

Blockchain technologies, including but not 
limited to, the issue of tokens, may be a 
new concept in some jurisdictions that can 
apply existing laws and regulations to it, or 
enact new laws and regulations governing 
blockchain-based applications. Such laws and 
regulations may conflict with the current 
organization of a smart contract that ensures 
the operation of PMT tokens.

4. Sales tax and other taxes

Token holders and mobile app developers may 
be required to pay sales taxes (levied upon 
sale) and other taxes related to transactions 
set out in this document in accordance with 
the law in their countries of residence. In this 
case, the holders of tokens and the mobile 
app developers are solely responsible for the 
compliance with the tax legislation of their 
country of residence and other jurisdictions.

5. Force majeure

The activities of the PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
may be interrupted, suspended or delayed 
due to force majeure circumstances. For 
the purposes of this Whitepaper, the force 
majeure means events and circumstances of 
an extraordinary nature that could not have 
been foreseen by the PlayMarket 2.0 platform, 
and include natural disasters, wars, armed 
conflicts, riots, industrial conflicts, epidem-
ics, mass layoffs, strikes with productivity 
decline, long-term shortages or disruptions 
in electricity supply or telecommunications 
services, actions of the municipal government, 



the government of the region / state and 
federal government, and other circumstances 
that are beyond the reasonable control of the 
PlayMarket 2.0 platform.

6. Price of PMT tokens

The price of purchased PMT tokens can 
vary significantly for various reasons. The 
PlayMarket 2.0 platform does not guarantee 
any specific price of PMT tokens for any 
period of time. The PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
is not responsible for any changes in the price 
of PMT tokens. Assumptions in connection 
with the above include, but not limited to, 
views on future economic, competitive and 
market conditions and business decisions, 
most of which are beyond the control of the 
project team of the PlayMarket 2.0 platform 
and, therefore, difficult to accurately predict. 
Although the project team of the PlayMarket 
2.0 platform considers the assumptions behind 
the preliminary forward-looking statements to 
be reasonable, any of them may turn out to be 
incorrect in the future. Therefore, the project 
team of the PlayMarket 2.0 in no way can 
guarantee that the preliminary forward-look-
ing statements given in this Whitepaper will 
be accurate. Due to the considerable inherent 
uncertainty of preliminary forward-looking 
statements contained in this document, the 
inclusion of such information cannot be inter-
preted as a guarantee from the PlayMarket 2.0 
platform or any other legal entity that the goals 
and plans of the PlayMarket 2.0 platform proj-
ect will be successfully implemented. Please, 
take into account that the PlayMarket 2.0 
platform project may be subject to other risks 
that the project management cannot foresee at 
present.
