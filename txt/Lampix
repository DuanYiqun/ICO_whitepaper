EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Project Overview  

Quality Computer vision is an enabler for a very large set of applications, among which 

many are in the AR space. One such application is Lampix, a hardware and software solution 

that transforms any surface into a smart, augmented reality surface freeing human-

computer interaction from digital screens. The Lampix platform is poised to be the 

foundation for the next generation of user experiences in retail, office, gaming, and many 

more environments by bridging the gap between the physical and the digital. 

Computer vision and machine learning - Datasets 

While the Lampix device is unique in its form factor, it relies on computer vision algorithms 

to recognize objects in the physical world and create augmented reality. This is similar to 

quite a few other AR systems (glasses, tablet-based, etc.), they all need to understand what 

they see before being able to augment that. This understanding requires large datasets of 

examples, such that algorithms (eg. Deep neural networks) can be trained to do the 

recognition. 

While working on Lampix we realized the scarcity of such datasets. We were missing a 

general-purpose market for such datasets with a self-balanced demand & supply system. 

We always ended up gathering the data ourselves (and actually created software to do this 

comfortably on Lampix). But the idea of the general purpose market got stuck in our heads, 

and hence we started building the PIX ecosystem. 

Where do we need help? 

We are building the “PIX ecosystem”, which is the first blockchain-based 'image mining' 

network for augmented reality and other computer vision systems. To enable Lampix and 

other AR devices to reach their full potential we need to build a billion-image-and-

description database, which will help in training algorithms for classification, detection and 

segmentation. 

Why is this important? 

Computer vision and machine learning are completely dependent on the availability of data, 

which is curated and described. We are therefore building the largest database of computer 



Page 5 of 85

vision and machine-learning data composed of images with descriptions and segmentation 

maps. 

Autonomous and fully automated 

To build a large enough database that is meaningful it has to be built in an autonomous 

fashion. No central party has the means and capability of checking every single image and 

description for details. Therefore, voting and verification mechanisms that are distributed 

are the keys. 

Decentralized 

Data needs can be different from one environment to another. However, some data might 

actually be useful in more than one environment. The database relies on local providers and 

local consumers of the data. Our ecosystem can support both scenarios and will balance 

itself towards the most useful data. This would be most effectively and economically 

achieved through decentralization.  

A market 

For the database to be useful in a timely manner, we are building an efficient token-based 

market, which will reward people who provide data to the database and will charge people 

modestly for the usage of the data. We call this token as “PIX” which will be a digital 

currency used for the transactions within the market.  

Lampix device is the first commercial use case for the market for computer vision datasets. 

While Lampix will be the easiest way to submit or consume data, any other computer vision 

or machine learning system will also be able to interact, through an open API, with the 

database and earn tokens or pay for the usage in tokens.  

Existing traction and potential 

With Lampix, our initial focus is on the enterprise sector, and we plan to do the same with 

the PIX ecosystem. Lampix is already generating revenue and great traction in this sector. 

Our first product on Lampix is an in-store product recommendation system being used by a 

large retail company. We are working on the first office applications together with 

Bloomberg and NYC Media Lab.  

Lampix was accelerated at Highway1 in San Francisco (http://highway1.io/startup/lampix/) 

and the winner of AR & VR startup competition at SXSW (Festival, 2017). We were also

featured at TechCrunch Disrupt and by a few other media outlets. Through this, we already 

have a pipeline of 185 companies many of whom are in the Fortune 100. 

We will leverage this pipeline and extend it to the PIX ecosystem. 

The token launch 

We are doing a crowdsale of our token, which we call “PIX”  to start on August 9 2017. This 

will probably be the first "image mining, augmented reality" project built on top of Ethereum 

blockchain. 

For image miners, we are going to charge PIX tokens to get a Lampix device and pay tokens 

to mine useful {image, description, segmentation} sets. We will also pay users in tokens to 

vote on these images. We use computer vision algorithms to approve or reject images 

before they are submitted to the vote. People will also use the tokens to purchase Lampix 

apps or earn PIX token by creating Lampix apps.  

Our Vision 

“Our vision is a Lampix in every home, office, store, and factory.”  

Our Mission 

“Our mission is to free humans from digital screens.” 

Objectives 

• To raise at least $60 million through a token crowd sale, for the development of the PIX 

ecosystem and Lampix as the reference platform for PIX 

• To build a billion-image-and-description database by the end of 2018

INTRODUCTION 

Computer vision is completely dependent on the availability of quality datasets for training 

and testing algorithms. There are a few databases of datasets currently available in the 

market that can be utilized for this purpose. However, these existing databases are made 

for specific purposes and often found to be proprietary, expensive, or unobtainable.  

Our solution to this problem is to build a large database of computer vision datasets 

composed of images with descriptions, which will be independent of any central control.  

We want to create a digital currency token, “PIX”, that will reflect the value of modern 

computer vision datasets. The database together with the PIX token will create an 

ecosystem where the dataset creators will earn out of creating datasets while dataset users 

have a single place and market to access this data. 

Lampix as a the reference for PIX 

To get the best of the PIX ecoystem and platform, we need a reference implementation 

which showcases the usage of PIX in all possible ways. As we have been working on Lampix 

for a few years now and the idea of PIX came while doing this, we will use Lampix as this 

reference device and platform.  

Lampix contains a projector, a camera, and a cloud-connected computer. We have already 

applied for a provisional patent for the device, which is currently pending.

Lampix makes these use cases possible with the use of computer vision, machine learning 

and datasets exactly as those which will be mined in the PIX ecosystem.  

The PIX Token 

The PIX token puts a value in computer vision datasets. This value will be reflected in the 

core of many final products such as Lampix, but also any other AR device or system. 

We are building a crowd-mined {image, description, segmentation} database of at least one 

billion images on the blockchain. This will probably be the first "image mining” augmented 

reality project built on top of Ethereum blockchain. 

Based on experiences of companies like Google with their machine vision database of 1-

billion-data points seems to be a size that is meaningful and useful for a large set of 

systems and applications. Therefore, we want to build a billion-image-and-description 

database. 

The Ecosystem 

The ecosystem created by PIX token and Lampix device will pave the way to a new market 

where the value of PIX is ultimately determined by the market forces of demand and supply 

of datasets on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, when the demand for datasets grows, 

the value of PIX will also go up similar to any other open market mechanism.  

This ecosystem will function without any central authority or control. It takes care of all the 

stages of a dataset during its lifetime from the creation to the consumption by users.  

We believe that this ecosystem will become the central marketplace of datasets for the 

augmented reality market for the development of different AR applications and products 

other than our Lampix.

THE PROBLEM 

Quality computer vision relies heavily on quality datasets for training and testing 

algorithms. Algorithms themselves are quickly becoming commodity, but this is not the case 

for data1. 

While there are a few databases of datasets currently in the market, there is no unified 

market for this purpose. In addition, there is no standardized way of dealing with such data 

and no proper way of requesting such data from a community or user base, not even in 

exchange for money. 

Further, more interestingly, these datasets are for a specific purpose, the lower the chance 

that they are actually nonproprietary, and thus they are expensive or unobtainable. It may 

be easy to find a dataset with 10,000 general-purpose object classes; but it could be 

difficult to find datasets for a specific requirement of a user/manufacturer. 

We came across these problems while working on Lampix, which is itself a platform that 

commoditizes the AR space and can make good use of such datasets for the most diverse 

applications, such as in retail, for distinguishing and augmenting products on shelves in 

stores. 

Other AR products can also benefit from such datasets in similar ways. The types of data 

included are not limited to 2D images but can also include 3D artifacts.

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

THE SOLUTION 

The PIX token puts a value in datasets. The value is reflected is the core of many final 

products, which already include great algorithms. Good datasets enable them and makes 

them useful. Lampix is great example for a product that can make use of a good datasets 

for various real-life uses. 

We want to create a currency that expresses exactly the value of modern computer vision 

datasets. Because we have experience with Lampix and we already have a market and 

traction for it, we are initially focusing the dataset market on indoor objects such as things 

that sits around our desks or on the shelves in stores. 

However, this is just the beginning. The datasets will extend and expand. The market for 

datasets will grow. Supply and demand will always put a correct price on datasets. Dataset 

creators will earn tokens by creating datasets, and be incentivized to specialize in and 

become more efficient at dataset creation. 

Dataset users have a single place and market to access this data, vote on its quality and 

submit requests for new datasets or dataset extensions suiting their needs. 

The decentralized blockchain based structure of the database will guarantee that the data 

will always be public and uncontrolled by a single entity. Once mined, every mined item will 

stay public forever.  

Lampix itself is a very good tool for creating many such types of datasets and comes with 

the right apps that enable exactly this task.

THE PRODUCT 

Image Mining and PIX Smart Contracts 

We are building a crowd-mined {image, description, segmentation} database of at least one 

billion sets on the blockchain. We believe this database should be independent of any 

central control. We believe the right mechanism to encourage mining is to pay miners for 

their labor. We believe we should also charge users a smaller amount for using the data in 

the database. Optionally, we will also provide miners with a mining rig (a Lampix device). 

For all these reasons, we need a token to help tie together this economy; we refer to this 

token as PIX. There are multiple modules used in the general architecture of this ecosystem 

as given below: 

• The data storage database module 

• The {image, description, segmentation} tree module 

• The {image, description, segmentation} tree branch creation module 

• The gateway, data submission module  

• The smart contract for mining module 

• The voting mechanism module 

• The smart contract for voting module 

• The data access/usage module 

• The smart contract for data usage module 

• The Lampix GAS smart contract module (PIX tokens used to support cloud resources 

for Lampix devices) 

• The Lampix APP submission module 

• The Lampix APP download module 

• The Lampix APP smart contract   

• The token sale smart contract module 

It is not the purpose of this white paper to detail every single module. Given below is a 

simplified diagram with a simplified flow.

Image: Simplified diagram of the general architecture of the ecosystem 

 

High-Level View of the Process  

Every miner, voter, and user will be associated with a wallet address. 

Ø Tree of requirements 

To instruct miners what {image, description, segmentation} sets are useful; a requirement 

tree will be put in place. Here is an example of such tree from ImageNet2, a similar 

database.

Image: An example of requirements tree 

 

Source: ImageNet 

The Lampix ecosystem makes the best usage of images of objects on a flat surface indoors. 

The Lampix team will, therefore, populate a starting tree with PIX bounties. Each tree 

branch, sub-branch and so on will have a particular bounty attached to it which will be the 

value the miners can earn by mining that entire branch.  

Beyond the Lampix needs, anybody else with a PIX balance and a wallet address will be able 

to create their own branches with a PIX bounty attached to them. The creator will then be 

able to decide how much they are willing to pay for that set and how much they will charge 

potential users for the set. In order for the infrastructure to be supported the tree smart 

contract will, however, charge a small percentage of those fees to pay for the upkeep of the 

system. 



Page 28 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

Through the blockchain and smart contract system, users can get data from different 

branches owned by different owners, while at the same time having a completely 

transparent process, with each owner knowing for sure they will earn their fair share of PIX 

for the data they paid for to mine. 

This approach can, of course, be enlarged beyond {image, description, segmentation} 

mining for any usages like sound, other media, or maybe even general human work like the 

Amazon Mechanical Turk3 which could be migrated to the blockchain. 

Ø Image Acquisition 

Any miner will be able to submit sets of {image, description, segmentation}. The images 

will have to be of sufficient resolution (32 bits, format JPG) and the description will have to 

be in XML format. 

The submission will be done directly to the database pre-processing mechanism. 

The submission is done via a Graphical User Interface program pre-loaded and pre-

configured on the Lampix device. All users need to have a Lampix device to mine by 

following directions such as:  

1. Enter the wallet address 

2. Choose what objects you are mining from the tree using a simple pointer/menu 

navigation process 

3. Press a key to start 

4. Place object1 here (Lampix will highlight an area on the table). 

5. Press a key when object is in place 

6. Now move object to new location (Lampix highlighted it) 

7. Press a key again 

 

Ø Pre-processing (in gateway) 

All new incoming sets of {image, description, segmentation} will be received by the 

database watchdog, the input mechanism. The input module will apply basic image 

processing algos to sift through the submissions: 

• Detect duplicate image  

• Detect image already in database 

                                            
3 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome 



Page 29 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

• Detect image too similar to existing image in database 

The purpose of this sifting will be to remove an obviously wrong submission or to save 

unnecessary voting costs. 

 

Ø Voting and set entry in the database 

One will have to verify if the {image, description, segmentations} sets are accurate and 

correct. Humans are best positioned to make this verification at this time (until the Lampix 

database is large enough so that computer vision and machine learning will be able to do 

the voting themselves).  

As implemented by Augur REP4 tokens, voting on a image will receive payment in PIX 

tokens. A few voting features: 

• People will vote to decide if the image content matches the XML description content 

• The voting choices will be binary: YES/NO 

• The first vote will receive the largest payment 

• Later votes will receive smaller payments 

• Consensus will be reached when there are X times more votes in one direction than 

the other 

• Once consensus is reached the {image, description, segmentation} set will be 

committed to the database 

• Payments will then be triggered via the smart contracts to the miner and the voters 

who voted in the direction of the consensus 

• Voters who voted against the consensus will not receive payment 

• If a wallet address votes consistently against the consensus it will be charged PIX 

tokens in fact, per the smart contract. This will be in place in order to avoid random 

voting or abuse 

 

Ø Payment 

Our financial model is based on the following assumptions: 

• The easiest way to mine {image, description, segmentation} sets is by using a 

Lampix device

Page 30 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

• One should be able to make back the Lampix purchase cost by mining at a 

reasonable workload for about 2 months 

• Voting should be paid less than mining but sufficient for people to be interested to 

vote 

As you can see in our financial model details we have come up with a temporary, order of 

magnitude, payments amounts in PIX and USD for the mining and voting. 

All payments will be done via the blockchain in PIX tokens, in real time once the right 

conditions are met. 

Ø Image usage 

Upon entry in the database, each set will be associated to a hash which will be written on a 

blockchain. 

Any wallet address with sufficient balance in PIX will be able to request any data from the 

database and pay directly via a smart contract for accessing it. Upon receipt, the user can 

verify the data integrity by comparing its data hash vs. the hashes in the blockchain for the 

data they requested. 

Ø Smart contracts 

All smart contracts, where applicable, will follow the ERC:20 standards. If new standards are 

approved by the Ethereum community in the future, such standards will be used. 

All smart contracts will also be audited by third parties as much as reasonable.

Potential Commercial Applications 

The potential applications of PIX token or the value of the datasets can be endless. The PIX 

ecosystem can provide computer vision datasets for various commercial applications of AR 

applications and products 

Some ideas and use cases of the PIX ecosystem in different industries are explained below. 

Most of these use cases are already proved practical in real life with our own device, 

Lampix.  

Ø Meeting and Collaboration 

We can make meetings and collaborations easier and more efficient with the following 

features:  

Collaboration for remote meetings – We can share a live stream to the paper document 

you are working on and enable instant visual (projected) feedback on that document from 

your collaborators. Our Lampix device has already done this. 

Image: Lampix live streaming to a paper document 

 

Collaborative data exploration – We can present data in an interactive pivot table, 

allowing the rows, columns, and groupings to be manipulated by moving physical objects. 



Page 32 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

Use the table as a whiteboard – We can enable annotations on digital documents, which 

are projected, as well as scanning of physical documents, such as post-it notes. 

Redlining – We can mix digital content (such as diagrams or diagram elements) with 

physical content (such as markup or element connections) on a whiteboard. Transfer the 

markup back to the original documents. 

Voting – We can show a voting interface directly on the table, in any meeting room, 

allowing meeting participants to easily vote and have the results available instantly. 

Ø Gaming Industry 

We can take regular screen based gaming into a new dimension by projecting the games on 

a larger surface and mixing them with reality. For instance, we can: 

• Play a game on any surface with friends 

• Increase engagement and entertainment  

• Include everyday physical objects in the games 

• Move from screen focused games to environmental aware games

Ø Office 

In addition to meeting and collaboration, we can use datasets from PIX ecosystem to 

improve the efficiency of office day-to-day functions with different AR products and 

applications. Given below are some of the usage examples: 

Scanning - We can easily scan the document with a simple tap and directly send to your 

computer or online storage. 

Transform office desks - We can transform our office desk surface into a pin board or 

different visualization medium. We can freeze a document’s image on the table and bind 

digital content to the documents. We can then recall physical documents based on the 

digital labels you have given them. 

Business Cards - We can recognize business cards, project the LinkedIn profile of the 

business card owners and send, in one-step, follow-up emails. For instance, we can send 

“nice to meet” by pressing one button and ask for an appointment. 

Computer/mobile notifications – We can show the notification from the computer or 

mobile (mail, messages, etc.) which we can dismiss or see more information.

Ø Retail Industry 

Retail sector can make use datasets from PIX ecosystem in brick and mortar stores to 

create AR products and applications to increase the sales potential. Some of the potential 

use cases are given below: 

A new experience for customers - We can easily mix real products with digitally 

projected content to tell a compelling story about the products. 

A familiar environment yet surprising - Nearly any existing store surface can be 

transformed into an interactive surface. 

Product guidance – We can explain how, for example, a coffee machine is used step by 

step, by projecting on the machine itself to highlight buttons and other control elements. 

Product information - Retail products placed on a surface would result in display of 

product information, which can also be interactive, for example, it can contain buttons 

leading to further categories of information. 

Digitize and share - Latte art, after a cup of coffee is recognized on the table. Let users 

connect to Lampix by scanning a personalized QR code, after that they can share content 

from Lampix (such as a nice Latte art) on one of their social media channels. 

Product recommendation wizard – We can guide the user through a set of multiple-

choice questions (like a survey), and depending on what was chosen, show 

recommendations by highlighting real products (overlaid projection).

Ø Restaurant Industry 

PIX ecosystem can provide the restaurant industry with necessary datasets to come up with 

various AR products and applications, which can improve the efficiency and user experience. 

Given below are some of the example uses. 

Menu display on table – we can display the whole menu on the table, which makes the 

ordering process much faster and easier. Customers will not need to wait for a waiter to 

bring a menu. 

Engage with customers – we can improve the engagement with the customers. For 

instance, we could play a simple game until the order arrives. 

Faster billing – We can display the bill on the table and payment can be made online, all 

on the table.

Ø Homes 

PIX ecosystem can provide datasets for AR products and applications, which can make 

smarter homes. The potential uses are only limited by imagination. We can turn any surface 

into a smart surface For instance, imagine having your recipe on the table you cook, without 

worrying about putting your dirty hands on a keyboard or mouse or on a paper. Further, 

imagine placing some kind of produce like a tomato on the kitchen table and then projecting 

an assortment of cuisine styles and recipes around it inspiring you to find new ideas.

Lampix as a Platform  

Lampix will be the first device to make use of the PIX ecosystem to create and improve AR 

applications for various uses, some of which have already been implemented by Lampix. 

Lampix can be the best tool to build up the database of computer vision datasets on the 

blockchain as a producer or a consumer due to following reasons: 

Ø Lampix uses much simpler hardware than existing technologies while still enabling the 

same applications and much more. It is based on recent advances in computer vision 

and machine learning. Lampix is using a visible spectrum camera and the latest 

advances in computer vision. This allows us to detect human fingers and also objects 

and movements with very simple hardware. By using a projector, we also create 

augmented reality without glasses.  

 

Ø Lampix uses an Android-based software platform. It comes with APIs and you can take 

any HTML content and make it responsive to objects and finger movement/gestures. You 

can also use a low-level Android API to create much more powerful applications. It 

comes with several ready-made apps intended for office functions. We are also releasing 



Page 38 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

the source code of these apps so anyone who wants to develop an app can get started 

faster.  

 
 

Ø Lampix lowers the upfront effort to develop augmented reality applications by offering a 

comprehensive framework covering every aspect of computer vision and AI to interface 

design. In its simplest form, the Lampix API allows taking any HTML 5 page and tagging 

elements, those elements will then react to the input from the physical world such as 

movement, physical objects, or fingers. The framework allows users to train Lampix to 

recognize different object classes within minutes. Users can, therefore, make HTML 5 

content that is projected on a flat surface and which is controlled via physical objects 

and fingers. For even more freedom, a low-level Android API is also available.  

 

Ø Lampix empowers any HTML5 page to react to objects, fingers, and movement by 

means of a few simple attributes and a JavaScript library. We are currently developing a 

training app that streamlines the learning of new object classes. This will enable all 

developers to make AR apps within hours. Our CTO made a proof of concept of an AR 

tower defense game in 8 hours. We are also working on an Android SDK with specific 

Lampix extensions to enable even more powerful apps. Lampix will have a dedicated 

“App Store” where app developers can publish their apps. 

Lampix Hardware 

We designed Lampix with form and function as top priorities. LED lights lined the top for 

indirect soft lighting. Under the shade, you will find color LEDs that fill a room with a glow 

as well as a separate desk light. The core of Lampix is a Raspberry Pi 3 board, which can 

control two cameras, one video, one high-resolution projector and the lighting fixtures. 

Technical specifications of the Lampix Device: 
 
§ Diagonal view: about 1m 

§ Camera resolution: 8mp 

§ OCR plausible on 18px fonts 

§ Current option: lower Lampix => smaller area, bigger resolution

TOKEN MECHANISM 

Crowdsale Token Launch (CTL)/ICO 

Many people refer to a crowdsale token launch (CTL) as an ICO, Initial Coin Offering. A 

crowdsale token launch is a way for companies to raise capital by issuing their own 

cryptocurrency, which is usually used on a company’s platform.  

As you can read in Fortune17: “Renowned venture capitalists like Chris Dixon of Andreessen 

Horowitz and Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures now tout ICOs as a new form of 

corporate financing.“ 

“In the second quarter [of 2017], ICO issuance was greater than venture capital, with $210 

million [invested in ICOs] versus $180 million [invested into startups by VCs]. We do expect 

that transition to continue; it’s why we’re doing what we’re doing.” From TechCrunch18. 

Initial Coin Offerings can be considered as an alternative form of fundraising that has 

emerged outside of the traditional financial system. This model has helped a lot of 

successful projects and companies get the funding required to start their business. 

However, ICOs have nothing to do at all with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which shares 

are being sold to the public.   

How CTL Tokens are traded 

Once the CTL is completed and the project launched, the ICO tokens can get listed on 

cryptocurrency exchanges to trade against other cryptocurrencies. The largest exchange by 

volume today is Poloniex19. The price usually reflects the overall cryptocurrency market 

sentiment, project-specific news, and the addition of new features. 

The Lampix Crowd Token Launch (CTL) 

Lampix will crowdsale a token called “PIX”. We are doing a crowdsale token launch (CTL) for 

PIX tokens on August 9th 2017. This will probably be the first "image mining, augmented 

reality" crowdsale token launch.

Each PIX token will be used as a form of payment to image data miners, voters, or to 

purchase a Lampix and cloud computing.  

The CTL is a vital component to bring the Lampix and database to fruition, enabling us to 

build a Lampix ecosystem while also financing users who contribute to the database. The 

database will play a key role in developing augmented reality applications across many 

devices.  

PIX Token radically improves the efficiency of computer vision by creating a new database 

of computer vision and machine learning data that can be used between software 

developers, system engineers, and users. It all happens on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The Ethereum Blockchain 

Ethereum20 is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform 

featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality, which facilitates online contractual 

agreements. It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum 

Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public 

nodes. 

The tokens can be earned by providing data or can be used to obtain a variety of data 

services from the Lampix computer vision and machine learning database. The utility of the 

token is based on distributed decentralized community-vetted user submitted labeled data, 

which simply means a person’s images with labels. 

Computer vision and machine learning 

Lampix uses much simpler hardware than existing technologies while still enabling the same 

applications and much more. It is based on recent advances in computer vision and machine 

learning. The Lampix platform through simple graphic interfaces takes care of the entire 

process from training and object recognition all the way to content creation. 

Where do we need help? 

We are building the first blockchain based computer vision and machine learning database 

for training and usage for objects on indoor flat surfaces.

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

Why is this important? 

Computer vision and machine learning are completely dependent on the availability of data 

which is curated and described. We are therefore building the largest database of computer 

vision and machine learning data composed of images with description.

Having a Lampix device will be the easiest way to do the mining but we also need help 

financing it’s manufacturing at scale.  

We hope people will use Lampix not only to mine but also to enjoy it with applications and 

to develop Lampix apps as well. This will also increase the Lampix user-base which will, 

therefore, encourage developers to build more apps for Lampix and its users.  

Through this mechanism, we enable and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality and 

smart surface for the entire human population. 

Why Crowdsourcing and blockchain? 

Existing databases are controlled by the company who built them. Google, for example, has 

made such a database21. However, there are two problems with this approach: Google 

controls this database and can at any moment forbid their competitors from using it, 

remove access to it, etc. Secondary, this database includes only the data Google thinks is 

needed.  

We want a world where no single company and not Lampix either, will control who has 

access to the data, and what data should go in the database. There is no centralized control. 

This is why we are working on the blockchain. This database will be available to any miners 

or users to who earn or pay PIX tokens. 

What else can the blockchain help with? 

We also plan to include on the blockchain a hash of each image once it is approved and 

entered into the database. This will address 2 concerns: 

1. We want users to know for certain the image has not been tampered with 

2. We want users to know that they used the full data set and no actual image has been 

removed or added. 

This mechanism increases the security of the data in the database. 

Which network will the blockchain portion of the application support? 

On an abstract level, these networks are giant state machines, on which all smart contracts 

run "locally." Therefore, it is more comparable to an OS than a network per se. That is why 

                                            
21 https://research.google.com/youtube8m/index.html 



Page 59 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

we think products will develop to support multiple chains, just as they support iOS, Android, 

Windows, Linux, etc. 

We will for sure support Ethereum to start but we believe we will then support other 

networks as well. 

Why do you submit images? 

You will receive PIX tokens in return for submitting images, approximately on average 

$0.0079 per {image, description, segmentation} set that passes the voting standards and is 

added to the database. 

When does the crowdsale token launch (CTL) start? 

The CTL will begin on August 9th 2017. 

What will be the address and the block for the crowdsale token launch? 

The address and the exact block will be shared a few days before the CTL. 

How do you structure your token launch (CTL)? 

After reading Vitalik’s paper22 on initial token pricing we have decided on a structure that is 

new and we hope will be fairer and will allow more people to participate: 

We are creating 1,100,000,000 PIX tokens. We will sell 50% of the tokens in the token 

launch over 3 days. 

Day 1 we will sell $20mil worth of tokens with a 15% bonus 

Day 2 we will sell $20mil worth of tokens with a 10% bonus 

Day 3 to 10 we will sell $20mil worth of token with a 5% bonus 

We will put 30% of the token in reserve and we are using 20% of the token for the team, 

partners. 

Please see our financial model for full details on the tokens. We need to raise roughly $50 

million to make any surface a smart surface in the next 4 to 5 years. 

Is there a pre-sale ?

bonus. This is limited to $15mil. The amount bought will be deducted from the 1st day’s 

$20mil. 

How much is a PIX at launch? 

One PIX is equivalent to $0.12 during the Crowdsale Token Launch. 

What is the total amount of PIX Issued? 

There is a total supply of approximately one billion PIX tokens. The following is how the 

tokens are going to be distributed: 

• Issued: 50% of the tokens will be issued for the ICO 

• Reserves: 30% will be used for data purchase 

• Company/Team: 20% will be used for research and development 

When will PIX tokens be distributed and then sold on the secondary market? 

We expect to distribute PIX two weeks post crowdsale token launch and make it available on 

the secondary market within a month. 

What will make the token value? 

PIX tokens’ value stems from the time/effort put into mining the {image, description, 

segmentation} couples. 

Moreover, the PIX token is the gas to drive your Lampix to do vision and machine learning 

with the help of cloud computing power. PIX tokens are used to pay for the cloud computing 

service at a rate of $9.00 per a month. But you can also use the PIX tokens to pay for data 

for any other Augmented Reality system. 

The demand for PIX will increase the value of it on the secondary market. 

How will the reserve be used? 

The tokens set in reserve will be under the following rules: 

1. 25% will be locked for 12 months 

2. 25% will be locked for 24 months 

3. 25% will be locked for 36 months 

4. 25% will be locked for 48 months 

5. At each release of tokens

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

a) 30% will be used for data acquisition costs, development, marketing and other 

corporate needs. 

b) 50% will be allocated to acquire other companies, patent needs, and IP needs 

c) 10% will be allocated to external partners if needed 

d) 10% will be distributed to all PIX token holders (air drop) proportionally to their 

then holdings in PIX tokens. 

How will the Teams’ tokens be used? 

Tokens set aside for the team (20% of total) will be used as follows: 

• 25% of them will be available in the same time as for the public, roughly 1 month 

after the CTL. 

• 25% of them will be locked for 12 months 

• 25% of them will be locked for 24 months 

• 25% of them will be locked for 36 months 

Why are you locking the team’s reserve? 

Because we want to demonstrate that we are in this for the long run and that the team’s 

incentives are aligned with the token holder’s interest.

Lampix Database Platform 

Why do we need a {image, description, segmentation} database? 

Any application that uses computer vision and machine learning (example: self-driving cars, 

Google Glasses, HoloLens, MetaGlasses, other augmented reality systems, etc.) needs to be 

trained. Three types of data are needed: training, validation, and testing. 

It is like training a human baby to talk: you need to show them, say what it is, and make 

the baby repeat and verify that what they said is accurate or correct it.  

There are two parts in making the perfect computer vision system: a lot of data and good 

algorithms. 

It takes a lot of data in different contexts to train a good computer vision system.  

We believe using crowdsourcing and blockchain is the best approach to building such a 

database. 

Why Crowdsourcing and blockchain? 

Existing databases are controlled by the company who built them. Google, for example, has 

made such a database23. However, there are two problems with this approach: Google 

controls this database and can at any moment forbid their competitors from using it, 

remove access to it, etc. Secondary, this database includes only the data Google thinks is 

needed.  

We want the world where no single company, and not Lampix neither, will control who has 

access to the data, and what data should go in the database. No centralized control. This is 

why we are working on the blockchain. This database will be available to any miners or 

users to who earn or pay PIX tokens. 

What else can the blockchain help with? 

We also plan to include on the blockchain a hash of each image once it is approved and 

entered into the database. This will address 2 concerns: 

1. We want users to know for certain the image has not been tampered with. 

                                            
23 https://research.google.com/youtube8m/index.html 



Page 63 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

2. And we want users to know that they used the full data set and no actual image has been 

removed or added. 

This mechanism increases the security of the data in the database. 

Why do we need a billion images database? 

Based on experiences of companies like Google with their machine vision database 1-billion-

data points seems to be a size that is meaningful and useful for a large set of systems and 

applications. 

Why do you submit images? 

You will receive PIX tokens in return for submitting images, approximately $0.0079 per 

{image, description, segmentation} set that pass the voting standards and is added to the 

database.  

How do you prevent people from submitting the same image? 

Out database will run a test against existing images to rule this option out. 

Why submit images when I can make more money voting? 

You make approx. 4x more PIX tokens submitting {image, description, segmentation} set at 

the same amount of work. 

What is voting and why would you do it? 

Voting is the process of agreeing on the description and image match. Voting allows users 

to contribute to the database with up votes or down votes while also being paid in PIX 

tokens. 

Why would someone vote on the images? 

Because you get paid in tokens.  

How do you prevent "hater" votes or people just randomly voting? 

Voters will only receive PIX tokens if their vote aligns with the consensus of the image.  

How do we decide what image classes are needed? 

Like in existing databases we will create a tree of categories that we are willing to pay for. 

We will attach a token value to each branch, sub-branch, and leaf. Other people can also 



Page 64 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

add branches to the tree and attach PIX tokens bounties on them for the crowd to mine the 

{image,description} for the branch. 

Other than earning PIX tokens, what is the benefit from creating this database?  

Any other Augmented reality systems like HoloLens or Google Glasses will be able to use 

this database (and pay for it in PIX) to access it. We believe Augmented Reality will 

revolutionize humanity more than Virtual Reality and will change how we interact with 

technology. 

Lampix Device 

Why do you want smart surfaces or Augmented Reality? 

The ability to transform any surface into an interactive computer (augmented reality) is 

going to unleash applications we have not even conceived of. Think how much smartphones 

changed how we live. This is going to be a similar impact. A few examples of many include 

remotely interacting with a co-worker’s strategic plan on paper and then uploading it to a 

shareable document, ordering food at a restaurant, to even having fun playing a game of 

chess. Take a look at our YouTube channel24 to see some examples in action. Ultimately, the 

goal of augmented reality is to make tasks easier to execute and/or more exciting. 

How do you buy a Lampix device? Can I use PIX tokens or fiat? 

You buy a Lampix device with PIX Tokens. However, you can use your credit card, which will 

automatically convert local fiat into PIX. Once you have a device you can earn the Tokens 

back by mining images for the database. 

Is it compulsory to have a Lampix device for mining? 

No. you do not have to use Lampix for mining but it is probably the easiest way.  

What sort of computing power is required for mining? 

That there is no computing required. Mining in this context is much more similar to mining 

diamonds than Bitcoin mining. 

Why should someone care about a database which is just used to make Lampix 

better?

Any other Augmented reality systems like HoloLens or Google Glasses will be able to use 

this database (and pay for it in PIX) to access it. We believe Augmented Reality will 

revolutionize humanity more than Virtual Reality and will change how we interact with 

technology. 

In addition, as the Lampix data ecosystem grows, the more applications can be made, 

which will make your Lampix experience even more exciting and useful.  

What is the basic unit of value for the PIX token? (Such as user's attention in BAT 

or gold used to be for money) 

PIX tokens’ value stems from the time/effort put into mining the {image,description} 

couples. 

Moreover, the PIX token is the gas to drive your Lampix to do vision and machine learning 

with the help of cloud computing power. PIX tokens are used to pay for the cloud computing 

service at a rate of $9.00 per a month. But you can also use the PIX tokens to pay for data 

for any other Augmented Reality system. 

What is meant by "for each submitted image you get 30 images free"? 

We are often asked how do you price mining and use the images. The idea is that one 

image submitted will come in handy for multiple people, therefore the price should be lower.  

We use this rule of thumb of you get as many tokens for submitting a image as you have to 

pay to download 30 images. 

Why would you need 30 images, what would you do with them?  

Images are used to train computer vision systems. If you are building a computer vision 

system you will need tens of thousands or more {image, description, segmentation} sets to 

train and test your system. The sets are not useful unless you are building such a system. 

People who build Lampix apps, for example, will sometimes need to use these sets.  

How does the token scheme take advantage of the distributed/decentralized 

nature of Ethereum? 

We are doing {image, description, segmentation} sets mining. For each set submitted, we 

will first run some computer vision algorithms to discard doubles and obviously not correct 

images. We will then ask the distributed user base to vote on the images to make sure the 



Page 66 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

image and description match. And everybody (miners and voters) is paid once the set has 

been accepted in the database. 

Why is there a need to buy data for machine learning from this database? 

Lampix is just one platform among many others in this market. This database can be used 

for other platforms like HoloLens, Google Glasses, and any other AR platform as well.  

How do you pay for Ethereum gas? 

We need to pay for Ethereum gas when we make PIX payments. We will simply charge in 

PIX at each transaction to pay for it exactly like ETH. Therefore, if you send 10 pix the 

receiver will likely receive about 9.999 PIX 

Financial Model 

Is Token sale your revenue? Isn’t it like your equity capital? 

The token sale is our revenue. 

Retail sector - Are you assuming that all the users are required to subscribe to the 

cloud?  

Yes, all users need cloud access as most of the computer vision is done in the cloud. 

Retail sector- Is the app price recurring monthly? Or are you assuming each user 

to buy 3 apps each Month? 

No, it is a one-time fee, each user will buy about 3 apps per month at $1 each. 

For more customization, a customer needs to spend $5k to get Lampix in their shop/location 

to do something they want. It is based on our present experiences. 

Small business sector - All the small businesses are developing an app. Is this 

realistic?  

More customize, aka spend $5k to get Lampix in their shop/location to do something they 

want. I think it is based on present experience.  

Why is most of the revenue coming from small businesses?  



Page 67 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

In general small businesses represent larger sales but fewer sales. Retail represents smaller 

sales but more sales.  We have about 1 year of experience selling Lampix to businesses and 

we built our financial model based on that experience.   

Strategic sector - B2B project large scale - Excel formula appears to consider small 

scale 10% also. Is this correct?   

Yes, it is, as only 10% of those who do a small scale will also do strategic, we think. 

How to you decide on the cost of a mined image as $0.007891? 

This cost figure is arrived at with the following assumptions: 

• A user will need to recover the cost of Lampix device in two months (i.e. $250 per 

month) 

• User can work time per month is 316,800 in seconds (i.e. 04 hours a day for 22 

days) 

• Time required to mine a image is 10 seconds 

• Number of images per user per month is then 31,680 (i.e. 316800/10) 

Now the cost to be recovered a month ($250) divided by no of images a month (i.e. 31680) 

gives us the cost of mined image, which is $0.007891. 

Legal 

What is our legal name? 

Smart Lamp Inc., Delaware Corp. 

Do you have AML/KYC policies? 

Yes, we do. We are going to implement the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering and 

Know Your Client to fend off money laundering and will report any suspicious activities to 

local financial intelligence units such as FINCE. 

What regions are you serving? 

We are serving the global market for anyone who is interested in Lampix and wants to be a 

part of the growing augmented reality ecosystem.  

Do token holders get an equity stake? 

No. Token holders do not get any equity ownership.

PATENT INFORMATION 

Lampix has already applied for a provisional patent and the content of the same is given 

below. 

PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FOR METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING USER 

INTERFACES WITH COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS AND INTERACTING  

WITH A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT  

Background of the Invention 

The present invention relates to the fields of augmented reality and user interfaces for 

computerized systems.  Augmented reality technologies allow virtual imagery to be 

presented in real-world physical environments.  The present invention allows users to 

interact with these virtual images to perform various functions. 

The personal computer has been a huge boon for productivity, adapting to the needs of a 

wide variety of personal and professional endeavors.  Despite the ongoing evolution of 

personal computing, one divide is persistent.  Physical documents and digital files interact in 

limited ways.  People need to interrupt their workflow to print files or scan documents, and 

changes in one realm are not reflected across mediums.  Many types of user interface 

devices and methods are available, including the keyboard, mouse, joystick, and touch 

screen, but computers and digital information have limited interaction with a user’s physical 

workspace and documents.   

Recently, interactive touchscreens have been used for presenting information on flat 

surfaces.  For example, an image may be displayed on a touchscreen, and a user may 

interact with the image by touching the touchscreen, causing the image to change.  

However, in order to interact with the image displayed on the touchscreen, the user must 

actually come in contact with the touchscreen.  By requiring contact with a touchscreen to 

provide interactivity, a large number of potential users are not engaged by current 

interactive displays.  Since only one user may interact with a touchscreen at a time, 

additional users are also excluded.  Moreover, interactivity is limited by the size and 

proximity of the touchscreen. 

Other systems or methods for interacting with virtual environment rely on image processing 

rather than tactile interfaces.  Image processing is used in many areas of analysis, 

education, commerce, and entertainment.  One aspect of image processing includes human-



Page 71 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

computer interaction by motion capture or detecting human forms and movements to allow 

interaction with images through motion capture techniques.  Applications of such processing 

can use efficient or entertaining ways of interacting with images to define digital shapes or 

other data, animate objects, create expressive forms, etc. 

With motion capture techniques, mathematical descriptions of a human performer's 

movements are input to a computer or other processing system.  Natural body movements 

can be used as inputs to the computer to study athletic movement, capture data for later 

playback or simulation, enhance analysis for medical purposes, etc. 

Although motion capture provides benefits and advantages, motion capture techniques tend 

to be complex.  Some techniques require the human actor to wear special suits with high-

visibility points at several locations.  Other approaches use radio-frequency or other types of 

emitters, multiple sensors, and detectors, blue-screens, extensive post-processing, etc.  

Techniques that rely on simple visible-light image capture are usually not accurate enough 

to provide well-defined and precise motion capture. 

More recently, patterned illumination has been used to discern physical characteristics like 

an object’s size, shape, orientation, or movement.  These systems generally project infrared 

light, or other nonvisible spectra, which is then captured by a visual sensor sensitive to the 

projected light.  As an example, U.S.  Pat.  No.  8,035,624, whose disclosure is incorporated 

herein by reference, describes a computer vision based touch screen, in which an 

illuminator illuminates an object near the front side of a screen, a camera detects 

interaction of an illuminated object with an image separately projected onto the screen by a 

projector, and a computer system directs the projector to change the image in response to 

the interaction. 

Other similar systems include an interactive video display system, U.S.  Patent No. 

7,834,846, in which a display screen displays a visual image, and a camera captures 3D 

information regarding an object in an interactive area located in front of the display screen.  

A computer system directs the display screen to change the visual image in response to 

changes in the object.   

Yet another method is the Three-Dimensional User Interface Session Control, U.S.  Patent 

No. 9,035,876, in which a computer executes a non-tactile three dimensional (3D) user 

interface, a set of multiple 3D coordinates representing a gesture by a hand positioned 

within a field of view of a sensing device coupled to the computer, the gesture including a 

first motion in a first direction along a selected axis in space, followed by a second motion in 



Page 72 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

a second direction, opposite to the first direction, along the selected axis.  Upon detecting 

completion of the gesture, the non-tactile 3D user interface is transitioned from a first state 

to a second state. 

Summary of the Invention 

The invention is a device that delivers the functionality of the personal computer (“PC”) to 

the physical desktop.  The device provides seamless integration between paper and digital 

documents, creating an augmented office space beyond the limited screens of current 

devices.  The invention makes an entire desk or office space interactive, allowing for greater 

versatility in user-computer interactions.  The invention provides these benefits without 

adding additional obtrusive hardware to the office space.  Contained within a lighting fixture 

or other office fixture, the invention reduces clutter beyond even the slimmest laptops or 

tablets. 

Some portions of the detailed descriptions, which follow, are presented in terms of 

procedures, steps, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations of 

operations on data bits that can be performed on computer memory.  These descriptions 

and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most 

effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.  A procedure, 

computer executed step, logic block, process, etc., is here, and generally, conceived to be a 

self-consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result.  The steps are 

those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities.  Usually, though not 

necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being 

stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a computer system.  

It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to 

these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. 

It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated 

with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these 

quantities.  Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, 

it is appreciated that throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as 

“projecting” or “detecting” or “changing” or “illuminating” or “correcting” or “eliminating” or 

the like, refer to the action and processes of an electronic system (e.g., an interactive video 

system), or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data 

represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the electronic device's registers and 

memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the electronic

device memories or registers, or other such information storage, transmission, or display 

devices. 

Some described embodiments may use a video camera which produces a three-dimensional 

(3D) image of the objects it views.  Time-of-flight cameras have this property.  Other 

devices for acquiring depth information (e.g., 3D image data) include but are not limited to 

a camera paired with structured light, stereo cameras that utilize stereopsis algorithms to 

generate a depth map, ultrasonic transducer arrays, laser scanners, and time-of-flight 

cameras.  Typically, these devices produce a depth map, which is a two-dimensional (2D) 

array of values that correspond to the image seen from the camera's perspective.  Each 

pixel value corresponds to the distance between the camera and the nearest object that 

occupies that pixel from the camera's perspective.  Moreover, while the embodiments of the 

present invention may include at least one time-of-flight camera, it should be appreciated 

that the present invention may be implemented using any camera or combination of 

cameras that are operable to determine three-dimensional information of the imaged 

object, such as laser scanners and stereo cameras. 

The invention uses one or more visual sensors to monitor a workspace.  In one 

embodiment, a visual sensor is a camera that is operable to capture three-dimensional 

information about the object.  In one embodiment, the camera is a time-of-flight camera, a 

range imaging camera that resolves distance based on the speed of light.  In one 

embodiment, the object is a user.  In one embodiment, the distance information is used for 

person tracking.  In one embodiment, the distance information is used for feature tracking.  

Feature tracking would be useful in creating a digital representation of a 3D object and/or 

distinguishing between different 3D objects. 

A workspace may be a desk, chalkboard, whiteboard, drafting table, bookshelf, pantry, cash 

register, checkout area, or other physical space in which a user desires computer 

functionality.  In monitoring the workspace, the device recognizes physical objects—for 

example, documents or books—and presents options for various functions performed by a 

computer on the object.  To present options, the device may utilize a projector.  The 

projector may create an image on a surface of the workspace representing various options 

as menu items by words or other recognizable symbols.  Options may also be presented on 

another device accessible to the users and linked with the present invention—for example, a 

smartphone, tablet, computer, touchscreen monitor, or another input device.

Displayed images or items can include objects, patterns, shapes, or any visual pattern, 

effect, etc.  Aspects of the invention can be used for applications such as interactive lighting 

effects for people at clubs or events, interactive advertising displays, characters and virtual 

objects that react to the movements of passers-by, interactive ambient lighting for public 

spaces such as restaurants, shopping malls, sports venues, retail stores, lobbies and parks, 

video game systems, and interactive informational displays.  Other applications are possible 

and are within the scope of the invention.   

In general, any type of display device can be used in conjunction with the present invention.  

For example, although video devices have been described in the various embodiments and 

configurations, other types of visual presentation devices can be used.  A light-emitting 

diode (LED) array, organic LED (OLED), light-emitting polymer (LEP), electromagnetic, 

cathode ray, plasma, the mechanical or another display system can be employed. 

Virtual reality, three-dimensional, or other types of displays can be employed.  For example, 

a user can wear imaging goggles or a hood so that they are immersed within a generated 

surrounding.  In this approach, the generated display can align with the user's perception of 

their surroundings to create an augmented, or enhanced, reality.  One embodiment may 

allow a user to interact with an image of a character.  The character can be computer 

generated, played by a human actor, etc.  The character can react to the user's actions and 

body position.  Interactions can include speech, co-manipulation of objects, etc. 

Multiple systems can be interconnected via a digital network.  For example, Ethernet, 

Universal Serial Bus (USB), IEEE 1394 (Firewire), etc., can be used.  Wireless 

communication links, such as defined by 802.11b, etc., can be employed.  By using multiple 

systems, users in different geographic locations can cooperate, compete, or otherwise 

interact with each other through generated images.  Images generated by two or more 

systems can be “tiled” together, or otherwise combined to produce conglomerate displays. 

Other types of illumination, as opposed to light, can be used.  For example, radar signals, 

microwave or other electromagnetic waves can be used to advantage in situations where an 

object to detect (e.g., a metal object) is highly reflective of such waves.  It is possible to 

adapt aspects of the system to other forms of detection, such as by using acoustic waves in 

air or water. 

Although computer systems have been described to receive and process the object image 

signals and to generate display signals, any other type of processing system can be used.  

For example, a processing system that does not use a general-purpose computer can be

employed.  Processing systems using designs based on custom or semi-custom circuitry or 

chips, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays 

(FPGAs), multiprocessor, asynchronous or any type of architecture design or methodology 

can be suitable for use with the present invention. 

To illustrate, if the user placed a business card on her desk, for instance, the device would 

recognize the business card and present the user with options germane to the contact 

information contained in the business card such as save, email, call, schedule a meeting or 

set a reminder.  Save would use text recognition to create a new contact in the appropriate 

software containing the information from the business card.  In another embodiment, the 

device may also recognize when multiple similar documents are present—for example, ten 

business cards—and present options to perform batch functions on the set of similar 

documents, for example, save all. 

In one embodiment, the device presents options by projecting menu items in proximity to 

the recognized object as shown in Fig. 5.  The device recognizes documents in real time, 

such that moving a document will cause the associated menu items to move with it.  The 

device also tracks and distinguishes multiple documents.  As shown in Fig. 5, the projected 

pairs of brackets A and B correspond to distinct documents, each of which has its own 

associated menu of options.   

To perform a function, the user touches a menu item.  The device recognizes when the 

user's hand engages with a menu item and performs the function associated with the 

selected menu item.  A possible function includes uploading an image of the document or 

object to Dropbox.  When the user touches the “Dropbox” button, as seen in Fig. 5, the 

device will take a image of the document or object and upload that image to the user’s 

Dropbox account.  It will be understood that Dropbox is only an example of the many 

available services for storing, transmitting, or sharing digital files, which also include Box, 

Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Amazon Cloud Services, for example.   

In one embodiment, the invention can recognize text and highlight words on a physical 

document.  For example, a user reading a lease may want to review each instance of the 

term landlord.  The device would find each time the term “landlord” occurs on the page and 

highlight each instance using the projector.  In another exemplary embodiment, the device 

would have access to a digital version of the document and would display page numbers of 

other instances of the search term—for example, “landlord”—in proximity to the hard copy 

document for ease of reference by the user.  In yet another embodiment, the device could 



Page 76 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

display an alternate version of the document in proximity to the hard copy version for the 

user to reference while also highlighting changes in the hard copy document, the digital 

version, or both.   

The device may also recognize markings by the user on a hard copy document and interpret 

those markings to make changes in the digital version of the document.  Such markings 

could include symbols common in text editing, symbols programmed by the user, or 

symbols created for the particular program the user is interacting with.  For example, a 

graphic designer may use certain symbols to be translated into preselected design elements 

for a digital rendering.    

Another exemplary function is sharing.  When the user touches the “Share” button, the 

device will take an image or video of the document or object and share the image or video 

via a selected service by, for example, attaching the image to an email or other message 

service, or posting the image to Facebook, Twitter, a blog, or other social media service.  

The device may also incorporate sharing features without the use of third-party services. 

In another embodiment, the invention can provide an interactive workspace between two or 

more users, allowing them to collaborate on the same document by representing the input 

from one user on other workspaces.  This functionality can allow for interactive 

presentations, teaching, design, or development.  For example, a student practicing 

handwriting could follow a tutor’s guide as pen strokes are transmitted in real time between 

the two devices.  Or two artists could sketch on a shared document simultaneously.  

Throughout the process, the device could maintain a digital record of the users’ interactions, 

maintaining a version history for users to view changes over time or revert to previous 

versions. 

In another embodiment, the device may broadcast live video of a document or workspace.  

For example, the device would present broadcast or stream as a standalone menu option or 

as a secondary option under the Share menu item.  The device would then capture live 

video of the document or workspace area.  The device would also provide options for 

distributing a link, invitation, or other means for other parties to join and/or view the live 

stream.   

To illustrate further, an accountant may wish to remotely review tax documents with a 

client.  The accountant would initiate the live stream by selecting the appropriate menu 

option.  The device would recognize the associated document and broadcast a video of that 

document.  If the accountant wanted to review multiple documents, she could select the 



Page 77 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

appropriate sharing or streaming option for each relevant document.  The device could 

present options to stream various documents or objects simultaneously or alternately as 

selected by the user.   

In another embodiment, the accountant could “share” or “stream” a portion of her 

workspace distinct from any individual document or object, but that could include multiple 

documents or objects.  In this case, the user may select “share” or “stream” from a default 

menu not associated with a particular document.  The device would then project a boundary 

to show the user the area of the workspace captured by the camera for sharing or 

streaming purposes.  The user could adjust the capture area by touching and dragging the 

projected boundary.  The user could also lock the capture area to prevent accidentally 

adjusting the boundary.  To illustrate, a user may be a chef wanting to demonstrate 

preparing a meal.  The device may recognize a cutting board and provide an option to share 

or stream the cutting board, but the chef may need to demonstrate preparation techniques 

outside of the cutting board area.  The chef could select the share or stream option from the 

workspace menu and adjust the capture area to incorporate all necessary portions of the 

workspace.  That way, the chef could demonstrate both knife skills for preparing vegetables 

and techniques for rolling pasta dough in the same capture frame. 

The user may also transition from document sharing or stream to workspace sharing or 

streaming by adjusting the capture boundary during capture when the capture boundary is 

not locked. 

In one embodiment, the device may recognize that two documents or objects are 

substantially similar and offer a compare option as a menu item.  If the user selected 

“compare,” the device would use text recognition to scan the documents and then highlight 

differences between the two.  Highlighting would be portrayed by the projector.  

Alternatively, the device may compare a physical document and a digital version of a 

substantially similar document.  The device would then display differences either on the 

physical documents as described above or on the digital document or both.  The device 

could display the digital document by projecting an image of the document onto a surface in 

the workspace or through a smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, touchscreen monitor, or 

other similar apparatus linked to the device. 

In one embodiment, the device may check documents for spelling errors and highlight them 

on either a physical or digital version of the document.  The device may also recognize 

citations or internet links in physical documents and present the referenced material 



Page 78 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

through the projector or other display means previously mentioned.  For example, a 

business card may contain a link to a person’s social media accounts (e.g., LinkedIn).  In 

processing the information contained in the business card, for example, the device could 

incorporate other contact information from online sources, or provide an option to connect 

with the person via social media accounts.   

In one embodiment, the device may recognize an object and provide an option to search a 

database or the Internet for that object and information related to that object.  For 

example, the device may identify a book by various features including title, author, year of 

publication, edition, or international standard book number (ISBN).  With that information, 

the device could search the internet for the book to allow the user to purchase the book, 

read reviews of the book, see an article citing the book, or view works related to the book.  

For example, if the user was viewing a cookbook, the device could create a shopping list for 

the user based on ingredients listed in the recipe.  The device could also create and transmit 

an order to a retailer so that the desired ingredients could be delivered to the user or 

assembled by the retailer for pickup.   

In another embodiment, the device may recognize objects like food items.  Many food items 

have barcodes or other distinguishing characteristics that could be used for identification.  

Deployed in the kitchen, the device could track a user’s grocery purchases to maintain a list 

of available food.  This feature may be accomplished by using the device to scan grocery 

store receipts.  This feature may also be accomplished by using the device of recognizing 

various food items as they are unpacked from grocery bags and place in storage.  The 

device could then also recognize food items as they are used to prepare meals, removing 

those items from a database of available foods.  The device may also access information on 

freshness and spoilage to remind a user to consume certain foodstuffs before they go bad.  

The device may display recipes based on available food items and other parameters desired 

by the user.  While the user is cooking, the device may provide instructions or other 

information to assist the user.  The device may also create grocery lists for the user based 

on available food stuff and past purchasing behaviors.  The device may also order certain 

food items for delivery at the user's request.    

The device may also be employed to improve workspace ergonomics and enabled richer 

interaction with digital objects.  For example, when the device is displaying a traditional 

computer interface like in Fig. 4, the device may adjust the projected image to create an 

optimal viewing experience for the user.  This could be accomplished in part by applying 

eye-tracking methods, which are known in the art.  Projection adjustments could include 



Page 79 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

basic modifications like increasing or decreasing text size based on the user’s proximity to 

the projected image.  More complex modifications could include changing the perspective of 

the projected image based on the user’s viewing angle and the orientation of the projector 

and projection surface.  Projected images may also be adjusted for other workspace 

characteristics like the brightness of the surrounding area, the reflectivity of the projection 

surface, or the color of the projection surface—for example, factors which affect the 

viewability of the projected image.  Advanced image manipulation could give the user the 

impression of one or more 3D objects. 

In one embodiment, the device may recognize design schematics of a building, for example, 

either in hard copy or in a digital format using computer-aided design software known in the 

art.  The device may then represent the design and/or building model in 2D and/or 3D 

format across the workspace using the projector or other display technologies previously 

enumerated.   

In another embodiment, processing can be divided between local and remote computing 

devices.  For example, a server may construct a high-resolution dense 3D model while user 

interactions are transmitted over a communication network to manipulate the model.  

Changes to the model are calculated by the service and returned to the user device.  

Concurrently with this, a low-resolution version of the model is constructed locally at the 

user device, using less processing power and memory, which is used to render a real-time 

view of the model for viewing by the user.  This enables the user to get visual feedback 

from the model construction from a local processor, avoiding network latency issues. 

In another embodiment, the device could recognize a user’s interaction with one or more 

perceived 2D or 3D objects.  The projector or other display technology previously 

enumerated, could create an image of a 3D building for one or more users, for example.  A 

user could manipulate the digital object by interacting with the borders of the perceived 

object.  The device would recognize when the user’s hands, for example, intersect with the 

perceived edge of a digital object and adjust the image according to the user’s interaction.  

The user may, for example, enlarge the building model by interacting with the model at two 

points and then dragging those two points farther away from each other.  Other interactions 

could modify the underlying digital object—for example, making the model building taller or 

shorter. 

In one embodiment, the device may track different documents that are referenced by the 

user at the same time.  For example, if an accountant reviews a client’s tax documents, the 



Page 80 of 85 
 
 

 

 

 

www.lampix.co © Lampix | New York / San Francisco 

device would recognize that the document could be related because of their physical and 

temporal proximity in the user’s workspace.  The device could then associate those 

documents using metadata, tags, or categories.  Other indicia of relatedness may also be 

employed by the device’s recognition function—for example, the appearance of similar 

names or terms.  The user may also indicate other types of relatedness depending on the 

nature of the object.   

In one embodiment, the device may employ its recognition function to track the physical 

location of documents or other objects to help users later find those objects.  For example, 

an accountant may reference a binder containing a client’s tax documentation including a 

W-2 form from a prior year.  The device may track characteristics of the document and the 

binder containing the document as the user places the binder on a bookshelf in the 

workspace.  Later, the accountant may want to reference the document again and could 

query the device to show the location of the document by interacting with projected menu 

options or another input device previously enumerated.  The device could then highlight the 

appropriate binder using the projector.  The device may also track frequently referenced 

documents to suggest optimized digital and physical organization schemes based on 

reference frequency and/or other characteristics. 

The invention will also allow for interaction by voice command, separate or in conjunction 

with other input modes.  The invention will also allow for the implementation of additional 

functionality by developers and users. 

The invention has another distinct advantage over computers:  it will also function as a 

working lamp.  As shown in Fig. 6, the lamp may be controlled through the default menu 

items, which include “Up” and “Down” to adjust the brightness of the lamp. 

In one embodiment, the device has one or more visual sensors, one or more projectors, one 

or more audio sensors, a processor, a data storage component, a power supply, a light 

source, and a light source controller.  One possible configuration of the device is shown in 

Figs.  1-3.   

These interactive display systems can incorporate additional inputs and outputs, including, 

but not limited to, microphones, touchscreens, keyboards, mice, radio frequency 

identification (RFID) tags, pressure pads, cellular telephone signals, personal digital 

assistants (PDAs), and speakers.

These interactive display systems can be tiled together to create a single larger screen or 

interactive area.  Tiled or physically separate screens can also be networked together, 

allowing actions on one screen to affect the image on another screen. 

In an exemplary implementation, the present invention is implemented using a combination 

of hardware and software in the form of control logic, in either an integrated or a modular 

manner.  Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill 

in the art will know of other ways and/or methods to implement the present invention. 

It will be appreciated that the embodiments described above are cited by way of example, 

that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described 

hereinabove, and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to 

persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this 

application and scope of the appended claims.  All publications, patents, and patent 

applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes in their 

entirety.  The scope of the present invention includes both combinations and sub-

combinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and 

modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the 

foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art.

Legal disclaimer 

Company has prepared a white paper and other materials concerning the sale of [PIX] 
Tokens and the Project, which are available at https://lampix.co/token.html (the “White 
Paper”).  The White Paper, as it may be amended from time to time, is hereby incorporated 
by reference. 

The [PIX] Tokens will be distributed to buyers thereof pursuant to the [PIX] Distribution 
Contract.  Company makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, including, 
without limitation, any warranties of title or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness 
for a particular purpose with respect to the [PIX] Distribution Contract or the [PIX] Tokens 
or their utility, or the ability of anyone to purchase or use the [PIX] Tokens.  Without 
limiting the foregoing, none of the Company Parties represent or warrant that the process of 
purchasing and/or receiving the [PIX] Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free or that the 
[PIX] Tokens are reliable and error-free.  As a result, Buyer acknowledges and understands 
that Buyer may never receive [PIX] Tokens and may lose the entire amount Buyer paid to 
Company.  Buyer shall provide an accurate digital wallet address to Company for receipt of 
any [PIX] Tokens distributed to Buyer pursuant to the [PIX] Distribution Contract. 

The sale of [PIX] Tokens and the [PIX] Tokens themselves are not securities, commodities, 
swaps on either securities or commodities, or a financial instrument of any kind.  Purchases 
and sales of [PIX] Tokens are not subject to the protections of any laws governing those 
types of financial instruments.  This Agreement and all other documents referred to in this 
Agreement including the White Paper do not constitute a prospectus or offering document, 
and are not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy an investment, a security, 
commodity, or a swap on either a security or commodity. 

Buyer should not participate in the [PIX] Token Distribution or purchase [PIX] Tokens for 
investment purposes.  [PIX] Tokens are not designed for investment purposes and should 
not be considered as a type of investment.  Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees 
that Buyer should not expect and there is no guarantee or representation or warranty by 
Company that:  (a) the Project will ever be adopted; (b) the Project will be adopted as 
developed by Company and not in a different or modified form; (c) a blockchain utilizing or 
adopting the Project will ever be launched; and (d) a blockchain will ever be launched with 
or without changes to the Project. 

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is not purchasing [PIX] Tokens for purposes of 
investment, speculation, as some type of arbitrage strategy, for immediate resale or other 
financial purposes. 

The Project is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time.  
Although Company intends for the Project to have the features and specifications set forth 
in the White Paper, Company may make changes to such features and specifications for any 
number of reasons, any of which may mean that the [PIX] Platform does not meet Buyer’s 
expectations.

Buyer acknowledges and understands that the proceeds from the sale of the [PIX] Tokens 
will be utilized by Company in its sole discretion. The proceeds may as well be used for a 
secondary share buy back by the company at its unique discretion. 

RISKS 

On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so 
block production can occur at random times.  For example, ETH contributed to the [PIX] 
Distribution Contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for 
that period.  Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not 
include the Buyer’s transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive [PIX] 
Tokens the same day Buyer sends ETH. 

The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be 
delayed or lost.  Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an 
attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens.  Buyer acknowledges and 
understands that Ethereum block producers may not include Buyer’s transaction when 
Buyer wants or Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all. 

[PIX] Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft.  Hackers or other malicious 
groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the [PIX] Distribution Contract or the 
[PIX] Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of 
service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  
Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and [PIX] 
Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts 
may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect 
the [PIX] Tokens or result in the loss of Buyer’s [PIX] Tokens, the loss of Buyer’s ability to 
access or control Buyer’s [PIX] Tokens or the loss of ETH in Buyer’s account.  In the event 
of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of [PIX] Tokens 
are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation. 

The Project and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested.  The 
Project might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption.  It is possible that 
no blockchain utilizing the Project will ever be launched and there may never be an 
operational platform.  Even if the Project is completed, implemented and adopted, it might 
not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the Project 
may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable.  Also, technology is changing 
rapidly, so the [PIX] Tokens and the Project may become outdated. 

The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is 
unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.  It is difficult to predict how or whether 
governmental authorities will regulate such technologies.  It is likewise difficult to predict 
how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, 
regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain 
technology and its applications.  Such changes could negatively impact [PIX] Tokens in 
various ways, including, for example, through a determination that [PIX] Tokens are 
regulated financial instruments that require registration.  Company may cease the 
distribution of [PIX] Tokens, the development of the Project or cease operations in a 
jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially 
undesirable to continue to do so.

The industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened 
oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions.  There can be no 
assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Company and/or 
pursue enforcement actions against Company.  Such governmental activities may or may 
not be the result of targeting Company in particular.  All of this may subject Company to 
judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations 
and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm 
Company’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material 
adverse effect on the [PIX] Tokens and/or the development of the Project.
