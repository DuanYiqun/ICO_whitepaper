1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1.1 Overview 
 

From the same company that developed the only retail energy franchise in the European Union: 

“The first crypto token that enables users to Send and Receive Energy Worldwide” 

 

Restart Energy, an independent European Union electricity and gas supply company with USD 20 million in 

current annual revenue that developed the first energy retail franchise is building a global decentralized and 

delocalized electrical energy supply platform and ecosystem.  

Restart Energy is the fastest growing private energy and gas provider operating in an EU country (Romania), 

offering an innovative online and customer-centric service with greater transparency. The current customer 

base (December 2017) of Restart Energy includes over 3,000 SMEs and multinational companies for energy, 

gas and fuel packages; and over 27,000 household customers for energy and gas. Restart Energy is the first 

energy supplier in Europe to accept energy invoice payments in Bitcoin (September 2017). 

 

Company key numbers 
 Revenues in 2016: 5,45 million USD (>400% growth from 2015) 

 Revenues estimated for 2017: 20 million USD (+425%) and revenue forecast for 2018 is 100 million 

USD (+500%) 

 30,000 customers (27,000 households + 3,000 companies) 

 40,000 payment locations in Romania 

 +300 energy franchises sold to business partners in Romania

Restart Energy is building a global energy supply platform using blockchain protocol to democratize a sector 

burdened by bureaucracy and transaction costs, freeing up capital, saving consumers money, helping local 

small producers earn more and allowing real peer to peer direct energy trading using existing infrastructure.  

 

Energy demand globally is expected to nearly double by 2030.  With finite resources and the commitment to 

the UN SDGs, nations must innovate to generate power in a socially, economically, and environmentally 

sustainable manner. The European Union Member States and the United States have begun piloting reforms 

through energy market deregulation, allowing private companies to operate in the power retail sector. 

Countries across Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore have 

opted for market deregulation in a bid to create sustainability while China and India are slated to follow from 

2018.

Our vision 
We envision a vibrant, sustainable world where affordable energy is created and consumed by anyone 

anywhere. 

 

 

Our mission 
Our mission is to become the leading global energy supplier, innovating and democratizing the sector. 

 

 

Our goals 
Restart Energy is committed to achieving the following goals: 

 Raise 30 million USD, in order to finish RED development and expand globally 

 Expand energy retail business by franchising to +45 countries with deregulated markets, representing 

70 percent of the world’s energy consumption through 2022 

 

 

Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P) 
RED-P is a software for a global decentralized energy supply. 

Consumers and producers register to use the RED-P to gain access to 1) global energy supply, 2) intelligent 

wifi meters, 3) watt prediction software and 4) peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange 5) Users earn green 

certificates. 

     

Innovative features of RED-P include:  
 Any registered user can buy or sell from any other registered user 

 Some consumers are also generators (e.g. wind/solar) as large power stations (gas, coal, nuclear) are 

being replaced with thousands of consumer-generators. 

 P2P: All parties in our ecosystem are able to trade with each other. 

 Consumers will be awarded with Restart Energy standard green certificates for using renewable 

energy. 

With the new platform, we anticipate energy companies to adapt to the new economy. Energy companies will 

start to take payment of energy bills in tokens as there will be a market for those tokens.  

         

Finally, RED-P will increase competition in the electricity market. For instance, with our model, consumers will 

be able to “auto-switch” their energy supplier every 30 days. The system will tender consumer contracts every 

30 days seamlessly, ensuring a more competitive marketplace and truly market-reflective prices. 

 

 

RED MegaWatt Token’s Utility (MWAT) 
 

The RED MegaWatt (MWAT) Tokens are ERC20 utility tokens that give access to the RED Platform Software 

and to the RED Franchise. The RED Platform is a blockchain based decentralized energy trading platform that 

makes it possible for energy consumers and producers to Send and Receive Energy Worldwide. The tokenized 

energy traded on the RED Platform can be physically delivered at local rates in countries with deregulated 

energy markets where Restart Energy will be present directly or through franchise. The RED Franchise is the 

first power retail franchise that makes it simple and easy to start and operate your own power utility company. 

The RED MegaWatt Tokens are the first tokens backed by real opportunity. Each RED MegaWatt Token gives 

access to trade up to 1 MWh of energy per month on the RED Platform Software. Restart Energy will allocate 

an initial charge of 0.11 KW Tokens per RED MegaWatt Token. The RED MegaWatt Token is similar to a 

“virtual energy battery”.

1.2 Restart Energy Franchise (RED–F) 
 

Restart Energy developed the first franchise in the European Union energy industry that easily allows any 

person to have its own power retail business and earn revenues by selling energy & gas to retail consumers. 

 

 

Owning RED MegaWatt Tokens grants the holder’s access to the RED Franchises and to incomes from selling 

energy contracts as follows: 

 

 

10.000 Tokens - RED City Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in their 
city of residence 

100.000 Tokens - RED Regional Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in 
an entire region of their country of residence 

1.000.000 Tokens - Red Country Franchise - allows the token holder to broker energy sales in 
their entire country of residence 

+10.000.000 Tokens - RED Master Franchise - gives the token holder country exclusivity and the 

option to create sub-franchises inside their country of residence (starting from 10,000,000 Tokens up, 

dependent on population)

Would you buy a McDonald’s franchise now if you had the chance? 

Introducing the RED Franchise 
 
Be the first to secure your retail energy franchise in your country and resell it to other private suppliers or 
companies after the Token Generation Event (TGE). 
As we move forward, and as we have already successfully done in the past, we will focus our efforts on 

growing our franchise network - this time on a global scale. Every franchise needs to own a certain number of 
MWAT tokens to operate 

 
If you’re interested in entering the energy sector, then Restart Energy’s franchise program is a unique 

opportunity to become personally involved in our mission to re-invent the way energy is bought, sold, and 

traded globally – through the RED ecosystem – a global, privatized, decentralized energy supply platform.  

 
 

What is the RED Franchise? 
  
The RED Franchise (RED-F) is an exclusive business opportunity available to MWAT Token holders. It is an 
innovative, tested, and working idea that is already being used within the European Union. By allowing MWAT 
token holders to create and run their own energy retail business, we are merging decentralization blockchain 

technology with free market principles. 

 
 

RED Franchise Types & Tiers 
 
There are two proposed franchise models to work with the RED ecosystem. 
 
 
 



 

12 
 

Type A - Franchise Owner of a Power Retail Company 
In a Type A franchise, Restart Energy would work together with the Master-Franchisee to help set-up his own 
power retail company, and the Master-Franchisee would be the one to enter into a new market and establish 

his business. The Master-Franchisee would take on all risk and expenses to create a market, and Restart 
Energy would provide technical, infrastructural, process automation, marketing and sales support. The Master-

Franchisee would need to provide the financial and management capacity for setting up a power retail 

company. 
Master Franchise owner would receive a full power retail business in a shell: 
Assistance for creation & operation of own power retail company 
Right to use Restart Energy’s brand and business model including software and franchise infrastructure 
Control over revenues 
Technical Training for all staff and employees 
Marketing and Branding package 
Country Promotion for the months leading up to and after launch, paid for by Restart Energy, in order to 
promote the RED ecosystem and franchise business 
Access to Complete Energy Supply CRM Software with 100% process automation 
Access to Restart Energy specialized personnel and management to assist and fully support the 

franchise and its owners 
Energy & gas trading, balancing and forecasting technical support 
 
Pros: Higher profits ; ownership of power retail company ; cross selling to existing customer database ; high 
process automation to deal with large numbers of low volume consumers with high margins ; unique selling 

points and ecosystem ; flexible products and services 
Cons: Higher capital requirements ; Franchisee takes the risk of expansion to new markets 
 
Type B – Reselling / Brokering 
Restart Energy would be the one to enter into a new market and establish the company. The company would 

take on all risks and expenses to create a market, and the franchise owner would simply act as a retailer or 

broker with our full support. 
 
Master Franchise owner would receive: 
Right to create and sell sub-franchises 
Part of revenues from all sub-franchises 
A comprehensive franchise kit, detailing all relevant information for the target market, modelled after our 
already successful franchise kits provided to European partners. 
Training for all staff and employees 
Marketing and Branding 
Local Promotion for the months leading up to and after the launch, paid for by Restart Energy to promote 

the RED ecosystem and franchise business 
Access to the Agent Module, offering the ability to add new franchises, see energy consumption and 

manage clients 
Access to the Front Desk Module of RED CRM 
Access to Restart Energy management, from where we can assist and fully support the franchise and its 
owners 
As a reseller/broker, you would be entitled to a percentage of all revenues made by all other franchises in the 

target country (typically 10%), plus the revenues generated from direct sales, in the form of signing 
premium plus passive consumption commission. 
 
Pros: Very low risk, Restart Energy takes on cost of expansion 
Cons: Lower margin compared to full franchise ownership 
 
 
 



 

13 
 

 
 
RED Franchise Tiers 
Owning a certain number of RED MWAT tokens grants holders free access to one of four RED Franchise tiers 

and to the income from selling those energy contracts. It is important to note that it is only required that a 
franchise owner holds a certain amount of tokens. It is not a form of payment to Restart Energy. 
 
Type A - Master Franchise Token Tiers/Country: 
Please check exhibit A for country minimum token tiers. Besides holding a minimum amount of MWAT tokens, 

Type A - Franchise owners have to meet Restart Energy minimum capital requirements and pass business 
conduct and reputation due diligence. 
 

Type B - Franchise Token Tiers :  
10,000 Tokens - RED City Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in their city of residence 
100,000 Tokens - RED Regional Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in an entire region of 

their country of residence 
1,000,000 Tokens - Red Country Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in their entire country of 
residence 
10,000,000+ Tokens - RED Master Franchise - gives the token holder exclusive rights in his/her country 
of resident and the option to create sub-franchises inside that country.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Existing Franchise Partners 
 
As mentioned above, Restart Energy is already using the Franchise model proposed in our Whitepaper. A big 
part of the company’s success to date has been based on its ability to successfully develop a multi-channel 
sales strategy, by quickly identifying market opportunities and leveraging local resources, such as micro-

entrepreneurs, through the first retail energy franchise in the European Union. 
  

Current non-blockchain model 
  
The success of a franchise owner is our success as well. We work hard to ensure all franchises are fully 

supported via multiple sales channels for energy retail. As an example, in Romania, we are leveraging multiple 
sales channels for the supply of energy and gas with the following efforts: 
1. Local distribution partners who acquire a franchise and sell energy to their longstanding customers. This 

strategy has proven very successful so far and will be a major contribution to our global expansion plans. 
2. Formation of local D2D teams around our best local franchise partners.( +200 D2D agents employed by 

franchisee’s) 
3. Our own sales force that currently includes: 1 National Sales Manager, 1 Logistics Manager, 8-person 

Contracting Department, 7 Regional Sales Managers, 70 D2D sales agents (commission-based). 
4. Partnerships with national companies like EuroGSM (largest ORANGE telecom dealer), InterBroker (3rd 
largest insurance broker), GRS (largest auto insurance broker), Lyoness (largest cash-back shopping network), 

Romanian Post (5000+ country locations), TVSat (largest regional media & telecom company), Romanian War 
Veterans Organization, etc.

We envision a vibrant, sustainable world where affordable energy is created and consumed by anyone 

anywhere. 

 

 

 

 

2.5 Our mission 

Our mission is to become the leading global energy supplier, innovating and democratizing the sector. 

 

 

 

 

2.6 Our goals

31 
 

3  THE CHALLENGE 

 

Despite the deregulation of energy markets, several challenges prevent market entry for private electricity 

suppliers.  With legacy players continuing to hold majority share of the market, little has changed since the 

deregulation.   

 

Obstacles to entering the household and SME energy markets include capital-intensive infrastructure and 

process automations necessary to handle large numbers of low volume consumption. Current service models 

do not provide direct connection between producers of renewable energy to consumers, resulting in the 

inability to profit and grow business, save, and choose between renewable and fossil fuels. Government 

subsidies for renewable energy are designed to jumpstart markets until the necessary economies of scale for 

grid parity are reached, but in reality, there are very few countries where renewable energy has reached grid 

parity.  

 

Now, after the drop in subsidies, the world is looking for a new distributed energy development model to 

directly connect end users to producers to allow consumers direct access to accountable, cheaper energy and 

to provide producers with increased ROI, enabling a faster renewable energy deployment around the world. 

Small consumers and producers are usually trapped in contracts with suppliers that provide limited services at 

high costs for the end users. Currently, the limited blockchain energy schemes have focused on incentivizing 

renewable energy generation. This model does not solve the main issues in the market raised above. 

 

 

3.1 Our Solution 

Restart Energy Democracy (RED): The first global online energy provider. 

Restart Energy is developing a blockchain-based platform with a single, intuitive user interface allowing for 

global energy supply that will help it become the next generation utility company. 

More than 3 billion energy consumers all over the world in deregulating markets will be able to switch their 

current energy provider with Restart Energy or a RED Franchise in an online, transparent environment using 

our platform in less than 5 minutes. The platform will provide for all of their energy needs in a superior user-

friendly way for real time consumption, invoices, payments and, most importantly, it will allow for direct peer 

to peer energy associated rights exchanged between consumers, prosumers and producers of any kind. 

The Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED) connects energy producers and traders with retail customers 

around the globe in a transparent, decentralized manner; creating added value for all the parties by employing 

blockchain to remove several layers of costs associated with bureaucracy and transaction costs.   

By rearranging the way transactions are settled in a transparent manner using blockchain, producers will be 

able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher compared to the wholesale price to high numbers of low-

volume retail customers, who will then pay 30% less using existing grid infrastructure and the RED platform 

administered by Restart Energy. 

Furthermore, we intend to develop a new standard of cryptographic green certificates on Blockchain that will 

be awarded to consumers of renewable energy. The green certificates will store information about the source 

of energy, the producer, the consumer/user and the owner of the certificates. We believe that by creating a 

transparent and accountable standard of cryptographic green certificates that can be traded on secondary 

markets we add incentives to consumers for consuming renewable energy and ultimately increasing the 

revenues of the producers.

Fig. 5 Current market roles 

 
 

3.2 How Electricity Is Traded Now 

At present, electricity is traded through exchanges or over-the-counter transactions (OTC). In many markets, 

more than 75% of the electricity volume is traded over the counter. As a result, bids and offers are managed 

by financial brokers, and therefore, are often executed outside of exchanges. This, in turn, reduces the 

visibility and transparency of the transactions. In addition, the centralized model of trading with a small 

number of large-scale energy companies dominating the market further limits improvements toward visibility 

and transparency of trades. 

The global trends and latest technologies in renewable energy generation has enabled individual consumers to 

generate energy on their own and this has pushed the energy markets toward decentralization. In addition, 

improvements in the battery technologies have enabled efficient storage of energy, providing more 

opportunities for consumers to become independent in their energy management.  

However, the current transaction model remains a barrier to trade: consumers must still use the traditional 

methods to purchase and sell their excess energy requirements from their own generation. 

 

 

 

 

 



 

33 
 

3.3 Current System 

1) Consumer: takes energy from the grid; pays retail price for energy; usually cannot choose his energy 

source; low accountability; low incentive to invest in renewable energy.  

2) Prosumer: a consumer that also produces energy; a prosumer produces more energy with solar than 

needed, so sells some back to the grid at a very low price - low because these small quantities are 

very difficult to forecast, and legacy energy providers have no incentives to offer such services 

because their own supply and revenue from consumers would be reduced.  

 

Producer: injects energy into the grid; gets wholesale price for the energy; very low return on investment 

means low incentive to invest without subsidies.  

 

3.4 New System: Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P)  

RED-P is a global, decentralized energy supply platform.  

Consumers and producers register to use the RED-P to gain access to 1) global energy supply, 2) intelligent 

wifi meters, 3) watt prediction software and 4) peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange. 5) Earn green 

certificates. 

 

Innovative features of RED-P include:  

 Any registered user can buy or sell from any other registered user 

 Some consumers are also generators (e.g. wind/solar) as large power stations (gas, coal, nuclear) are 

being replaced with thousands of consumer-generators. 

 P2P: All parties in our ecosystem are able to trade with each other. 

 

With the new platform, we anticipate energy companies to adapt to the new economy. Energy companies will 

start to take payment of energy bills in tokens as there will be a market for those tokens and a value 

associated with them. Blockchain is appealing to energy companies as it will allow the energy companies to 

address the administrative burden of connecting to retail market consumers, energy producers, balancing 

responsible parties and other bodies through the blockchain. It would also automate payments daily or weekly, 

with lower levels of debt. 

 

Finally, RED-P will increase competition in the electricity market. For instance, with our model, consumers will 

be able to “auto-switch” their energy supplier every 30 days. The system will tender consumer contracts every 

30 days seamlessly, ensuring a more competitive marketplace and truly market-reflective prices. 

 

RED MWAT token holders purchasing energy from the RED platform will also receive 1 Green Certificate for 

each 1 MWh of green energy consumed. The green certificates will be automatically allocated to the 

Consumers' accounts and will help in accounting for how much green energy they have consumed. A 

secondary platform for green certificates will be developed on the RED platform where companies that want to 

support renewable energy production and help the planet end fossil fuel pollution may purchase the green 

certificates from the consumers according to free-market principles. 

The companies will be able to use the purchased green certificates globally to reduce their carbon footprint 

and prove their green credentials in a transparent manner. 

Each green certificate on blockchain will contain information of the production source, issue date and will allow 

the general public to track ownership.

These green certificates represent an additional income source for the owners and incentivize the Consumers 

to use the RED platform for purchasing green energy. 

By deploying the green certificates into the RED Ecosystem we are increasing the added value and margin 

gains of the renewable energy producers that will access the RED Platform. 

 

3.5 Size of the market  

By 2016, the worldwide electricity consumption reached 21,190 TWh (Terawatt hours). Asia and Americas 

accounted for 43% and 27% of the total respectively.  Of the Asian consumption, China accounted for 58% 

while India accounted for 12%. In other words, China has consumed approximately 25% of the world’s 

electricity in 2016. 

The global power market is currently worth around US$ 2 trillion per annum. The extent of deregulation of 

energy trading largely varies according to the country/territory. 

Majority of the world’s largest energy markets are already deregulated and some others are moving towards 

deregulation. However, most of the Middle East and Africa markets remain highly regulated, which account for 

around 8% of the global consumption. 

 

Further, it is important to note that China has recently announced1 its plan of deregulation of electricity market 

that is currently worth US$ 500 billion.  

 

3.6 Energy Markets Regulations 

 35 countries in the world accounting for 44 percent of the world’s energy consumption have already 

embraced deregulated energy markets and many other markets will follow 

 Japan recently deregulated its energy market because power became substantially more expensive 

after Fukushima and citizens no longer trusted the energy monopolies, making the idea of open 

markets more appealing 

 India is experimenting with deregulated energy markets 

 China is planning to open its US$ 500 billion energy market  

A deregulated electricity market would generally allow the market forces (demand and supply) to determine 

the price while providing opportunities for the private sector to participate in the market. Similarly, the 

European Union is also in the process of creating a unified market across its member countries/territories with 

the objective of creating an integrated energy ecosystem that will increase the efficiency of the market, 

allowing cheaper energy prices for its people in a more sustainable and manageable energy network. 

However, the extent of the deregulation can vary according to the country. At present, Western and Northern 

European markets are already deregulated to a great extent, while Southern and Eastern European markets 

are less deregulated. 

The United States usually have a highly deregulated market but not all states have separated the retail from 

the distribution operator; Canada also has deregulated markets with Alberta and Ontario being the most 

deregulated provinces. In Oceania, both Australia and New Zealand have highly deregulated markets in 

electricity with active involvement of the private sector.

35 
 

Countries across Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore have 

opted for market deregulation in a bid to create sustainability. 

 

Japan is aiming for a complete deregulation of its retail market by 2017 with reforms in electricity and gas 

markets. The Fukushima event was the main driver of the energy policy being revisited. 
Japan initiated its electricity market deregulation process last year April and it is steadily becoming one of the 

world’s largest deregulated electricity markets. If successful, the change could result in a vastly modernized 
energy sector resulting in lower rates and a more prosperous economy overall.  The deregulation could see 

Japan advance innovation and even become a model for the Asian region. 

 

Malaysia has introduced deregulation to its gas and power sector and has paved the way for the introduction 

of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to the supply function of the sector, helping the government to reduce 
the costs and administration involved in the exploration of new natural gas fields. 

 

Thailand, as a part of International Monetary Fund and World Bank recommendations, unbundled the 
Electricity Generating Authority (EGAT) assets and introduced laws for market deregulation. Since 2010, it 

offers new financial products that target huge market capitalization. 
 

The Philippines’s Energy Regulatory Commission facilitated the privatization of the National Power Corporation 
which worked very well in the urban centers, with fully liberated markets benefitting urban consumers. 

However, providing services to rural markets competitively remains a challenge. 

 
The national electricity market of Singapore, under the supervision of the Electricity Market Authority (EMA), 

facilitates the competitive sale of electricity to wholesale and retail markets. It introduced large consumers to 
the retail electricity industry with contestability reaching 45% by 2010 with a view of to eventually achieving 

100% by 2020. 

 
Pollution and overcapacity is China’s reason for market deregulation. Pollution is a major driving force behind 

China’s reform as cheap coal and overcapacity encourage wasteful consumption patterns. This stands in the 
way of the government’s efforts to improve energy efficiency and cut pollution. 

 

China’s large scale investments in wind and solar energy are being under-used within the current system, 
which is too static to effectively incorporate fluctuating green energy generation rates, resulting in waste and 

the threat of power cuts. 
The country is a big energy consumer, representing 25% of the world’s energy consumption. Electricity 

distribution and transmission are critical to China’s growing economy. 
The electricity reforms began with a pilot project in Shenzhen, in 2014, and where expanded to five more 

regions in 2015, with enterprises seeing savings of $854.6 million as result. Similarly, direct energy sales were 

expanded to seven more cities in 2015. The government is set to expand the program to ten more provincials, 
and one to two regional power grids in 2016 (including Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Guangdong), and the 

whole country by 2017. The government will be monitoring the progress of the pilot project until 2018.  
 

The regulator aims to complete the revamp of transmission and distribution tariffs by the end of this year, and 

will start trial spot market power trading by the end of 2018 and fully operate it in 2020. It also aims to 
complete work related to the opening of the retail market to new players after state-run monopolies are 

fragmented. 
 

By shifting to a deregulated market, the government wants to use market forces to phase out inefficient and 
less environmentally friendly producers out of the market. 

With the market setting prices at various bidding increments, efficient producers will now be given the chance 

to properly use their assets, under-bidding less competitive producers. As a result, China’s ageing and “dirty” 
generators will be forced to operate at peak consumption hours, thereby reducing pollution levels. 

 



 

36 
 

However, although the world is moving towards deregulation, most of the markets have not yet seen an 

efficient and effective competition as these markets are still dominated by a small number of large companies. 

In fact, this issue has been identified by most regulators who are actively encouraging the new market 

entrants and especially new technologies to transform the market and its operation, leading to a higher level 

of competition and transparency benefiting the consumers. 

3.7 The RED MegaWatt Token: Real utility from an EU energy provider 

 

Restart Energy will issue its own energy carrying cryptocurrency token called Restart Energy Democracy token 

(MWAT) in a token crowdsale of US$30MM. A real minimum raise does not exist as company’s products and 

services already are functional on the market. 

 

Each MWAT will cost the equivalent of 0.10 USD and have a virtual capacity of 1 MWh/month allocated on the 

RED Platform Software. Restart Energy will initially charge the RED MegaWatt Tokens with a minimum of 0.11 

KW/MWAT Token. The contributors may choose to consume or sell the energy rights contained in the tokens. 

The more we expand, the more energy can be traded with RED MegaWatt Tokens on the RED Platform. The 

RED MegaWatt Token works as a virtual battery2 with the ability of storing up to 1 MWh/token. This energy is 
transferred by producers and suppliers in a special community energy fund in exchange for access to the RED 

platform. The energy accumulated in the fund is distributed equally on a monthly basis amongst MWAT token 

holders accounts directly proportional to the number of tokens owned. The energy producers and suppliers will 

undertake to transfer an amount between 1% and 5% of the energy traded on the platform. By accessing a 

large retail base of customers, the energy producers will be able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher 

than the market wholesale price and at the same time, the RED platform users and consumers will purchase 

that energy at a price 30% lower than the normal market retail price. 

 

Restart Energy has agreements with energy producers currently operating 300 MW of renewable generation 

capacity to start the collaboration with RED platform and provide energy in exchange of access to the platform 

to RED MegaWatt Token holders and is in discussion with additional 2000 MW of existing renewable 

generation capacities to enter the same platform after the implementation of the RED platform.

Estimated KW Token charge 

in RED MegaWatt Tokens 0 0,11 0,86 2,74 6,24 11,24 19,13 

 

The RED MegaWatt Tokens are necessary to access the RED-Platform and can be used to access the RED 

Franchise. In addition, the tokens will be listed in the popular cryptocurrency exchanges where it can be 

traded freely. 

 

Token holders accessing the RED platform will automatically be assigned on a monthly basis a number of KW 

tokens (each KW token represents a unit of energy) directly proportional to the RED MegaWatt Tokens owned. 

The token holders’ accounts will accrue active energy each month from the Community Energy Fund 

proportional to the number of tokens owned in the form of discount received from Restart Energy as their 

energy supplier or a RED Franchise (Type A).

MegaWatt Tokens are not physical batteries. The word “battery” is used to explain how the tokens will link the energy 

distributed from the Community Energy Fund to MegaWatt Token holders’ accounts.

4  THE BACKGROUND 

 
 
“Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the 
world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most 
valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest 
accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is 
happening.” –Tom Goodwin, 2015. 
 
 
 

Restart Energy’s aim is to become the largest global energy supplier without owning the grid. 

 

 

The blockchain technology is unlocking the door to a new energy sharing economy transforming the old 

consumption patterns. Restart Energy is creating a global energy sharing ecosystem based on the blockchain 

technology.  

Presently, the services needed to provide electricity to the consumer can roughly be divided into four 

categories detailed below: generation, transmission, distribution, and retail.  

 

 

4.1 Generation 

Historically, the generation of electricity was done by governments and large scale companies; the generation 

has traditionally been hydrocarbon- or nuclear-based power plants.  

However, the generation of renewable energy is now increasing and it accounted for 3.16% of the total 

generation in 20163. 

4.2 Transmission Network Operator 

Transmission Network Operator does the business of moving electricity to long distances, generally from 

power plants (generators) to consumer networks (distributors).  

4.3 Distribution Meter Operator 

Distribution means the movement of electricity from the high voltage transmission network to the end 

consumer. Distributors normally operate lower-voltage electrical lines that connect to individual consumers or 

businesses. Where there is a power interruption, consumers need to contact their distributor who should take 

steps to resolve the issue.  

4.4 Retail Energy Company 

Retail means the sale of electricity to the end consumers. Retail companies are responsible for administering 

and billing the end consumers. In most deregulated markets, consumers might refer to the retailer as their 

“utility”. Examples include Enel, E-On, EDF, TEPCO, Seraya Energy, CEFC, Souther CO, Edison International 

etc.

4.5 Regulated and Deregulated Markets 

Electricity markets can be of two types: regulated and deregulated. 

In a regulated market, the players in the energy supply chain are able to operate as a single, vertically 

integrated monopoly.  But in deregulated markets, regulators often mandate market segmentation in such a 

way that each player in the supply chain should be operated by a separate entity.   

Deregulated markets are much more competitive than regulated markets and the prices are decided by the 

forces of demand and supply. Additionally, the marketplace is typically managed by a government-franchised 

non-profit Independent System Operator (ISO). The ISO can have additional responsibilities such as 

maintaining grid stability and reliability through market signaling, which is generally done with the help of a 

computer controlled system that is often referred to as a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 

system. 

In deregulated markets, the electricity retailers can buy electricity at wholesale prices (typically in 1MWh 

energy increments) and then sell that electricity directly to end consumers. These retailers are not directly 

responsible for powering customers; however, they are responsible for metering and billing of the 

consumption.  

In essence, consumers pay for generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. The consumers also 

need to pay their retailer’s fees. The retailer costs generally include marketing, administration, and managing 

the risk of bad debts. This retailer fees often add up to a significant amount. The difference between the 

residential and industrial prices generally arises from the costs passed to the end consumer from their retailer.  

 

4.6 Existing Retailers 

Retailers or the “utilities” are responsible for billing and interacting with customers in the end of the energy 

supply chain. Typically, an energy retailer buys the electricity in the wholesale markets, pays the distribution 

system operator a fee for distributing to the end consumer, and then bills the customer for its service at a 

markup price; this markup can be a significant percentage. 

Most of the time only about 50% of the cost of retail electricity is used to pay for the electricity purchase. 

Individual consumers are only one type of utility customer. On the other hand, industrial pricing reflects 

wholesale cost and the distribution costs. Therefore, the wholesale rate may be lower than these numbers. 

The other half is utilized in covering the administrative work, marketing, and risk of bad debts. Typically, when 

a customer signs up for a legacy utility, a credit check process is carried out to ascertain the likelihood of 

default by the customer. Most retailers are known to be slow to adopt new technology.  

Retailer can be thought be providing credit facilities for the end consumer as the retailers bill the consumer 

monthly in arrears. Retails generally deploy various risk assessment techniques to identify the potential default 

ratios and this potential loss is factored into the consumer bills. This ultimately means the regular paying 

customers are burdened with the cost of the default customers. This issue is aggravated as most regulators 

have laid down the periods (generally 3-15 days) that a retailer needs to provide the service despite the fact 

that the bills are outstanding. 

 

4.7 Challenges of renewables 

The installation of photovoltaic (PV) arrays has increased the grid’s decentralization and its ability to empower 

consumers to become producers (or “prosumers”).  

Approximately 38% of residential electricity cost is used to cover the transmission infrastructure and the losses 

during transmission.  



 

40 
 

When PV modules are installed by a customer, the generated power does not need to travel a long distance. 

For instance it can be consumer’s television within few meters away. However transmitting electricity over a 

long distance can be significantly less efficient. 

Ownership of household PV modules can be a very efficient solution and it can pay off the investment in a 

shorter period. Adoption of solar energy has in fact surpassed most optimistic estimates made a decade ago 

and it is very likely that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future. 

PV modules, although environmentally friendly, can pose new problems for the electrical grid as the power 

generated should either be stored or used immediately. Normally what happens is that the power generated is 

consumed by the household itself and any excess power generated is transferred/sold to the grid. 

Although this is a sustainable system in the long run, it can create technical challenges when they are 

deployed on a large scale. In some regions with high PV penetration, an overvoltage condition has arisen as 

more energy is transferred back into the grid than the grid can technically handle. 

The grid needs to respond by reducing the production to remove the excess energy otherwise risking damage 

to its infrastructure.  

 

4.8 Cryptocurrencies in electricity markets 

One of the most overlooked aspect of public cryptocurrencies is that of user agency. User agency refers to the 

concept that the user is in charge of his/her assets at all times, and those assets can be easily exchanged for 

other assets.  

Public cryptocurrency users secure their own funds and also authorize their own transactions.  

Public blockchains has enabled consumers to make payments using a “token-based” asset. Restart Energy 

gives an accounting layer for the energy ecosystem by making use of the Ethereum smart contracts. The users 

will retain the control of their own assets and they can choose exactly how they are to be utilized in the 

system. 

By moving the transaction logic for both energy and payments onto a blockchain-based architecture along with 

state channels, Restart Energy reduces the administrative burden of processing transactions over traditional 

payment processors that could typically charge fees of 1.5% - 2.5%. Further, by pushing market signals to 

customers, Restart Energy empowers customers to make informed decisions about their energy usage. This 

reduces their own costs; while increasing the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of the whole electrical grid.  

People want freedom: freedom of choice, freedom to breathe unpolluted air, and energy independence. 

Blockchain technology has made it possible to freely exchange goods and services from peer to peer through 

RED Platform, without the need of central systems.  

 

 

 

5  THE PROBLEM IN DETAI L 

5.1 Monopolistic players 

Legacy, vertically integrated players still hold majority shares of the deregulated energy market in the world, 

which has often created monopolistic behaviors leading to poor customer service and unreasonable and 

arbitrary pricing. With limited transparency between the producers and consumers, market inefficiencies are 

often transferred to small renewable energy producers and end customers.  

Vertical integration is a model common to many European energy markets. In theory, vertical integration 

delivers efficiencies and reduces costs to the company. The nature of electricity generation assets, which are 

expensive to build and have a long life, makes vertical integration an attractive structure for companies to help 

reduce future risks. This is because the electricity generator will always have a buyer for some or all of its 



 

41 
 

output at a price that the generator determines. This provides a high-level hedge for fluctuating relative 

profitability across the wholesale and retail sides of the electricity market. Vertically integrated companies can 

also avoid credit and collateral costs. But as well as helping manage risk, vertical integration is a business 

model that inherently lacks transparency. The different divisions or businesses – electricity generation, gas 

production, energy retail – can be sister businesses or divisions within the same company. While there will be 

separate management for each business division, these all fall within the management of a single group 

board. As a result, it is impossible to see the dynamic or relationship between the different business divisions. 

For example, to what extent is one business arm exerting pressure on the other? The dynamics between the 

different divisions will affect the price consumers pay and may differ between companies.  

 

 

In addition, monopolistic behaviors can affect the consumers negatively as follows: 

 Monopolies restrict output onto the market to exploit its dominant position over a period, or to drive 

up the price. 

 There is asymmetric information. The monopolist may know more than the consumer and it can 

exploit this knowledge to its own advantage. 

 Monopolies have no incentive to reduce average costs to a minimum. 

 Monopolies can create barriers to entry for new entrants due to high startup capital costs and 

economies of scale with their high volumes. 

 

5.2 Inefficient operating environment and trading platforms 

The nature of electricity adds complexity to the wholesale electricity market. This is because electricity is 

unlike other commodities. It is impossible to trace electricity from a particular generator to a particular 

customer and electricity is rarely stored (storage is very expensive and where it does occur tends to be in the 

form of hydro). In addition, there are very tight physical parameters, such as frequency and voltage, that must 

be maintained when it is transported via the grid system that require second by second management across 

the system. The energy trading in most countries is highly regulated, technical, and capital intensive. For 

instance, during the trading process on day-ahead markets, electricity producers who want to sell power to 

the spot market must send their sale offers (for the amount of electricity they are prepared to deliver at 

various prices during the 24 hours of the following day) to the power exchange by noon on the day before the 

power is delivered to the grid. This may lead to the reliance on erratic pricing in the energy trading by energy 

providers. 

 

Therefore, there are many problems in retail electricity and gas supply today: 

 

 The current energy-trading environment has limited the access to a few, specialized wholesale energy 

traders. On the other hand, it does not create any direct connection between energy producers and 

energy consumers, limiting the potential transparency between the parties. 

 

 Market entry for the household and SME consumer segment for private electricity suppliers is currently 

not viable because of the expensive infrastructure and process automations necessary to handle a 

large number of consumption places and the long pay-back periods behind the low volumes.  

 

 Hectic, complicated tariffs systems are confusing for the final customers.

6  DETAILS OF THE SOLUTION 

6.1 Amazon of Energy 

How will this work?  

The Restart Energy Democracy Platform connects energy producers and traders with retail customers around 

the globe in a transparent, decentralized manner that creates value for all the parties by employing a) 

blockchain to remove several layers of costs associated with bureaucracy and transactions costs and b) a 

decentralized supply service to end customers. The inherent structure of the system is designed for fast 

scalability and global applicability in all deregulated energy markets using the same proven methods that 

helped the company to achieve its fast growth in EU market. 

Producers will be able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher compared to the wholesale price due to high 

numbers of low volume retail customers that in turn will pay 30% less using existing grid infrastructure by 

rearranging the way transactions are settled in a transparent manner using blockchain. 

Energy virtually sold by producers to consumers on the RED Platform is tokenized and delivered worldwide. 

The RED Platform software automatically matches the value of internal KW Tokens depending on local energy 

rates. 

 

Energy supply as a service 

Existing private energy providers and energy producers in deregulated markets will have to purchase MWAT 

Tokens to gain access to the RED-P, and will benefit from the process automation and retail customer base 

with better margins without associated transaction capital costs and zero risks. 

Electricity and gas consumers and producers accessing RED-P will be represented by Restart Energy when 

switching energy providers, payments and other related services. At the same time, Restart Energy will sign 

contracts with local electricity and gas suppliers for providing them energy supply as a service, sales, 

marketing, IT and process automation infrastructure to supply to large numbers of low volume consumers.

6.2 Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P) 

 

The global Restart Energy Democracy platform (RED-P) software allows consumers and producers to register 

and change supplier, compare tariffs, see consumptions and pay invoices with cryptocurrency and tokens. The 

platform empowers users to buy, sell and trade energy among each other – worldwide. 

Restart Energy, provides the sales, marketing and other infrastructure including invoicing systems and process 

automation systems necessary for supplying energy to a large number of consumers to local private energy 

providers around the world while receiving a fee per unit of consumption as its revenue.  

RED-P provides transparency and improves efficiency throughout the value chain under its control. It uses 

several innovative systems and processes, including web and mobile apps, wireless metering and effortless 

online switching of suppliers with superior customer service and zero bureaucracy, enabling consumers to 

effectively acquire and manage their energy needs and achieve savings.  

Restart Energy uses the blockchain technology as the basis of this platform to apply its inherent nature of 

transparency, decentralization, and security. 

 

The model is one that works in a global context and will be implemented across all power markets, which are 

becoming increasingly deregulated. The Chinese power market, which has always been closed is also opening 

a US$500 billion market in 2020. 

Restart Energy brings the following features/benefits to its consumers, which has resulted in a far superior 

service compared to the legacy players:

Restart Energy enables its customers to pay their bills for both energy and gas through the Zebra Pay4 cash 

terminals with Bitcoin. Zebra pay provides a possibility to buy bitcoin at large network of terminals in Romania, 

where users can buy bitcoins for cash at more than 350+ physical locations. Bitcoins are transferred 

immediately at the moment of purchase. 

 

 

 

 

6.3 Decentralized energy trading platform 

Restart Energy is setting up a decentralized energy trading platform based on blockchain technology (Restart 

Energy Democracy platform or RED-P), which will enable anyone to trade energy using the tokens or fiat 

currencies in any deregulated energy market in the world. This will revolutionize the way people purchase 

their energy needs and the way energy producers sell their production.  

 

The proposed platform in its very nature will provide the following benefits: 

 
 Power to the people: everyone will be able to register, buy, sell, consume and trade the RED 

MegaWatt Tokens on the crypto-energy trading platform  

 Open an entire new market: facilitate and secure a transparent peer-to-peer exchange and contribute 

to developing cryptocurrencies as a payment instrument increasing demand 

 Restart Energy will also be able to provide delivery and offtake or purchased and sold energy

The platform will work as a global integrated energy services platform for retail energy customers, energy 

producers and suppliers. 

6.4 Virtual balancing 

Many TGE’s related to direct peer to peer energy exchange seem to lack the knowledge of how these transfers 

can be physically executed and accounted for considering that any kind of energy exchange needs to pass 

through the existing grid and requires accounting and balancing responsibility. The key to being able to 

provide direct energy exchanges between consumers and producers is closely related to the way the energy 

systems are balanced by the transport network operators (TSO).  

One of the main features of the RED-P is that it will provide virtual balancing for suppliers, consumers and 

producers in the same country (group) and assign balancing responsibility between the parties so that they 

may exchange energy among them that will be accounted in the final settlements without affecting the total 

quantities of energy inside the same balancing group. 

In other words, if Consumer A purchases energy directly from Producer B, the quantity of active energy that 

was directly purchased will not appear in the monthly supply invoice. This system is only possible if all the 

ingredients are present mainly real time energy metering and smart AI energy forecasting that can accurately 

predict intermittent energy production and consumption coming from renewable sources.

WiFi Meters provide real time energy consumption/production 

 

Restart Energy One provides its customers with the real time energy consumption viewing service on 

restartenergy.ro web site or on the mobile phone app by downloading the Restart Energy App for Android or 

IOS.  

The specially developed Restart Energy WiFi smart meters have 0.1% precision class and are installed in the 

general circuit board, without any changes to the existing meter, belonging to the distribution operator, they 

send data regarding power quality and energy consumption in real time to Restart Energy servers. You can 

see this data in real time on the phone/pc. Thus, the user knows at any moment its energy consumption and 

cost, as well as the instant active power. This is a great tool to increase public awareness about energy 

efficiency and how much electric power home appliances use. 

By monitoring and recording features related to the power quality distributed by the area distribution operator, 

namely voltage and power variations, frequency variations, harmonics, flickers, outages, Restart Energy 

servers automatically send notifications to the customer and the distribution operator whenever there are 

deviations from the Power Quality Standard. 

Customers have access to various charts and data about the historical energy consumption and the 

consumption profile.  

 

Watt Predict Solar Energy Forecast Software  

 

Watt Predict is an innovative AI learning software designed for 

superior solar energy forecasting. It is a system that is able to 

estimate electrical energy production for the next day. 

Watt Predict develops a software for a more precise estimation of 

the quantity of energy produced by photovoltaic (PV) parks. Their 

mission is reducing costs and thus significantly decreasing the 

invoices issued by institutions responsible for imbalances for 

photovoltaic systems by providing a forecasting service with high 

accuracy and financially accessibility. 

 

Watt Predict offers a new calculation method for forecasting the energy production from PV. In the forecast 

solar radiation, the most difficult component is forecasting cloudy appearance spontaneous mainframe 

systems and their evolution over time and space. To remove this drawback, it created and implemented: 

 a mathematical forecasting the appearance of clouds by detecting areas of convergence and areas of 
frontier. 

 a soft radar information from previous measurements to identify and anticipate the movement of 
cloud systems. 

Developing and combining these two components, constitutes the novelty in terms of solar radiation forecast 

by step timetable. 

 

The project received EU grants for research and is currently used in a research project in partnership with the 

European Space Agency. 

 

Our application is based on numerical weather prediction, more specifically done with open-source WRF-ARW 

regional weather prediction system initiated with GFS (Global Forecast System initial data and lateral boundary 

conditions). We use optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms in order to better represent the 

nebulosity (the main impediment in forecasting the incoming radiation). 

The energy produced by Solar PV parks is sold on energy markets 1 day in advance, thus a precise estimation 

of the quantity of energy is of supreme importance for the producers.

7  INDUSTRY ANALYSIS  

7.1 Global perspective 

By 2016, the total worldwide electricity consumption reached 21,190 TWh (Terawatt hours), with 43% of the 

consumption coming from Asia and 27% of the consumption coming from the Americas. China and India were 

responsible for most of Asia’s consumption: China at 58% and India at 12% respectively. In other words, 

China alone accounted for approximately 25% of global electricity in 2016.  

 

Global power market is worth around US$2 trillion per annum. The deregulation of this market largely depend 

on country/territory. Most of the major markets are either already deregulated or in the process of 

deregulating.  However, Middle East and Africa still remain largely regulated. But these two regions make up 

less than 8% of global electricity consumption. It is important to note that China has also recently announced 

that it would be starting the process of deregulation of its huge US$500 billion electricity market by 2018. 

 

Using power source as a metric of civilization, world energy consumption has significant implications for 

humanity's socio-economic-political sphere 5 .  The world’s primary energy supply amounted to 155,481 

terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541 Mtoe6 in 2014, while the final global energy consumption was 109,613 TWh or 

about 29.5% less than the total supply. World final energy consumption includes products such as lubricants, 

asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use 

amounted to 9,404 TWh (809 Mtoe) in 2012.

According to the 2017 Global Energy Market Trends Report8 by Schneider Electric, the global energy landscape 

is continuing to evolve. The level of complexity makes it increasingly difficult for organizations to anticipate 

and react to the variables that will have the greatest impact on their business. Within those same companies, 

these effects are likely to be felt across multiple departments across stakeholders around the world.  

 

Renewable Energy Industry Outlook9 

Throughout 2016, renewables effectively competed against fossil fuel generation in power markets and for 

procurement contracts around the world. It is clear that renewable energy resources have outgrown the 

"alternative" label. 

Due to the declining costs of solar and wind technologies as well as the anticipation of a more carbon-

constrained future, today the global growth of renewable energy is increasingly driven by voluntary 

procurement by utilities and corporations. We have seen an especially rapid decline in the global levelized cost 

of electricity (LCOE) of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation as well as onshore and offshore wind. 

 

These improving economics are empowering many customers to seek greater control over their energy 

choices, and a movement toward localized energy procurement seems to be underway. We’re seeing many 

municipalities across the world take advantage of community choice aggregation (CCA) policies, and 

community solar has taken off too. It is this strong demand from customers and communities that seem to 

have allowed renewables to shed the “alternative” label and transition into mainstream resources.

7.2 Local perspective 

Romania is the largest oil and gas producer in Central and Eastern Europe1011, but a net importer on both 

counts. According to BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy (2016)12, Romania’s proved reserves at the end of 

2015 were 100 million tons of oil (with a reserve to production ratio of 19.5) and 100 billion cubic meters 

(bcm) of gas (with a reserve to production ratio of 10.4). Domestic gas production covered in excess of 95% 

(97.61%) of total consumption in 2015.  

The main sources of electricity generation in Romania (approximate percentages valid for 20155) are as 

follows: Coal 27.63%; Hydro 27.15%; Nuclear 18.27%; Gas 14.34%; and Renewable sources (other than 

Hydro) 12.51%. Although numerous facilities have been commissioned in the last five to seven years, only 

12.51% of the total electricity generated and dispatched into the grid in 2015 was produced by energy 

facilities other than hydropower.  CEZ owns the biggest onshore wind farm from the EU in Romania, the 

Fântânele-Cogealac wind park, with a capacity of 600 MW. 

The main electricity generation companies are state-owned: Nuclearelectrica, the operator of the only nuclear 

power plant in Romania, having a capacity of 1,400 MW; Hidroelectrica’s system of hydropower plants; and 

around 20 thermal coal-fuelled power plants.  All these companies together generate around 70% of the 

country’s total electricity production. 

According to data published by TSO Transelectrica, Romania produced 8.1 TWh of electricity from renewable 

energy sources in 2015, a 3% increase from the previous year. Renewable energy thus accounted for 16% of 

the 51.74 TWh used in 2015. According to the Energy Ministry, Romania has met its objective of reaching total 

renewable energy of 24% for 2018; Romania has already reached 27%. 

 

7.3 Competition 

Current competitors of Restart Energy are the legacy energy suppliers owning distribution companies that also 

are licensed to sell their electricity and natural gas. By April 25, 2017, there were 258 licensed companies for 

supplying electric power and/or natural gas. Of them, 173 are registered for supplying electric power, 128 for 

natural gas (43 companies are licensed for both services)13. 

There are eight major distribution and system operators (DSOs) for electric power, one per region, which 

supplies to other regional distributors or companies. Some of them are state-owned while others are privately 

owned. Below are the privately owned companies: 

 

1. Enel (https://www.enel.ro): Enel is a global, vertically integrated energy company that manages and 

upgrades the electricity networks in the three regions of Banat, Dobrogea and South Muntenia. 

2. CEZ (http://www.cez.ro/ro): CEZ is the Czech national energy company that owns one distribution 

region in Romania. 

3. E.ON (https://www.eon-energie-romania.ro/): Eon is a German, vertically integrated energy company 

that supplies natural gas and electricity in Romania.  

4. Electrica (https://www.electrica.ro/): Electrica is a leader in the electricity distribution and supply 

market in Romania, as well as one of the most important companies in the energy services sector.  

 

After the launch of RED-P, Restart Energy will enter+45 deregulated energy markets around the world to 

serve the household and SME consumer segments.

8.  WHY BLOCKCHAIN 

A [public] blockchain is a continuously growing public ledger of records that is an independent, decentralized, 

verifiable, and permanent database coexisting in multiple locations shared by a community14. The records are 

arranged in data batches called blocks that follow a cryptographic validation method. That means each block 

references and identifies the previous block by a hashing function, forming an unbroken chain.  

 

Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two 

parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is 

typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. 

Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all 

subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority, which is nearly impossible. 

 

8.1 How blockchain works 

There are three main components that need to be combined to create a [public] blockchain. They are: 

1. Private key cryptography 

2. A distributed network with a shared ledger 

3. An incentive to service the network 

 

Private Key cryptography 
The main purpose of this component of blockchain technology is to create a secure digital identity reference. 

Identity is based on possession of a combination of private and public cryptographic keys. Each party that 

wishes to transact over the internet will hold a private key and a public key. The combination of these keys 

can be seen as a dexterous form of consent, creating extremely useful digital signatures. In turn, this digital 

signature provides strong control of ownership. 

 

 

                                                           
14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain 



 

55 
 

A distributed network with a shared ledger 
A network of so-called computing “nodes” is required to maintain a blockchain. A node can be any computer 

connected to the blockchain network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying 

transactions. A node gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically upon joining the 

blockchain network. 

When cryptographic keys are combined with this network, a useful form of digital interactions emerges. The 

process begins with one party broadcasting a block containing a digital signature, timestamp and relevant 

information to all nodes in the network. 

 

An incentive to service the network 
The nodes in a blockchain offer computer-processing power to service the network. There is a reward 

available for the nodes typically in cryptocurrency in exchange for their service. 

Cryptocurrency units must be unique to be owned and have value. To achieve this, the nodes serving the 

network create and maintain a history of transactions for each currency unit by working to solve proof-of-work 

mathematical problems and voting with their CPU power, expressing their agreement about new blocks or 

rejecting invalid blocks. This process is often called mining. When a majority of the miners arrives at the same 

solution, they add a new block to the chain. This block is time stamped, and can also contain data or 

messages. The type, amount and verification type can be different for each blockchain. It is a matter of the 

blockchain’s protocol – or rules for what is and is not a valid transaction or a valid creation of a new block. The 

process of verification can be tailored for each blockchain. Any needed rules and incentives can be created 

when enough nodes arrive at a consensus on how transactions ought to be verified.

56 
 

 

8.2 Advantages of blockchain technology 

Blockchain technology has the following inherent advantages. 

Immutability: Nothing on the blockchain can be changed without the consensus of the network. Any confirmed 

transactions on the blockchain cannot be changed. 

 

 Permanence: What happens on the blockchain stays on the blockchain. A public blockchain will act 

as a public ledger, meaning that as long as the blockchain remains operative, the data on it will be 

accessible. 

 

 Removal of intermediaries: The P2P nature of the blockchain does away with the need for 

intermediaries and users to interact directly with one another. With the removal of intermediaries and 

the distributed ledger being updated in real-time by the miners, any data inputted on the blockchain is 

transmitted and stored automatically.  

 

 Decentralization of consensus: With no central authority acting as a clearinghouse for transaction 

validation, the effort required to reach consensus is shared between the miners. 

 

 Transparency (pseudonymity): Public blockchains can offer full transparency of the transactions 

carried out on the network while safeguarding the privacy of its users through pseudonymity since 

only the transacting addresses are shown. 

 

 Speed: Blockchain results in a much faster process than a centrally controlled ledger. 

 

 Lower costs: The removal of intermediaries will result in lower transaction costs. 

 

 Security: With the encryption through cryptography, no one other than the sender and recipient can 

access the data sent across the blockchain. 

8.3 Blockchain Smart Contracts 

Blockchain technology enables the coding of simple contracts known as “smart contracts” that will execute 

when specified conditions are met. It is capable of facilitating, executing, and enforcing the negotiation or 

performance of a contract/agreement. The entire process is automated can act as a complement, or 

substitute, for legal contracts with superior security to traditional contract laws and reduce other transaction 

costs associated with contracting. 

Smart contracts are a very useful feature for the blockchain technology that can pave the way to a completely 

new scope of commercial and other applications of the blockchain technology as it can remove the 

intermediary required in commercial transactions.

8.4 The RED Platform Design 

Restart Energy Democracy platform (RED-P) will connect the final consumer to the producer directly using the 

existing grid via smart contracts within the frame and license of local private energy providers by managing 

their entire supply activity as a service and including them in the same virtual balancing group managed by 

the system. 

 

Fig. 17 Schematic of RED-P 

 

 
 

 

An energy supplier buys energy and sells it in retail, ensuring that production and consumption are matched 

with hourly settlements. Otherwise, it can lose money by not gaining the extra energy that was not consumed 

and by paying a high bill for the energy it did not have. 

 

Individual quantities exchanged inside the system will not affect the total energy balance because they are 

settled inside the system. This means it is possible for someone who owns an on-grid solar rooftop PV system 

to sell the energy he injects into the grid at peak times to someone who auctions for that energy on the RED-P 

using blockchain and the intelligent wireless meters and watt predict technology developed by Restart Energy 

to track and account for these energy exchanges inside the same virtual delimited balancing group. 

 

It will enable its users to buy, sell, trade electrical energy using KW tokens issued by the company. Restart 

Energy will allow physical delivery and offtake of the purchased or sold energy in the states where the 

company is licensed to supply or has agreements in place with local suppliers.  

 

Restart Energy’s wireless intelligent meters work together with the RED-P. The wireless meters developed by 

Restart Energy will measure produced and consumed energy and send this data using existing WiFi 

connections in real time to Restart Energy servers and the RED-P allowing for instantaneous P2P trading.  

 

 



 

59 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Intelligent WiFi metering system 

Restart Energy invested in a wireless, smart metering system that estimates power production for the next 

day. It takes data from different sources such as historical trends of sunlight and solar radiation, cloudy days 

at different time and location. The system recognizes the previously measured information, and the radar 

software anticipates the cloud movement.  

To make its RED-P more efficient and accurate, Restart Energy will integrate its smart metering system with 

the Watt Predict software with producers for hourly settlement. This system alone will help to predict the 

energy output and will allow for 30% more efficient energy transactions, settlements, supply, and trade. 

 

 

Existing energy supply software suite 

Our software engineers have developed the first integrated software suite for the Romanian power and gas 

markets. 

 

 

myRestart Mobile App 

Restart Energy developed a mobile application for Android and IOS to service its energy customers. The 

Restart Energy mobile app allows customers to see their energy consumption in real time (if they have wifi 

meters installed), send meter reading, view historical consumption, see and pay invoices, 24h support, send 

messages and notifications, update personal info, view scheduled grid repairs and latest news on

9  PROMOTION STRATEGY A ND MARKET TRACTION 

The market development of Central and Eastern Europe is at an intermediate phase between Western markets 

and quickly growing emerging markets. Different stages being already accomplished we can find different 

levels of market maturity present. 

 

Evolving rhythms are different from market to market and also Balkans countries are characterized by being 

significantly more fragmented compared to Western Europe.   

 

Restart Energy development started on Romanian market, the biggest market in the Balkans. 

 

 
 

Romania, as part of the European Union single market, is a fast developing, upper-middle income mixed 

economy with a skilled labor force.  It is the 16th largest in the European Union by total nominal GDP and the 

13th largest based on purchasing power parity. 

 

The Romanian economy is the 49st-largest economy in the world (out of 190 countries measured by IMF) with 

$204.943 billion annual output, and ranks 63st in the world with in terms of GDP per capita measured by 

purchasing power parity 15 . Romanian economy is expected to grow by +6% in 2017. Based on current 

economic growth, it's expected to hit 1 trillion of USD PPP before 2035. Romania continues to be one of the 

leading nations in Central and Eastern Europe for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI): the inward FDI in 

the country with a cumulative FDI totaling more than $170 billion since 1989. 

Romania is the largest electronics producer in Central and Eastern Europe.  

 

Up until the late 2000s financial crisis, the Romanian economy had been referred to as a "Tiger" due to its 

high growth rates and rapid development. Until 2009, Romanian economic growth was among the fastest in 

Europe (officially 8.4% in 2008 and more than three times the EU average). Romania is rich in iron ore, oil,

salt, uranium, nickel, copper and natural gas. The country is a regional leader in multiple fields, such as IT and 

motor vehicle production.  

Bucharest, the capital city, is one of the largest financial and industrial centers in Eastern Europe. According to 

Eurostat Romania posted the biggest economic growth in EU in 2016 by more than 6% increase of GDP. 

The projections for economic growth in Romania for 2018 and 2019 were both lifted by 0.3 percentage points 

to 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, the World Bank said in its June 2017 Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report.  

Restart Energy’s strategy outlined below is designed and used for the Romanian market. For the global 

expansion of RED to +35 countries, Restart Energy will develop a sales strategy tailored to each country’s 

needs and ecosystem.  

Since its inception, Restart Energy continues to grow aggressively. It has successfully developed a 

multichannel sales strategy by quickly identifying market opportunities and leveraging local resources such as 

micro-entrepreneurs through the first retail energy franchise in the European Union. Sales channels currently 

used for supplying energy and gas in Romania are as below: 

 

1. Local distribution partners who acquire a franchise and sell energy to their long-standing customer. 

This strategy has proved very successful so far and will be a major contribution to the national expansion.  

 

2. Formation of local D2D teams around the best local franchised partners.

10   TOKEN MODEL 

 
Restart Energy is committed to building a socially responsible business.  The token generation event, in 

addition to being structured in accordance with all regulatory requirements, is established as a reward based 
crowdfunding campaign, where contributors will receive RED MegaWatt Tokens. 

 
In exchange of access to RED platform energy producers and suppliers are requested to allocate between 1% 

and 5% of all the energy they produce and trade on the RED platform to a transparent RED community 

energy fund from where it will be distributed proportionally to RED MegaWatt Token owners accounts on a 

monthly basis.  The token model takes into consideration that energy producers will be able to sell their 

energy on the RED-P to smaller household and SME consumers at retail prices 30% higher compared to 

wholesale prices while the consumers will purchase that energy 30% cheaper compared to the normal retail 

price. 

 

Thus, by allocating the remaining 1%-5% energy to RED community in exchange of the access to RED-P, 

energy producers will sell the remaining 99% - 95% of annual energy produced with 30% more than the 

wholesale prices (18.75% gain). 

 

Restart Energy will operate with a two-token model, the RED and KW tokens, with each token being ERC-20 

compliant. 

 

 

 

 

 

10.1 RED MegaWatt Token 

The RED MegaWatt Token will be issued by Restart Energy in the TGE (Token Generation Event) and will carry 

an initial charge of 0.11 KW Tokens/MWAT, that the holder may choose to consume or trade on the RED 

platform together with the energy related rights. The RED MegaWatt Tokens are necessary to access the RED 

platform software and the RED franchise. In addition, the tokens will be listed in the popular cryptocurrency 

exchanges where they can be traded freely. The KW energy tokens contained in the MWAT tokens will be 

replenished evenly from the Community Energy Fund on a monthly basis in the token holder accounts. 

 

The energy will be allocated by energy producers and suppliers in the form of KW tokens and stored in the 

Ethereum smart contracts. The RED platform will provide access to the green energy which the token holder 

can either use or sell to another. In exchange for access to the RED platform, renewable energy producers 

and suppliers are required to allocate between 1% and 5% from each energy transaction on the platform to 

the Community Energy Fund from where it will be evenly distributed to the RED MegaWatt Token holders’ 

according to the number of MWAT tokens owned. The more renewable energy producers and suppliers are 

using RED, the more energy is allocated to the community fund. RED MegaWatt Token holders can consume 

the allocated energy or sell it on the RED platform at any time. This ensures liquidity for the contributors, 

especially if they are from places where Restart Energy is not yet connected to the energy infrastructure or 

doesn’t have a franchise in place and cannot receive the energy via supply contracts. 

 

 

 

 

 



63 

Owning RED MegaWatt Tokens grants the holders free access to the RED Franchises as follows: 

10,000 Tokens - RED City Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in their city 
of residence 
100,000 Tokens - RED Regional Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in an 
entire region of their country of residence 
1,000,000 Tokens - Red Country Franchise - allows token holders to sell energy in their 
entire country of residence 
10,000,000+ Tokens - RED Master Franchise - gives the token holder exclusive rights in 

his/her country of resident and the option to create sub-franchises inside that country. 

10.2 KW token 

The transactions on the RED platform will be done using KW tokens. Each 1 KW token will be equivalent to 1 

unit of energy and it will be purchased by the users of the RED platform with crypto and fiat currencies in 

order to be consumed or sold on the RED platform. The RED MegaWatt Token holders will receive KW tokens 

proportional to the number of RED MegaWatt Tokens owned.  

11  TGE (TOKEN GENERATION EVENT)  STRUCTURE

12.3 RED Platform Expansion Plan 

Given below is the expansion plan for the RED Platform, including the markets where we want to enter. The 

platform will be fully developed and tested in 2018 and we expect to start its global expansion in the last 

quarter of the year. Until then, Restart Energy will continue its plans of expansion the actual franchised energy 

supplying business in the Central & Eastern Europe. The expansion plan was made taking into consideration 

only the jurisdictions (countries or states for US/Canada) that have at least started the liberalization process 

for their energy markets or publicly declared that have plans of liberalization. Given this, we mention that the 

presented expansion plan is subject to external factors such as changes of the energy-related legislation from 

the selected countries or other potential markets.

Message to contributors from  

Restart Energy founder 

 

Restart Energy is my legacy to the world, it’s my dream of creating a transparent energy eco system that 

allows and encourages free and direct energy transfers between people that have the possibility to choose 

renewable energy without limitations from sources they can trust.  

 

We became the fastest growing independent energy company in an 

European Country by tapping into the vast potential of micro 

entrepreneurship and creating new jobs with the Restart Energy 

franchise. Restart Energy token generative event is a black swan event 

for energy monopolies, its history in the making. By buying RED 

MegaWatt Tokens, you get an opportunity to participate in a great 

business success story while making money in the process.  
 

FAQ 
 

Function 

 

How does RED work? 

RED MWAT Token is an ERC20 digital cryptographic utility token issued by Restart Energy Democracy, using 

blockchain technology that gives access to the services provided on the RED Platform Software and the RED 
Franchise. This will be achieved thanks to the new service offered by Restart Energy Democracy worldwide, 

RED platform. 

 

RED Platform 

The RED Platform Software is a blockchain based decentralized platform for Peer to Peer direct energy trading 

between consumers and energy producers worldwide. RED platform is the platform where users (and Restart 

Energy clients) can log in and trade (buy; sell) energy directly P2P (peer-to-peer), in a decentralized and easy 
to use manner. Users can get access to Restart Energy services, also obtain and use electricity. 
 

RED Franchise 

The RED Franchise is the first power retail franchise that makes it simple and easy to start and operate your 

own power utility company. Allows token holders to develop its own power retail business and earn revenues 

by selling energy to retail households and business consumers RED franchise is the business opportunity that 

owners of RED MWAT can get access to. It is an innovative, tested and working idea that is growing in a rapid 

manner. The energy franchise brings the decentralized world of energy one step closer to the free market in 

energy sector.

RED MWAT Token use 

Do we generate all tokens at once?

Yes. Once the smart contract is created! 

What happens with unsold MWAT Tokens? 

Unsold tokens will be burned. 

Will it be secondary (non-RED-P) trading exchanges for RED and KW token? 

MWAT Tokens are received in your ETH wallet and they are used to access RED platform. You can sell or buy 
them on any of the secondary (Non-RED platform) markets that will start listing MWAT.  

KW, on the other hand, is an internal use token, that has a direct report to RED Platform as a representation 
of an energy unit. 

Can I refill any time my MWAT token with energy at a preferred price? 

Your MWAT Tokens give you access to trade up to 1000 KW Tokens/Month on the RED Platform Software. 

Am I limited to use the MWAT token for a certain market? 

You can access the RED platform from anywhere in the world and use the P2P energy exchange, however 

Restart Energy can only deliver electricity in countries where the company will be licensed as a private energy 

supplier or where a Type A RED Franchise is deployed. 

Can I pay my bills with energy stored on the blockchain? 

Yes! That is the basic functionality, among others. The KW Tokens that you purchase on the RED Platform 
represent units of energy that will be deducted from your energy invoice if you are a customer of Restart 
Energy or of a RED Franchise. 

If I choose to pay my bills using the KW tokens where I can find conversion rate?

Calculated LIVE on our platform. 

Are MWAT Tokens consumed if I use or sell the associated KW tokens? 

MWAT Tokens are not consumed or used if you use or sell the associated KW Tokens. Think of MWAT like 

“virtual batteries” and KW Tokens represent units of energy that fill up the MWAT Tokens accounts. 

How can I obtain/use Green Certificates? 

Consumers holding RED Tokens will automatically receive 1 Cryptographic Green Certificate for each 1 MWh 

consumed from renewable sources. The green certificates will be tradable on a secondary market on the RED 

platform and companies/contributors around the world will have access to purchase them in order to support 

renewable energy consumption/production and reduce their carbon footprint. 



 

78 
 

 

RED Platform use 

 

If I 'consume' MWAT Tokens do I get one time KW 'fill' on RED platform? 

RED MWAT Tokens grants you access on the platform (FREE), as you consume the energy in the form of KW 
Tokens that is deposited in the batteries, not the batteries itself. 

If I keep MWAT Tokens (on RED platform) will I get a monthly / yearly KW 'fill' on 
MWAT Tokens? 

Yes, monthly your RED MWAT Tokens accounts will receive KW tokens provided by the producers as a fee for 

accessing the RED Platform. In order for this electricity to be consumed, the token holder has to be an energy 
customer of Restart Energy or a RED Franchise. 

Can I sell RED MegaWatt Tokens on the platform at any moment? 

Yes, on secondary markets! Restart Energy will provide access to the RED Platform to its existing 30,000 

customers only if they own RED Tokens. Owning the tokens gives access to a P2P global energy exchange 

platform. Restart Energy won’t buy the tokens back. 

 

 

 

RED Franchise use 

 

What type of resources will be received as benefit from a franchise? 

You will get energy and profit from running the franchise business. 

Can I upgrade a city franchise to regional/country later in time? 

Yes! On the first-come first-served principle, if the area isn’t reserved already. 

How will I benefit from an externalized service of purchasing electricity? 

Just like everybody benefits from free market principles, you will find the best prices on the decentralized 

network, but even better, you can optimize your energy costs by purchasing directly from producers and 

choose the renewable sources you want to promote.

DISCLAIMER - RISKS AND DISCLOSURES 
 

Disclaimer and main - Risks  

Please read this disclaimer notice carefully. Please note that the disclaimer set out below may be altered or 

updated, at any time in whole or in part at the sole discretion of the Company. You should read it in full each 
time you visit the site. 

All information is provided without any warranties of any kind and the Company. and its advisors make no

infringement, suitability of the Tokens for any prospective contributor, and the Company and its employees, 

officers or professional advisors assume no responsibility to you or any third party for the consequence of 

errors or omissions. 

Regulatory Risks 

The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled 

in many jurisdictions, herein included also the Romanian jurisdiction.  It is difficult to predict how or whether 
governmental authorities will regulate such technologies or what tax implications could arise for the holders of 

the RED MWAT tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make 

changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, 
blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact RED MWAT Tokens in 

various ways, including, for example, through a determination that RED MWAT Tokens are regulated financial 
instruments that require registration. Company may cease the distribution of RED MWAT Tokens, the 

development of the Project or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it 

unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. 

The industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, 

including investigations or enforcement actions.  There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will 

not examine the operations of Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against Company.  Such 

governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular.  All of this may 

subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations 

and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company’s reputation 

or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the RED MWAT 

Tokens and/or the development of the Project.

certain categories of person may be allowed to view such materials. Any person who wishes to view these 

materials must first satisfy themselves that they are not subject to any local requirements that prohibit or 

restrict them from doing so. 

The materials are for information purposes only and do not constitute or form a part of any offer or invitation

Accordingly, unless an exemption under the relevant securities law is applicable, the Tokens may not be 

offered, sold, pledged, taken up, exercised, resold, renounced, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, 

in or into a restricted territory where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of, or require 

registration thereof in, such jurisdiction.

There will be no public offering of the Tokens in the restricted territories. If you are not permitted to view 

materials on this webpage or are in any doubt as to whether you are permitted to view these materials, please 

exit this webpage. 

The Company shall not have any responsibility in respect of access to it from territories whose laws prohibit 

such access or where any aspect of the content of the site may be illegal. Those who choose to access this 

site from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance 

with applicable local laws. 

Currency Regulation Risks 

Governments are still grappling with public policy on the regulation of cryptocurrencies as a form of settlement 

in trade. Governments adverse to the proliferation of the use of crypto -currencies in local commerce could 

issue laws and regulations deeming the use of crypto-currencies a regulated activity. In recent weeks, 

countries such as China and Korea have issued regulations or statements prohibiting token sales, United 

States allowing only certified investors to participate to the sale while other countries have sought to bring the 

sale of tokens within the regulator control of securities offerings. This could result in holders of RED MWAT 

token being unable to use their RED MWAT token in the future without further regulatory compliance by RED 

MWAT token. 

Risks Associated with Use of RED token Network 

Use of crypto-currency exchanges can be complex and subject to stringent qualification requirements. There is 

no guarantee that the developers will be able to successfully create a system that allows payment for services 

using global crypto-currencies. The failure to establish a network will result in decreased liquidity of the RED 

MWAT token as a form of settlement currency within the RED MWAT token Network. 

Risks Associated With Crowd Sale 

RED MWAT tokens are not investment products. Rather, RED MWAT token serve a specific function within the 

RED Platform Software and RED ecosystem, which is the means to access and purchase active energy at a 
lower cost. Without RED MWAT token, the general public may not access the RED MWAT token system. There 

is also no expectation of future profit or gain from the acquisition of RED MWAT token. For these and other 

reasons, we believe the sale of RED MWAT token does not constitute a public offering of securities subject to 
prospectus registration requirements. However, public policy towards token sales is changing, and it is 

conceivable that regulators may in the future seek to broaden the scope of regulation of token sales. This 
could make token sales subject to registration requirements in the United States and similar jurisdictions. If 

the RED MWAT token sale becomes subject to registration requirements, this would delay or potentially 
postpone the proposed RED MWAT token sale indefinitely. 

Taxation Risks 

The use of RED MWAT token as a form of settlement currency may or may not be subject to local income tax, 

capital gain taxes, VAT or other forms of taxes. This uncertainty in tax legislation may expose merchants and 
customers alike to unforeseen future tax consequences associated with the use of RED MWAT token Coin as a 

settlement currency, and/or the trading of tokens or RED MWAT token for capital gains. 

Capital Control Risks Many jurisdictions, such as China impose strict controls on the cross-border flow of 

capital. Holders of RED MWAT token may be subject to these regulations and/or arbitrary enforcement of such 

regulations at any time. This would make the transfer of RED MWAT token out of the local jurisdiction to 

overseas exchanges an unlawful activity exposing the user of RED MWAT token to government fines or other 

regulatory sanction. 

CTF and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 

The United States has issued a series of regulations to combat terrorist financing (CTF) and money-laundering 

activities. Many other countries have enacted similar legislation to control the flow of capital for such illicit 



 

81 
 

activities. The use of crypto-currencies by bad actors would breach such regulations. Any illicit use of the RED 

MWAT token could seriously impact the global reputation of the RED token Network. In such event, it is not 

inconceivable that this could trigger scrutiny by CTF and anti-money laundering regulators and potentially 

cause significant disruption to the distribution and circulation of tokens and RED MWAT token in the RED 

token ecosystem. 

Blockchain Risks 

On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production 

can occur at random times. For example, ETH contributed to the RED MWAT token Distribution Contract in the 
final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and 

understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyer’s transaction at the time Buyer expects 

and Buyer may not receive RED MWAT token the same day Buyer sends ETH. The Ethereum blockchain is 
prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also 

intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic 
tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include Buyer’s 

transaction when Buyer wants or Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all. RED MWAT token may be 

subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to 
interfere with the RED MWAT token Distribution Contract or the RED MWAT token in a variety of ways, 

including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil 
attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software 

and RED MWAT token are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts 
may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the RED MWAT 

token or result in the loss of Buyer’s RED MWAT token, the loss of Buyer’s ability to access or control Buyer’s 

RED MWAT token or the loss of ETH in Buyer’s account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, 
there may be no remedy and holders of RED MWAT token are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or 

compensation. The Project and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. The 
Project might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain 

utilizing the Project will ever be launched and there may never be an operational platform. Even if the Project 

is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a 
blockchain adopting the Project may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is 

changing rapidly, so the RED MWAT token and the Project may become outdated. The regulatory status of 
cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It 

is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise 
difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations 

and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. 

Such changes could negatively impact RED MWAT token in various ways, including, for example, through a 
determination that RED MWAT token are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company 

may cease the distribution of RED MWAT token, the development of the Project or cease operations in a 
jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to 

do so. 

Buyer Knowledge and Risks of Project 

Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, including a sufficient 

understanding of blockchain or cryptographic tokens and other digital assets, smart contracts, storage 

mechanisms (such as digital or token wallets), blockchain-based software systems and blockchain technology, 

to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of Buyer’s purchase of RED MWAT Tokens, including but not 

limited, to the matters set forth in this Agreement, and is able to bear the risks thereof, including loss of all 

amounts paid, loss of RED MWAT Tokens, and liability to the Company Parties and others for its acts and 

omissions. Buyer has obtained sufficient information in order to make an informed decision to purchase RED 

MWAT Tokens. 

The Project and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested.  The Project might not 

be capable of completion, implementation or adoption.  It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the Project

will ever be launched and there may never be an operational platform.  Even if the Project is completed, 

implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain 

adopting the Project may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable.  Also, technology is changing 

rapidly, so the RED MWAT Tokens and the Project may become outdated. 

Business Risks 

The Company plans to conduct closings of sales of RED MWAT token as funds are received. If less than 
5,000,000 USD is received from the sale of RED MWAT token, the Company may have insufficient cash to 

implement its plans as described below, and RED MWAT token purchasers who bought the Tokens shall be at 
a heightened risk of loss of their contributions. The Company’s principal competitors may have greater 

financial resources than those available to the Company and thus be in a better position to attract talent, 

initiate projects and offer lower prices for electricity which is a crucial factor for miners of bitcoin. The 
Company’s ability to remain competitive may depend in part upon its ability to develop new and enhanced 

products or services and to introduce these products or services in a timely and cost-effective manner. In 
addition, product and service introductions or enhancements by the Company’s competitors or the use of other 

technologies could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the Company’s existing products 
and services. There can be no assurances that the Company shall be successful in selecting, developing, and 

marketing new products and services or in enhancing its existing products or services. Failure to do so 

successfully may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The 
Company’s ability to realize its objectives shall be dependent on its ability to attract and retain additional, 

qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and there can be no assurance that the 
Company’s results shall not be adversely affected by difficulty in attracting and/or retaining qualified 

personnel. The industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and 

scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental 
authorities will not examine the operations of Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against Company. 

Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular. All of this may 
subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations 

and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company’s reputation 

or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the RED MWAT token 
and/or the development of the Project. 

Further on, any transaction concluded based on this Whitepaper shall be considered as a random agreement 

(in Romanian language called “contract aleatoriu”), meaning that the length and even the enforceability of the 

rights provided herein is not known/entirely know at the moment of its signing, given that the main rights and 
obligations of this agreement depend on one or several future events and therefore any of the signing party 

bear the risk of winning or losing depending on such future events.

Date:  22.12.2017

was requested and issued for the sole benefit of the Client and A&A does not represent and 

assume no liability towards third parties. 

Our analysis is limited to the Romanian regulations and official opinions existent in relation 

to securities regime at the issuance date of this Memo and, further on, expresses no opinion

1 SCOPE OF WORK  

The use of blockchains and tokens gives raise to legal and regulatory challenges & regulators 

worldwide are starting to understand and further define the general applicable rules. 

Thus, most of the national regulators and EU authorities are already monitoring the 

development of blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies (as well as the virtual 

currencies exchanged on them). 

It is stated that regulators should control less the technology itself, but the uses and 

products that may be promoted based on such technology.  

National Bank of Romania (BNR) announced that “the cryptocurrency is not a national 

currency nor a foreign currency, and its acceptance for payment is not mandatory from legal 

point of view; the cryptocurrency is neither a „virtual currency” as such is regulated by Law 

127/2011 regarding the activity of issuance of virtual currency.” 

The rest of the Romanian authorities still haven’t expressed an official interpretation over the 

tokens legal regime, ICOs and blockchain technology. 

In light of the before mentioned and in lack of any special Romanian regulations referring to 

tokens, we are of the opinion that the final legal regime which one should reasonably grant 

to tokens is determined by the uses and products mediated by such technology.  

Therefore, our herein analysis is based on the information provided by the Client and the use 

and purpose which the latter aims to grant to the subject tokens, purpose which is further in 

a limitative manner detailed herein below:   

 RED MWAT token holders can access the RED Platform energy exchange and have 

access to select the energy producers from which to acquire energy rights. 

 With each 1 RED MWAT token the users can virtually buy or sell up to 1 MWh per 

month on the RED Platform. 

 Energy producers also need RED MWAT tokens to access the RED Platform and 

they pay as a fee 5% of the traded energy to the platform that distributes this energy 

monthly and evenly as a free discount to the RED Token account holder. 

 Users holding a minimum number of tokens can receive access to a RED Franchise 

for brokering energy and gas contracts.

2 CAPITAL MARKET REGULATIONS   

 

One of the key problem lies in whether a token is or might be considered a security/financial 

instrument, in which case and if the answer is positive such an approach triggers the 

application of financial regulations. 

Law 297/2004 regulates among others the set-up and functioning of financial instrument 

markets and the deeds and operations specific to such markets and applies to the activities 

and operations with financial instruments developed on the Romanian territory, such as: 

- the reception and transmission of orders for one or more financial instruments;  

- the execution of orders on behalf of clients;  

- dealing on own account;  

- portfolio management;  

- investment advice;  

- underwriting and/or placing financial instruments based on a firm commitment;  

- placing financial instruments without a firm commitment;  

- administration of an alternative trading system. 

Further on, as per Law 24/2017, financial instruments have the following meaning:  

- securities;  

- money-market instruments;  

- units of undertakings for collective investment;  

- options, futures contracts, swaps, forward interest-rate agreements, forward exchange 

rate, and any derivative contracts in connection with securities, currencies, interest 

rates or profitability or other derivatives, financial indices or financial ratios, which 

may be physically settled or in monetary funds;  

- options, futures contracts, swaps, forward interest-rate agreements (one rate) and any 

other derivative contracts in connection with commodities which must be settled in 

monetary funds, or may be settled in monetary funds, at the request of any party (other 

than in the case of default or other incident leading to termination);  



 

4/5 
 

- options, futures contracts, swaps and any other derivative contracts in connection with 

commodities/goods and which may be physically settled, provided that they are traded 

on a regulated market and/or within an alternative trading system;  

- options, futures contracts, swaps, forward contracts and any other derivative contracts 

in connection with commodities, which may be physically settled, not included in the 

category of those referred above and not having commercial purposes, having the 

features of other derivatives, taking into account, inter alia, whether they are 

compensated and settled through recognized clearing houses or are regularly subject 

to margin calls; derivative instruments for the transfer of credit risks; etc. 

About such activities and operations with financial instruments, Law 297 states that “No 

natural or legal person may supply investment services and activities without being 

registered in the CNVM’s Registry.” The investment services and activities referred to as 

financial instruments, may be supplied under a professional title exclusively by the 

intermediaries provided and authorized under the same law: 

- the investment firms and intermediaries in non-Member States, based on the 

authorization granted by CNVM;  

- the credit institutions, authorized by the National Bank of Romania;  

- the equivalent of credit institutions and of investment firms, authorized by the 

competent authorities of the Member States. 

Further on it is mentioned that the alternative trading systems may be operated solely by 

authorized intermediaries or by the market operator, hereinafter referred to as system 

operators: 

- The securities which do not meet the requirements for admission to trading on a 

regulated market may be traded within such an alternative trading system.  

- The system operators shall submit for approval by CNVM their intention to establish 

an alternative trading system and shall request its approval; the system management, 

the complete description of its features and the operation rules shall be submitted to 

CNVM for approval. 

Among others, Law 297/2004  states that financial investment services can be carried in a 

“professional manner” solely by authorized intermediaries, such as: SSIFs  - financial 

investment service companies which provide these services both for third parties and for their 



 

5/5 
 

own behalf; traders authorized by CNVM  and which perform transactions with financial 

instruments (of futures and options type) only in their own name and behalf; intermediaries 

of other EU member states etc; central counterparty (CCP) and clearance house etc. 

Among these financial investment services which can be carried on in a professional manner 

solely by authorized intermediaries, the following should be emphasized: 

- intermediation and placement of orders regarding one or several financial 

instruments; 

- trading on its own name and account; 

- consultancy services for investments etc. 

3  CONCLUSIONS  

 Considering the before mentioned Romanian securities regulations and the 

purpose & use of the RED MWAT token as declared by the Client and detailed in 

chapter 1 above, we are of the opinion that, in light of the current date Romanian 

legislation and official interpretation, RED MWAT tokens cannot be deemed as being 

securities; 

 Should in the future, REO intend to extend the purpose & use of the RED 

MWAT token to activities covered by the securities law regulations as detailed in 

chapter 2 above, this Memorandum should be extended based on the new de facto 

situation.
