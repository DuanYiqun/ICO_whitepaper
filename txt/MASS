ABSTRACT 
The goal of this white paper is to outline the process of MASS token investments. MASS tokens are an 

ERC20 derivative and represent a share of a pool of funds used to stake in proof-of-stake (PoS) 

cryptocurrencies and the creation of masternodes. Staked token holders receive a fair share of rewards 

paid out by PoS and masternode currencies automatically and continuously. Token holders are also able 

to burn their entire share of MASS for a fair share of the entire Ethereum pool, minus 10%.  

After the presale and ICO phase, MASS Cloud Ltd. receives 10% of the raised Ethereum to fund 

development and pay for initial operating costs. Bounty programs and commitments made prior to the 

launch each will each be given 1% of the total Ethereum and MASS. That leaves 88% of the total Ethereum 

for the investment pool. MASS Cloud Ltd. will also receive 10% of the total MASS sold which will be locked 

and untradeable for 1 year and its rewards will be used to grow the pool. Rewards from unstaked MASS 

tokens will be placed back into the pool for additional growth. After launch, there are no additional fees 

or percentages taken from rewards that are paid out. Only unstaked MASS can be traded or transferred. 

Block rewards are based on the amount of MASS and time they have been staked since the last block 

reward. The total number of tokens available for sale is capped at 61 million. 

INTRODUCTION 
Most cryptocurrencies rely on vast amounts of computing power to find a valid solution and submit a 

proof-of-work claim in order to obtain the reward. Examples of such currencies include Bitcoin, Litecoin, 

Ethereum (currently), Dogecoin, and Namecoin. As these types of currencies became more popular, the 

amount of energy needed to run mining hardware increases. The barrier of entry to competing on these 

currencies is twofold; the costs of hardware and the cost of electricy. 

Recently, however, more cryptocurrencies are migrating to, or launching as, proof-of-stake. Traditionally, 

proof-of-stake pays out block rewards based on a set annual percentage rate (APR) in the parameters 

defined by the developers of the coin. More recent projects have opted to reward a static amount per 

block. Since most wallets don’t support offline staking, it is critical that your wallet remain online with 

stable and reliable server hosting. Currencies using PoS include NXT, peercoin, PIVX and soon Ethereum. 

Proof-of-stake currencies and masternodes both reward primarily on the value of the wallet. The wallets 

help maintain the integrity of the entire currency while masternodes perform more computational-critical 

roles. Getting a noticeable return on vestments (ROI) in proof-of-stake currencies requires substantial 

initial investment. That investment is locked into a single currency. Many of these currencies do not 

support offline staking, so the wallet would be required to have almost continuous uptime for it to remain 

competitive enough to receive block rewards. 

Managing all of these currencies and keeping track of trading, buying, and selling is a daunting task for 

people that cannot do this full-time. MASS Cloud Ltd. bridges the gap between ease of use and currency 

fluidity. Our platform performs the trades, buys and sells on select coins, and automatically converts block 

rewards to Ethereum when paid out.

MINING 
The type of hardware and cost of operation varies depending upon the cryptocoin. Bitcoin started off on 

CPU miners, then was overtaken by high-end AMD video cards, and now it is overwhelmingly controlled 

by specialized ASIC hardware. These ASIC miners can run over a thousand dollars for a single high-powered 

unit1 and power supply2. This unit offers 13.5 terahash per second and recommends a 1600-watt power 

supply. Using an online calculator3, we can see our return on investment given the specifications of the 

miner, power usage, energy cost, and expected growth rate of 10.25% every 2 weeks.

Figure 2 - Bitcoin Mining Returns 

With one unit and the steady rise of difficulty, you would never pay off the initial investment. This can be 

extrapolated to any number of these machines; the rate at which the difficulty raises outpaces the profit. 

Bitcoin would need an ever-increasing rise in demand for the return to come close. 

Mining Ethereum is still profitable after several months on a modest investment. This is all going to change 

in the near future when Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake4. The details of their PoS implementation have 

not been finalized yet, so the cost of entry is still undetermined. 

For example, in order to run and maintain your own Dash masternode (a popular PoS/Masternode 

cryptocurrency), you must have at least 1000 Dash5 in a wallet at all times. Dash currently trades for 

around $1506, which means an initial investment of $150,000 is needed to start a masternode on the Dash 

blockchain. This does not include the cost of hardware, or securing the wallet against attack.

MASS CLOUD LTD. 
MASS Cloud Ltd., a Hong Kong-based company, manages the high cost of entry in proof-of-stake and 

masternode currencies, difficulties in keeping the wallets filled and online at all times, and managing 

trades between currencies to prevent over funding a single one. We are a team of career professionals 

with backgrounds in Fortune 300 companies. We believe in the idea of making cryptocurrency less 

resource intensive by using proof-of-stake implementation, and are bringing what it offers to the public 

by reducing the cost of investment and complexity in monitoring multiple currencies over multiple 

exchanges. Our backgrounds are in software engineering, security, virtualization, cluster computing, high-

availability ecommerce front ends and back ends, as well as continuous monitoring, trading, and advising 

on newly announced currencies and ICOs. 

Our goal is to provide a new method of investing fiat currency into a continuously growing cryptocurrency 

fund that pays out block rewards automatically and fairly across all token holders. We are a company that 

is taking all of the nuances of investing into different cryptocurrencies, and bringing them together in a 

simple, coherent and secure platform. Because of our faith in this project, we are locking our share of the 

MASS tokens for 1 year. Also during that period, we will be unable to trade or transfer the tokens received 

as part of the ICO7. The rewards from those shares will go back into the pool to help increase the size of 

the underlying assets held by MASS. This will increase the number of rewards holders receive. This heavily 

benefits all token holders during this time as it 1) increases rewards while staking, and 2) increases value 

for the MASS token itself, because the underlying assets are also increasing. By the end of the 1 year 

locked period, we project that the fund will be in a stable growth that MASS Cloud Ltd.’s employees can 

begin to receive payouts from their shares. 

TRANSPARENCY & TRUST 
We want to be as transparent and open as possible, while also offering the most security for all token 

holders. All wallets under the control of the team will be multi-signature wallets to ensure a higher level 

of security and accountability. Once the ICO ends, the remaining funds (after we receive our 10% share), 

will be transferred to a new smart contract that will act on behalf of the pool. This contract will perform 

the following actions: 

 Publish outgoing Ethereum addresses with a waiting period of one week before funds are sent. 

 Publish all staking and masternode wallet addresses along with their transactions to both the 

blockchain and our website. 

 Publish all exchange wallet addresses along with their transactions to both the blockchain and our 

website. 

 Transactions above 30% of the entire pool will have a waiting period of one week before being 

released. 

 Announce and approve a list of new coins to invest in that the MASS token holders voted on. 

 Rebalance currencies to ensure no more than 30% of the pool is invested in a single currency. 

 Currencies that have a 200%+ return when rebalanced will reward all token holders a share of 

10% of the return. 

 Prevent Ethereum transactions to unapproved addresses. 

 Keep a public record of all outgoing expenditures so that all transactions can be tracked.

 Create a kill switch that will liquidate all currencies and convert to Ethereum then release the 

funds to all token holders. This will only be invoked in case of emergencies

MASS TOKENS 
MASS tokens are purchased at an exchange rate of 1000 tokens per Ethereum. During pre-sale, purchases 

are given 30% more tokens until it closes 14 days later or reaches its cap of 10 million tokens. Once the 

ICO starts, purchases during the first 5 million tokens will receive 20% more and tokens purchased during 

the next 10 million will receive 10% more, purchases made after the 2nd phase ends will receive no bonus. 

The tokens are locked during the presale and the ICO and will be released upon the completion of the ICO. 

There is a cap of 61 million MASS tokens in total. 

The following flowchart helps visualize the structure of the contract and pooling system: 

 

Figure 5 - MASS Token Flowchart 



9 
 

1. Tokens are purchased by sending Ethereum to the contract. The exchange rate is based on how 

many tokens have been sold and can be seen in the contract source.8 

2. After sending Ethereum, the contract allocates MASS tokens to the sender’s address. 

3. Once the ICO ends, token holders can send a message to the contract to stake their tokens. 

4. Staked tokens cannot be transferred, traded, or burned. 

5. These staked tokens will give holders a fair payout of rewards. 

6. Unstaked tokens can be traded, sold or burned, but their shares of the rewards are reinvested 

into the pool. 

7. Burning tokens will give the owner a fair percentage of the total Ethereum value of MASS Cloud 

Ltd., minus a burn fee to prevent abuse and market manipulation as well as manual oversight. 

Once the ICO ends and the funds are released to a wallet controlled by our back end system, they will be 

invested into multiple supported currencies and masternodes. Regardless of if tokens are staked or not, 

their Ethereum equivalent will be put to use by the pool. Block rewards are paid out based on the amount 

of MASS staked for each owner and the amount of time the tokens spent being staked. 

𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 =
𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑑𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆

𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆
∗

𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑑𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠

𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠
 

If tokens are unstaked between rewards, their share decreases and the remainder goes back into the pool. 

This is to prevent token owners from only staking right before a block reward is expected to pay out. The 

following formula shows the ratios between them. 

 

𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 =  (
𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑑𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆

𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆
) −  (

𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑑𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆

𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆
∗  

𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑑𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠

𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠
) 

To put this to use, let’s take the following example. Bob owns 1000 MASS tokens. The total MASS of the 

pool is 10,000 MASS. Bob was staked for 25 out of the 28 blocks between rewards. 

𝑏𝑜𝑏𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 =
1000

10000
∗

25

28
= 0.0893 

Bob gets 8.93% of their expected share. The remainder goes into the pool: 

𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 =  (
1000

10000
) −  (

1000

10000
∗ 

25

28
) = 0.0107 

The pool receives 10.7% of the reward to not only boost the value of the pool, but to also reinvest these 

rewards into new coins and masternodes. 

Tokens that are lost and are not staked will not have a negative impact on the pool, since unstaked tokens 

receive no reward. Staked tokens will always receive their share of block rewards until they are marked 

as unstaked.

BONUS STRUCTURE 

 

Figure 6 - ICO Bonus Schedule 

During presale and the ICO, purchases can receive extra tokens up to a certain limit9. We are setting a cap 

of 10 million tokens to be sold during the presale. During this time, all purchases will be given 30% more 

tokens. Once the ICO starts, the bonus structure will change to the following: 

 Phase 1 of the ICO will offer 20% more tokens on purchases on the first 5 million tokens. This is 

outside of the tokens sold during the presale. 

 Phase 2 of the ICO will offer 10% more tokens on purchases on the next 10 million tokens. 

 Phase 3 of the ICO will offer no bonus tokens and a flat exchange rate of 1000 tokens per 

Ethereum is set. 

INVESTMENT VOTING 
Investment voting is part of our road map, and will be implemented in the near future outside of the 

original contract. Voting will initially work by allowing token holders the opportunity to vote on supporting 

new coins. Future improvements will allow token holders to choose where their share of Ethereum is 

invested. If token holders choose to have their share staked into a single currency, they only get rewards 

from that currency. Their share of the reward is based on the above formulas, but only to that specific 

currency and not all investments combined. The rewards could be higher or lower depending on multiple 

factors, including the number of Ethereum staked, and stability and growth of the coin. This feature will 

reward token holders that see potential in a supported coin by allowing them to have a greater stake in 

it.

VeriCoin VRC $0.526 914.46% 

Nexus NXS $0.821 2,596.45% 
 

New coins will be added as time goes on; and when investment voting functionality is implemented, token 

holders will be a major part of vetting potentially successful coins. 

AUTOMATION 
One of the major benefits of using MASS is our ability to automate a large portion of the process. We have 

years of experience in automation with tools like ansible on platforms such as Amazon’s AWS. Our back 

end will automate the process of reward payouts, currency exchanges, auto-balancing of investments, 

managing masternode instances, and account address verification with blockchain messages. We fully 

plan on taking suggestions and recommendations from token holders to help improve our platform.

SECURITY 
One of the most difficult parts of running a successful masternode is securing the server it runs on. MASS 

is using enterprise-grade service providers that offer DDoS protection, VLANs, and multi-factor 

authentication (MFA). On top of that is our decades of experience as high-level network and systems 

administrators. Our plan is to have the masternodes on a private network with dual failover VPNs to a 

DDoS protected public IP. Should the primary address go down, the VPN will change traffic to a new DDoS 

protected public IP so there is no downtime. 

To manage your tokens, you will be able to register an account at www.mass.cloud and attach your 

Ethereum address to it. In order to control access to your account through our site, you will have to send 

a challenge message to the blockchain. Verified addresses will be cryptographically signed in our database 

with our wallet’s private key. This ensures that no one can gain access to your account. Even in the unlikely 

event of a hack, the attackers won’t be able to properly sign the new Ethereum address. 

Along with a standard username/password, users will be asked to enter in a master passphrase or PIN 

that will only be used to burn their tokens, or to transfer tokens to another address. The purpose of this 

is to protect against unauthorized access to your accounts, even by us. This secondary passphrase/PIN will 

also be signed by our private key for another layer of security. 

ROAD MAP 
Our plans for the immediate future are investor voting and partial staking. We will create and publish new 

smart contracts that utilize these features, and will rely on the authenticity of the original contract to 

continue to control the distribution of MASS. We will adopt our framework to integrate with new coins 

and exchanges as they come online. A full-features road map will be available on our website once the 

details are locked down, and we begin to work on them. 

SUMMARY 
MASS Tokens are the first of its kind and will be the standard in how people invest in cryptocurrencies. 

MASS Tokens allow token holders the ability to stake securely in multiple currencies and masternodes 

simultaneously, while receiving block rewards automatically. Due to their unique situation, MASS Tokens 

hold twice the value of typical ERC20 tokens. Not only can they be traded on various exchanges around 

the world, but the tokens themselves lead to a large pool of funds receiving block rewards on a continuous 

basis, which will drive their value on exchanges even further.

GLOSSARY 
Ansible: An open-source automation engine that automates software provisioning, configuration 

management, and application deployment. 

APR: An annual percentage rate is the interest gained on an investment over a one year period. 

ASIC: Application-specific integrated circuit is an integrated circuit customized for a particular use, rather 

than for general-purpose use. 

Back end: Denotes a subordinate processor or program, not directly accessed by the user, which performs 

a specialized function. 

Block: Where transaction data is permanently recorded into files, like a stock transaction ledger.  Each 

block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.  Blocks are organized into a linear sequence 

over time (also known as the blockchain). 

Blockchain: A distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called 

blocks.  They are inherently resistant to modification of the data. 

Burned, burning: A function that is built into the smart contract that allows token holders to quickly 

liquidate their share of the MASS pool funds and have them converted to Ethereum and sent to them. 

Cryptocurrency: A generally decentralized virtual currency in which encryption techniques are used to 

regulate the generation of units of currency and to verify the transfer of that digital currency, operating 

independently of a central regulatory authority. 

DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which 

are often infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. 

Ecommerce: The buying and selling of goods or services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an 

electronic network (primarily the internet). 

ERC20: A token standard that describes the functions and events that an Ethereum token contract has to 

implement. 

Ethereum: An open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computer platform featuring smart 

contract (scripting) functionality, which facilitates online contractual agreements. 

Failover VPN: Virtual private network tunnels that automatically and seamlessly failover to a backup 

external interface if a failure occurs, resulting in no downtime. 

Fiat currency: Legal tender that is issued by a sovereign nation and supported in value by the full faith and 

credit of that nation. It is generally issued and regulated by the central government of that issuing nation. 

Fiat has the characteristics of being a store of value and a medium of exchange that retains value to 

purchase goods or services despite being used at a different time and in a different place from the original 

time and place of receipt. CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE NOT FIAT CURRENCY. 

Front end: The presentation layer between the user and the back end. 

Hash, hashes: The values returned by a hash function, which is any function that can be used to map data 

of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. 



14 

ICO: Initial coin offering is an as yet unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency 

venture. 

MASS: Masternode and Staking Service is an Ethereum token (ERC20) that is backed by a diverse pool of 

proof-of-stake and masternode cryptocurrencies using a smart contract that allows holders to receive 

block rewards from the pool of cryptocurrencies in the form of Ethereum. 

Masternode: Servers that facilitate certain vital network functions of a cryptocurrency that uses them. 

MFA: Multi-factor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access 

only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism. 

PoS:  Proof-of-stake is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve 

distributed consensus. The blockchain also encourages investors to accumulate and hold coins in order to 

prevent any individual or group from taking over by owning more than 50% of them. 

ROI: Return on Investment measures the amount of return on an investment relative to the investment’s 

cost. 

Sign, signed: A digital signature that is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of 

digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the 

message was created by a known sender, that the sender cannot deny having sent the message, and that 

the message was not altered in transit. 

Smart contract: Computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of 

a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. 

Stake, staked, staking:  The process of specific cryptocurrencies that reward you for holding them, more 

formally called proof-of-stake minting. For MASS, this process securely locks your tokens into a staking 

smart contract which lets you receive the block rewards from the various cryptocurrencies in Ethereum. 

Terahash: 1,000,000,000,000 hashes, usually mentioned in the context of cryptocurrency mining
