ABSTRACT

ABSTRACT
3 ИЗ 38

MiraLab was conceived as a P2P 
cryptocurrency exchanger with a simple 
and straightforward interface. The 
development of the idea was financed 
using our resources and investments from 
crypto enthusiasts. This year, the 
capitalization of cryptocurrency went up 
sharply, and the stock market volumes grew 
after it. The media picked up the topics of 
blockchain and cryptocurrency. It has 
become clear that development needs to 
be accelerated in order to take a foothold 
in the market.

Meanwhile the idea has been evolving and 
it has been transformed from a P2P 
exchanger to the full-fledged Mira 
software suite. Mira is a simple and reliable 
way to exchange, transfer and store 
cryptocurrency. We want to make the 
process of interacting with 
cryptocurrencies understandable for any 
user. Now you can simply send a file to 
purchase cryptocurrency.

Mira allows you to safely store and transfer 
cryptocurrency as well as buy it and sell it.  
Is it possible to compare Mira with wallets 
and exchanges? Because of the smart 
contract features the answer is no; but first 
things first.

OVERVIEW

OVERVIEW

MIRA ENABLES MAKING VIRTUALLY ANY TRANSACTION WITH 
CRYPTOCURRENCIES EASILY, QUICKLY AND SAFELY.

To ensure the security and high speed of transactions, and to offer the community a universal 
solution for all cryptocurrencies, we have developed the concept of the Mirabox container. 
The key feature of the Mira platform is an encrypted file containing cryptocurrency1 
(for example, in the case of bitcoin, a private key). To open MiraBox, you must meet certain 
conditions as well as know your password. MiraBox is associated with the relevant contract 
on the MiraNet blockchain, so that the service can control the opening and identify the 
information.

We are developing three types of MiraBox containers: NominalBox, MultiBox, and SmartBox
– each with different functional features:

We are staging the ICO to finance the development of the Mira software suite.  The hard cap 
of the project is US$20 MILLION. 30.77 MILLION MIRA TOKENS will be issued in total; 

78% OF THE TOKENS WILL BE OFFERED TO THE COMMUNITY DURING THE ICO. 

The MIRA token is an infrastructure token that will be used to pay MIRA fees for transactions 
using MultiBox and SmartBox. Between 25% and 35% of the tokens that are accepted as 
payment will be burnt. Most of the remaining tokens will accumulate on the Mira account and 
will not be sold on the market. Some Mira services will be paid for in fiat currency; this will 
allow us to fund the operational costs of the platform. Thus, with the growth of the platform's 
turnover, the total demand for the MIRA token will always be greater than the sum of the 
supply.

1Technically MiraBox does not contain cryptocurrency, the container only encrypts a public and private key.
For a user, however, this means that b itcoin (or other cryptocurrency) is in their wallet. 

NOMINALBOX is a container with one type of cryptocurrency.

MULTIBOX  is a container with an arbitrary number of different supported cryptocurrencies.

SMARTBOX is a MultiBox with additional functionality.

The Mira software suite supports MiraBox containers and their transactions and transfer 
operations. The suite consists of four key elements:

MIRALAB.IO 
MIRAWALLET for PC 
MIRAWALLET MOBILE 
MIRANET

MIRA token holders can perform the roles of node, smart contract designer and/or arbitrator, 
and receive additional rewards in MIRA tokens.

Even an experienced computer user will need several hours or days to understand the issues. 
What if there is no desire or time to go into the details? Let's take a look at the most popular 
means of storing and exchanging cryptocurrencies using the example of b itcoin. 

ICO PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE:
   100 FREE MIRABOXES TO EACH ICO PARTICIPANT
   who bought MIRA tokens for a sum exceeding US$5,000.

  500 FREE MIRABOXES TO EACH ICO PARTICIPANT 
 who bought MIRA tokens for a sum exceeding US$100,000.

   20 % DISCOUNT ON THE PURCHASE OF MULTIBOX AND
SMARTBOX TO ALL ICO PARTICIPANTS
the discount will be in effect for 12 months after the launch of Mira v 1.0.

MARKET ISSUES

It's no secret how quickly cryptocurrencies are entering the lives of ordinary people. Bitcoin is 
discussed in the papers, on TV, and people who are far from the IT market talk about its costs 
during lunch. However, knowing and being able to use it are not the same, however; and with 
all the popularity of cryptocurrency and blockchain, even now to pay for something with for 
example bi tcoin, a person needs to deal with a number of technical questions:

How does it work

How to get a wallet

How to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrency

How to store: online wallet, offline or exchange

How to protect money from theft

How to send it

OFFLINE WALLETS
6 ИЗ 38

OFFLINE WALLETS

ONLINE WALLETS

Advanced users prefer offline wallets. These wallets download a complete copy of a 
blockchain and act as peer nodes to support the network. The most common option is Bitcoin 
Core. It provides maximum security, but has a number of drawbacks:

HAS SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF A PC.

THE BITCOIN CORE CLIENT OCCUPIES MORE THAN 100GB (WHEN FULLY 
DOWNLOADED),  so the user will need plenty of free hard drive space.

IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME TO SYNCHRONIZE A WALLET.

Some of the disadvantages of offline wallets are solved by online wallets. You just have to 
install an application, for example, on a smartphone, and then you can access your assets from 
anywhere. Online wallets typically have a kind of friendly interface, so it's easy to understand 
their functionality.

Nevertheless, online wallets have one key drawback: they are centralized, which means they 
are susceptible to hacking, fraudulent operations, government regulation and so on. In fact, 
cryptocurrency stored in online wallets is not fully owned by the user, and the larger amount
in the account, the more acute the problem.

There is another issue that is common to online and offline wallets — the speed of 
transactions. All wallets transfer cryptocurrency through the blockchain, which means you 
have to wait for transactions to be confirmed. 

EXCHANGES
The benefits of exchanges are clear - above all, they offer liquidity and a wide range of tools. 
However, the problem may be that there is no guarantee of repayment to users if the exchange 
(even with a good reputation) bursts, is exposed to a hacking attack or its owner (often 
anonymous) leaves with customers' money. As with online wallets, the money on the exchange 
do not belong to the user.

Cryptocurrencies do not have the status of securities in any country in the world, so it is not 
possible to return them within the legal framework. Thus, the security of assets cannot be 
controlled by their owner.

SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES

SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES
7 ИЗ 38

The shortcomings outlined above have led us to believe that the market needs a 
fundamentally new way of storing and using cryptocurrency that is understandable to any user. 
So we are working on the Mira software suite. 

Mira facilitates interaction with 
cryptocurrencies. To ensure the security 
and high speed of transactions, and to offer 
the community a universal solution for all 
cryptocurrencies, we have developed the 
concept of the Mirabox container. MiraBox 
is an encrypted file containing 
cryptocurrency1. To open MiraBox, you 
must meet certain conditions as well as 
know the password.

MIRABOX IS SUPPORTED BY THE MIRA 
SOFTWARE SUITE:

MIRALAB.IO – online service for 
MiraBox;

MIRAWALLET for PC – desktop 
application for working with MiraBox. 
MiraWallet has an open source code 
that will be posted on GitHub, which 
will allow you to open MiraBox even 
if miralab.io is unavailable;

MIRAWALLET MOBILE –
smartphone application for iOS and 
Android;

MIRANET — Ethereum-based Mira 
blockchain. 

UNIQUE ADVANTAGES
OF MIRABOX:  

EASE OF USE
It is easy to transfer and store because it is 
a regular file that can be transferred outside 
of blockchain.

SECURITY
You can open the content only by knowing 
the password and meeting the smart 
contract conditions that can be added to 
MiraBox.

TRANSPARENCY
An open MiraBox can be loaded into 
MiraLab or MiraWallet and you can find out 
exactly what is inside. Key data is stored on 
the MiraNet blockchain. If you do not have 
a password or if you do not comply with 
smart contract conditions, you will not be 
able to access the content.

ANONYMITY
MiraBox does not contain data about its 
creator and can be opened anywhere in the 
world. To buy or sell cryptocurrency 
packaged in MiraBox, you don't have to 
create an account or wallet. And if you use 
a private MiraBox, the content will be 
completely hidden.

1  Technically MiraBox does not contain cryptocurrency, the container only encrypts public and private key. For a user, however, 
 this means that b itcoin (or other cryptocurrency) is in their wallet.

FAULTTOLERANCE
If the miralab.io domain is unavailable, you 
can open MiraBox in the desktop or 
mobile version of the MiraWallet 
application. MiraWallet will always be 
available for download on GitHub. 

OPENNESS   
All the software has open source code that 
will be posted on GitHub.

CUSTOM SMART
CONTRACTS
The possibility of adding MiraBox opening 
conditions according to a user's unique 
specifications (for example, not earlier than 
a specified date or after confirmation from 
a third party).

ACCORDING TO THEIR FUNCTIONS WE DISTINGUISH
THREE KINDS OF MIRABOX:

NOMINALBOX – MiraBox, which can contain only one kind of cryptocurrency. The 
NominalBox is the easiest and cheapest way to buy cryptocurrency.

MULTIBOX is MiraBox with arbitrary content. MultiBox can contain one or more kinds 
of cryptocurrencies. Also in MultiBox, you can add any document up to 25MB.

SMARTBOX is MultiBox with an integrated smart contract. A smart contract is a 
restriction on opening SmartBox content until predetermined external conditions are 
met.

! THE BEST WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND HOW YOUR PRODUCT WORKS
IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE USED IN REAL LIFE. LET'S LOOK AT SOME
EXAMPLES OF HOW THE MIRA SOFTWARE SUITE IS APPLIED IN REAL LIFE.

THIS FILE CAN BE KEPT ON YOUR COMPUTER, SENT BY MAIL,
OR SAVED ON A FLASH CARD.

The other day, tcoin on the television and became 
interested. He asked his co-workers, talked to his supervisor on the topic. Everybody has heard 
about b itcoin before, but nobody knows any details.

From the conversations, he realizes that cryptocurrencies are growing in price (which means 
it's going to be good for a rainy day or in older age) and that they don't physically exist (and so 
the wife won't find the stash). JOHN WOULD LIKE TO INVEST $500 IN BITCOIN, BUT HE'S 
NOT READY TO WORK THROUGH ALL THE DETAILS.

John visits the miralab.io website, enters the dollar amount for which he would like to buy 
cryptocurrency. 1 b itcoin on the exchanges stands at $6,000, so for $500 the service offers 
John the opportunity to buy NominalBox with 0.083 BTC. John chooses a convenient method 
of payment, and miralab.io generates a link to download the NominalBox file and the 
password.

If John (or someone else) wants to unpack the file and access its contents, it will suffice to 
download it to the miralab.io service (or MiraWallet program) and specify the crypto wallet to 
which 0.083 BTC will be sent from NominalBox. If John wants to sell b itcoin, he can do it 
without unpacking NominalBox:
MIRA GUARANTEES BUYING MIRABOX FOR 99% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF 
CRYPTOCURRENCY.

Hank is an advanced man who has a passion for cryptocurrencies, blockchain, iPhones, and all 
things modern. He wants to be paid only in bitcoin for his services.

Hank knows that the easiest way to buy and send bi tcoins is Mira. Hank recommends Mira to 
James. James visits miralab.io, buys a NominalBox (with a predetermined amount as for John 
from the previous example) with his credit card; without even downloading the file he 
specifies the recipient's e-mail, and sends the file.

Hank opens the e-mail on his computer and downloads the file to MiraWallet for PC, checking 
the value of the NominalBox sent to him. And if Hank is on the road, he can open the file on 
his smartphone, downloading it to MiraWallet Mobile or miralab.io.

Middle-level manager Eddie wants to save cryptocurrency for his 13-year-old son to be able to 
buy an apartment in London and a car when he reaches the legal age. However, Eddie doesn't 
know what cryptocurrency is going to grow in price during this period, and he'd rather diversify 
his portfolio.

Eddie visits miralab.io and creates a MultiBox that "packages" 2 BTC and 30 ETH.

If he has enough BTC and ETH, he can package it into a SmartBox using the miralab.io or 
MiraWallet Mobile functionality. If he doesn't have the right number of bitcoins, he can buy 
them on miralab.io, as in the previous examples with NominalBox.

After Eddie gives the file and password to his son, he can download it to the service and see 
the content. His son will also be able to upload the file back to miralab.io and sell the BTC and 
ETH in it for 99% of the nominal value or "unpack" them and sell it on a cryptocurrency 
exchange at the exchange price. The money received, unlike an apartment and a car in London 
in a few years, can be spent right now on a new gaming computer and a bicycle.

The objective is supplemented by a condition: Buy BTC, ETH (and other cryptocurrency of 
choice) and ensure their integrity over the next five years.

Eddie visits the miralab.io and creates a MultiBox that "packages" 2 BTC and 30 ETH. Eddie 
also specifies the smart contract condition:

After Eddie gives the file to his son, he can download it to the service, see the content and

As you know, the two main enemies of any trader are fear and greed. Nick, the nervous trader, 
trading altcoins understands this, and if he starts to lose, he loses his head. Anger and irritation 
provoke failures and unfounded solutions.

For Nick, it's most important to stick to the original plan and not to lose more money than he 
can afford. He sends altcoins to SmartBox with a condition that it can be opened in seven 
days.

At the same time, he concedes that the course of events may change unexpectedly and that 
the funds will be needed before the 7 day period ends. Therefore, Nick adds one more 
condition:

Nick saves the file on the desktop and calmly, with a cold mind starts to trade.

TYPES OF MIRABOX CONTAINERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS: NOMINALBOX 
14 ИЗ 38 14

NOMINALBOX

TYPES OF MIRABOX CONTAINERS
AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

As mentioned above, we distinguish three 
types of MiraBoxes according to their 
functions:

NOMINALBOX — a MiraBox container 
which can contain only one kind of 
cryptocurrency. Buying a NominalBox is 
the easiest and cheapest way to buy 
cryptocurrency for fiat. The user only has 
to choose the cryptocurrency they want to 
buy in the NominalBox container and its 
amount. All the rest will be done by Mira 
itself. 

NominalBox is similar to BTC-e (WEX) 
codes, but in contrast, the coins are not 
centralized (but contained in the MiraBox), 
and therefore do not depend on any 
service capacity.

A user can choose to buy a NominalBox 
with a certain predetermined value inside 
(for example, 0.1 ETH, 0.05 BTC, 0.1 ETC) 
or any value of their own choosing. In the 
first case, the transaction is performed 
instantaneously - the user receives a 
MiraBox that was previously created on 
Mira. In the second case, the transaction is 
completed after the network confirms it.

The acquisition of a NominalBox does not 
require the verification and authorization 
of the user. The most popular payment 
tools in Europe will be accepted. 

! IMPORTANT TO NOTE:
We provide the broadest possible
list of NominalBox with
predetermined values in order to
speed up transactions within Mira.
To this end, a reserve fund will be
established in cryptocurrency and
fiat to ensure the necessary level
of liquidity for the Mira system.

MULTIBOX
SMARTBOX



TYPES OF MIRABOX CONTAINERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS: MULTIBOX 
15 ИЗ 38 15

 

NominalBox is not only the simplest and fastest, but also the cheapest way to buy 
cryptocurrency for fiat. The user pays for cryptocurrency in fiat at the current exchange rate + 
Stock Commission and Commission for transferring cryptocurrency + Mira Commission. 
However, the Mira Commission is minimal; it is only 0.05% of the transaction amount. This 
revenue allows us to fund the further development and maintenance of the platform's 
operational capability. Thus, in essence, NominalBox allows for the purchase of 
cryptocurrency almost at cost (the user would still pay stock fees on the stock market).

EXAMPLE:
with 0 .5 BTC for euros. EUR/USD rate at the time of the transaction is 1.15.

(($6,000*0.5)*(1+0.5%)/1.15)*(1+0.05%) = 2,623.05 EUR 

! The exchange price of 1 BTC is $6,000. The user buys NominalBox

Let the exchange fees be 0.5% of the transaction volume. The value of the selected
NominalBox in the user's currency is then calculated according to the formula:

MULTIBOX 
MULTIBOX is a MiraBox that can contain one or more kinds of cryptocurrency. Also in MultiBox,
you can add any document up to 25MB. 

When a user creates a MultiBox, via a user-friendly interface he selects the kind of content 
that will be placed in the MiraBox: BTC, ETH, etc. Then Mira does everything on its own: 
provides the purchase and packaging of the selected cryptocurrency in the MultiBox, and the 
private key is placed in the closed part of the MiraBox. In this way, you can quickly purchase 
several types of cryptocurrency or create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio that 
guarantees secure storage for the MultiBox.

To purchase a MultiBox, you must undergo a registration procedure at miralab.io.Our 
platform will calculate the value of the selected volume of cryptocurrency by the same 
principle as for the NominalBox. The difference is that the Mira Commission will be paid for 
in MIRA token instead of fiat. The user can pay the fee to Mira with independently purchased 
Mira tokens (on an exchange or during the ICO), or purchase a MIRA token on miralab.io at a 
rate corresponding to the best bid price. The platform will calculate how many MIRA tokens 
must be purchased to pay the commission, and will calculate the cost in fiat to the transaction 
amount. Thus, the process of buying a MultiBox for a user will not be more complicated than 
buying a NominalBox, and he won't even notice which transaction was made. The Mira 
Commission for the sale of the MultiBox is 0.3% of the transaction amount.

TYPES OF MIRABOX CONTAINERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS: SMARTBOX 
16 ИЗ 38

SMARTBOX 

SMARTBOX FEATURES IN THE FIRST VERSION:

CAN ONLY BE OPENED AFTER A CERTAIN DATE AND TIME
(for example, not before 12/31/2020, 00:00)

ONLY THE RECIPIENT CAN OPEN
(you will need confirmation via e-mail, Telegram, or/and phone)

!

SMARTBOX  is a MultiBox with an integrated smart contract. A smart contract receives information
from oracles that can restrict the opening of the SmartBox content until certain external conditions
are met or reached.  

YOU CAN OPEN IF THE RATE FOR ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY IS GREATER
THAN OR LESS THAN A CERTAIN VALUE

To avoid situations in which the specified opening conditions may never be met, when you 
create a SmartBox the date is optional, and you can uncompress the box without having to 
unpack it.

Thus, the functionality of the Mira platform allows the open SmartBox holder to always see 
its contents, but he will only be able to uncover it if the smart contract condition is met. This 
allows you to use the SmartBox to pay for any services that must be performed at a specific 
time or when certain conditions are reached. 

SmartBox purchase is similar to buying a MultiBox. To implement it, you must complete a 
registration process on miralab.io and, through the platform interface, select one or more of 
the available smart contract terms.

In future versions of Mira, the list of smart contract offers to be selected will be expanded, and 
a smart contract designer will be implemented, in which token holders can design smart 
contracts themselves and receive part of Mira's fee in payment for their work.

The Mira Commission for the sale of a SmartBox is 1.50% of the transaction amount and is 
paid in MIRA tokens on the same basis as the MultiBox.

Mira guarantees the delivery of cryptocurrency to create the MultiBox and SmartBox 
according to the most advantageous conditions for the user. The fee is charged only for 
packing cryptocurrency in the MiraBox. Thus, it is not necessary for the user to purchase 
cryptocurrency, he may add cryptocurrency to the MultiBox or SmartBox by paying only
a service fee (0.30% OR 1.50%, RESPECTIVELY).

https://miralab.io/


17
TYPES OF MIRABOX CONTAINERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS: SMARTBOX 
17 ИЗ 38

Apart from dividing the MiraBoxes by functionality, we divide them by privacy:
OPEN MIRABOX AND PRIVATE MIRABOX. 

OPEN MIRABOX is a container which contents will be transparent to the owner of the file. 
He can download it to miralab.io or the MiraWallet PC/MiraWallet Mobile application and 
see what's inside: denomination, type, and amount of cryptocurrency.

If, for example, this is a MultiBox with bitcoin and ether, the user will be able to see the 
addresses where these tokens will be stored. Private keys will be stored in the container's 
private content, which will only be available when the container is password-open. The 
container can only be opened once, and Mira will always know if the container was previously 
opened.

PRIVATE MIRABOX is an entirely anonymous container; the MiraNet blockchain has no 
information except when the unpacking status and the box ID are included in the block. In a 
private MiraBox, all information is encrypted and becomes unrecognizable for both user and 
the Mira system. What Mira knows is the status of this container's unpacking. Only the 
creator knows about the content of this MIRABOX, and it is as anonymous as Mr. Satoshi 
Nakamato himself.

Reverse buy of the NominalBox from a user: Any user can unpack the contents of the 
container and sell the tokens on an exchange or P2P exchanger. Mira guarantees the sale 
of the container for 99% of the market value of the total cryptocurrency.

Miralab.io does not store passwords from MiraBox, so it is not possible to open it centrally in 
any way.  

In Mira v 1.0, MiraBox will support several major cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, BCC, ETH and 
the packaging of an arbitrary file. This file can be, for example, a postcard to a gifted value or a 
deal. The file can be added to the MultiBox and SmartBox, and its weight is limited to 25MB.

Later versions of Mira plan to extend the cryptocurrency list and functionality.  

MIRAWALLET FOR PC

PC MIRAWALLET FEATURES:
Unpacking MiraBox.

Create and sell MultiBox or SmartBox 
when you interact with miralab.io.

Displays the balance/count of content in 
MiraBox: in the MiraWallet settings, 
you can select a working folder to which 
the user can save MiraBox. MiraWallet 
will scan this folder and display "balance" 
to the user of the account, that is the number of coins of each view as a total of MiraBox. 
This makes the program seem like a wallet because the overall balance will be visible as 
well as the balance of each coin separately. MiraWallet can only count the contents of 
open MiraBoxes. Private MiraBoxes will remain private.

Split and merge MiraBox: this feature is designed to merge MiraBox or split one MiraBox 
into multiples. Let's say a user has a MiraBox containing 1 ETH and he needs to send 
someone 0.2 ETH. You can load MiraBox into the service and select the Split function. 
The application will create two new MiraBoxes: in one of them, Mira would pack a

user-specified portion of the coins, and the rest of the coins would be retained with the 
original password. Alternatively, there are two MiraBoxes, and their contents need to be 
merged into one. You can download both MiraBoxes to the program and select the 
function to merge them. These operations are free for the user, and the only fee that is 
charged is paid when boxing is purchased.

Connect Cloud storage: The user will be able to connect to the program personal cloud 
storage from the list of available MiraBox backup copies. In principle, you can do this 
externally to the program (just by synchronizing the desired folder across the cloud), but 
the feature will be particularly useful, when using the Mira Wallet Mobile application.

MIRA SOFTWARE SUITE V 1.0: MIRANET
22 ИЗ 38 22

MIRANET

MIRANET — the Mira Blockchain is implemented on the Ethereum basis, that is it includes all 
of its own functions including the creation/execution of smart contracts and interaction with 
them. The MiraNet Blockchain will be based on nodes which are the backbone of the network, 
provide a stable network, perform a variety of service functions (for example, guaranteeing the 
security and timely issuance of a key from the internal content of the MiraBox during 
unpacking).

During the first 6-12 months prior to the launch of the second version of Mira, the GBRs role 
will be performed by the Mira servers. You will then enter third-party nodes.

A node can be run by any owner of MIRA token who packed 3,000 MIRA tokens into a special 
MiraBox loaded onto the service. The remuneration for nodes will be based on 10% of Mira 
revenue nominated in MIRA tokens and distributed equally among nodes. We believe that the 
possibility to take the role of node to participate in revenue distribution for the project will 
spur demand for MIRA tokens and will increase its exchange rate value. For more information 
about Mira revenue, see the chapter "The Economy of Mira".   



THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOFTWARE SUITE MIRA V 2.0
23 ИЗ 38 23

THE EVOLUTION OF THE
SOFTWARE SUITE MIRA V 2.0

The second version of the service will be an extended and expanded Mira v 1.0 feature. The 
platform and the software suite will become more user-friendly and functional.

Now MiraLab and MiraWallet can be used as ordinary cryptocurrency wallets, and user 
cryptocurrency will be stored in files (and/or personal cloud storage) and will remain protected 
by user passwords; this means that you will not be able to service in the event of an attack.

In Mira v , most of the tokens popular at the time of the launch will be added. The 
number will continue to increase following market development.

Work on Mira v 2.0 will begin even before the completion of Mira v 1.0 and culminate in 
August 2019. 

NEW FEATURES OF MIRALAB.IO

Functions are useful for sending and receiving cryptocurrency, similar to wallets.

Integration with popular exchanges and online wallets. You can now save tokens to a 
MiraBox in multiple clicks. Similarly, you can send funds to an exchange by selecting the 
appropriate MiraBox, or automatically after choosing one.

Creates a MiraBox with conditions for opening. As designer, you can now create entire sets 
of conditions for opening.

Different types of authorization, including Google Authenticator, SMS, Telegram, etc.

Mira can count the balance in a account by summing up all the MiraBox in a user's cloud.

Integration with Telegram accounts: in Telegram Cloud, you can save MiraBox to send to 
IMS users.

The smart-contract capabilities used in the SmartBox are enhanced.

Cooperative creation of MiraBox. In a service, you can select the cooperative creation of 
MiraBox. You create a MultiBox or NominalBox that is open to make deposits for a 
specific time or amount. When the time elapses or the required amount is reached, the 
MiraBox is packed, with specified opening conditions.

ersion v 2.0

https://miralab.io/


Such a function may be useful, for example, for charitable purposes. A MiraBox is created; 
the recipient and the fee amount are specified. Once filled, MiraBox is guaranteed to be 
able to be opened only by the correct recipient.

NEW MIRAWALLET FOR PC FEATURES
All functions from miralab.io;

Authorization in an application using Google Authenticator, SMS, and Telegram.

MIRAWALLET MOBILE FEATURES
MiraWallet Mobile will work similarly to wallet apps and online banking.

All features from miralab.io, including the SmartBox visual designer, will be added.

A service will be developed to send MiraBox to contacts from a phone book.

NEW FEATURES OF MIRABOX
MIRABOX CAN ONLY BE OPENED AFTER CONFIRMATION FROM A THIRD PARTY
(one or more persons), so-called "arbitrators". However, you will be able to set the 
percentage of evidence required to open a MiraBox: all arbitrators must confirm the deal, or 
more than half, or a certain percentage. Packaging the document in MiraBox first version and 
introducing arbitration into the second is a step towards the introduction of the MiraGarant 
service in later releases.

MIRABOX WITH "DOUBLE BOTTOM"
These MiraBoxes will provide two levels of protection by creating internal hidden content 
with a second password that cannot be accessed with a basic password. Moreover, only the 
owner of the MiraBox will know about the hidden content. In the first, closed part of 
MiraBox, a small amount of money, insignificant document or photo, may be placed. So, in 
the case of opening of a MiraBox by an intruder, they'll think there is nothing valuable 
except this picture. Install the master password on all the MiraBoxes of the same owner.

MIRA V 3.0. SMARTBOX LABORATORY
AND PLATFORM FOR THIRDPARTY
DEVELOPERS 

The opening conditions that you specify, when you create a SmartBox are essentially a visual 
designer of smart contracts, where you can enter data about external events (currency change, 
timing, and conditions).

The MiraBox will package the code that will execute when the MiraBox is opened and given 
access to the MiraNet blockchain. You can publish code to the blockchain only to resolve 
conflicts when a dispute occurs.

At time of design,it is extremely diff icult to consider all possible ways of using MiraBox, and 
centralized development may not be flexible enough to meet all the demands and 
requirements of the market. We cannot predict which market demands and technological 
innovations will open new features of a SmartBox. Therefore, building on Mira we are 
planning to create a third-party platform that will allow you to create additional services using 
the SmartBox. This will resemble CMS plug-ins, when each new add-on adds functionality to 
the current service.

The platform and strict code standards will be developed. Each add-on will only be added to 
the system after a thorough review by MiraLab, and a test period of use. All third-party 
add-ons will have open source code.

We called this the "SMART CONTRACT LABORATORY" service.

MiraBoxes somewhat resembles regular bills; you can calculate them, or you can save them. 
Therefore, such MiraBox can find applications wherever they are passed to cryptocurrency, but 
conditions for opening are added. For example, prizes in competitions, shares, charitable 
donations, rates, etc. Developers will be able to earn a percentage of the income from a 
SmartBox..

The main update in Mira v 4.0 will be the MiraGarant service. Based on MiraBox functions 
and the platform for developers, there is a great opportunity to create a warranty service. Let's 
say two people want to make some kind of deal. To do so, they:

fulfilled, the arbitrator shall be called by Mira. The arbitrator is a certified MIRA 
tokenholder.

Open MiraBox content includes metadata on the MiraBox contents, including addresses of 
wallets where the funds are kept. This ensures that a stated amount of currency is present in 
MiraBox. Encrypted contents contain the private key for opening MiraBox.

In order to decrypt the content, the program needs a password consisting of 2 parts: the 
password (generated in the user's browser when creating or buying MiraBox) and the key (to 
open the encrypted content, this is stored on the MiraNet nodes and is sent to the program 
when a user wants to unpack the container). 

SCHEME OF WORK

1. Sending MiraBox to an unpacking application.

2. Entering the password.

3. Sending a request to open MiraBox.

4. Confirming the password.

5. Sending permission to open MiraBox (from the technical point of view this is the transfer of 
the second part of the encryption from the node to the contract, after the encryption is  
validated, MiraBox opening is initiated). 

ALL CONTENTS OF THE PRIVATE MIRABOX ARE ENCRYPTED.

SECURITY

SECURITY
30 ИЗ 38 30

We pay maximum attention to the safety of the user's assets. This is one of our key 
advantages. Security is provided using the following methods:

1. A MULTISIGNATURE MECHANISM
In order to open MiraBox with cryptocurrency, it is necessary to pass MULTISIG verification. 
This means that more than one ECDSA signature is required to complete the transaction. 
Thus, no one member of the system can access the funds unilaterally. After opening, the 
MiraBox is marked as open and cannot be used again in Mira.

2. DOUBLEENCRYPTION OF THE MIRABOX FILE
When a MiraBox is created through MiraWallet, its contents are encrypted with the symmetric 
algorithm AES-256. If the user creates a MultiBox, an encryption is added using asymmetric 
ECC (Elliptic-curve cryptography).

3. ORACLES
A distributed system of predicting offchain events, built on the same principle as the Oraclize 
and ChainLink services. That is, events are verified by a number of independent servers that 
have a rating system that is based on which PoS confirms the prediction of a particular oracle. 



ICO

By developing Mira, we are trying to create a service that will be useful and required both for 
newcomers to the crypto market and for the existing community. So in 2017, when it became 
clear to us that additional funding would be needed to implement our platform-wide 
functionality, we decided to offer it to the whole community instead of a limited list of 
venture funds. Participating in the Mira ICO, the community will participate in the future 
growth of a project which is also designed for their own needs. 

ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS, THE COST OF DEVELOPING
THE MIRA SOFTWARE SUITE IS $13 MILLION AND

IS DISTRIBUTED AS FOLLOWS:  

In addition, we understand that ' from one of the examples above will not
about Mira's serviknow ces if we do not allocate marketing expenses. For John to be able to buy 

bitcoin in a container without fear of money transfers, we will need legal escort. And we will 
also need to finance a reserve fund in both fiat currency and MIRA token. We estimate the 
total hard cap of the project at $20 million.

An open MIRA token sale will take place in 2 stages. During the pre-ICO, the value of 1 MIRA 
token will be equal to $0.6. In the main ICO period, the value of 1 MIRA token will be from 
$0.7 to $1.0.

The share for the team will be frozen until Mira v 1.0 is complete. Then 75% of this share will 
be packed into a specially created SmartBox, whose smart contract conditions will be phased 
out as new versions of Mira are started. The share for advisors will not be frozen and will not 
exceed 20% of the team's share.  

ECONOMY OF MIRA

65% of the resources attracted by the ICO are planned to be spent on product 
development. About 30% of this amount will be spent on purchasing the necessary 
equipment, and 70% on the work of our internal team and third-party developers.

10% of the funds attracted are for legal services. We understand that regulation of the 
cryptocurrency market can change very quickly and in diametrically opposed directions 
depending on jurisdiction. Therefore, decisions will be taken by engaging experienced 
lawyers in the most pro-crypto industry countries at the time.

8% of the funds attracted are for the cost of active marketing in the first three years
of the platform.

10% of the funds attracted are for the reserve fund in fiat currency required
to maintain liquidity within the system.

The basis of the Mira financial model lies in the forecast of the total turnover of 
cryptocurrency. We are confident that the volume of trade in cryptocurrency will grow rapidly 
and expects that the average quarterly growth of BTC and ETH to the end of 2019 would be 10 
percent and in the period 2020-2021 GG. - 5 percent.

According to our calculations based on Coin Dance's (https://coin.dance) statistics, the P2P 
share of transactions currently stands at about 3% of the total stock turnover of 
cryptocurrencies. We believe that the popularity of P2P with regard to stock turnover will 
grow, as this is the easiest way to buy cryptocurrency currently. According to our expectations, 
the P2P share will reach 6% of the stock turnover by 2021.

P2P exchangers such as Localbitcoins, paxful, etc. we consider our key competitors. The users 
of these platforms are our target audience. We believe that the high quality of Mira's services, 
together with the low commission and marketing strategy, will enable us to take 20 percent of 
the P2P market share by the end of 2020.

ECONOMY OF MIRA
35 ИЗ 38 35

The problem with most utility tokens is that documentation focuses on infrastructural 
demand for tokens, ignoring the risks of infrastructural supply. Any token used as a payment 
instrument for a service will be sold on the market by the service provider (platform) because 
the operator needs to finance the transaction costs that are denominated in fiat currency. Thus, 
infrastructure demand will be balanced by an infrastructure supply, which will not allow the 
token to grow in price.This is why Mira diversified its revenue: we gain profits both in fiat and 
 in MIRA tokens. 

According to our financial plan, by 2020, more than 70% of our operating costs will be covered 
by income from fiat, and by 2021 all transaction costs will be covered by fiat income. This 
means that from 2021, Mira will not be able to sell MIRA tokens, which were received as a 
transaction fee, and until then sell a small portion of the revenue received by the MIRA token. 
In the Mira balance, the undistributed profit nominated in MIRA token, will be the result of a 
positive revaluation which will lead to an increase in fiat currency value of business profits.

MIRA’S PROFIT & LOSS



THREE REASONS TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE MIRA TOKEN ICO 

1. WE HAVE A PROFITABLE AND PRUDENT FINANCIAL MODEL:
As early as 2020, 70% of operational costs will be financed by fiat income. 

Over 60% of total earnings will be denominated in MIRA tokens by 2020.

During next 2018-2019 we will liquidate 25% of MIRA tokens that we will receive as 
revenue. In 2020, the repayment rate for tokens will increase to 35%, and from 2021 
– up to 45%:

Most often, utility token models only assume that infrastructural demand is calculated to 
finance the project services. Our financial model takes into account not only the demand, but 
also the proposal, which will always arise, because projects need to finance their own costs, 
most often nominated in fiat currency.

Because we are burning tokens and diversifying the currency of our income, starting in 2020, 
the infrastructure demand will exceed 2.8 times the offer.

THREE REASONS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MIRA TOKEN ICO 
36 ИЗ 38 36

1The coefficient shows how many of the MIRA tokens used for paying for MIRA fees will be burned. For example, suppose the 
revenue in MIRA token for 2019 was $943.2 thousand, and the combustion coefficient in 2019, 25% would be burned - the 
equivalent of $235,800.

2The calculations are made using the nominal MIRA token price (1 MIRA = 1 USD). 
The actual result is likely to be different because MIRA token price will be variable. 



TO CONCLUDE
We will not create a revolution, we will not change the world, we do not promise subversive 
innovations, and we do not collect tens of millions for God knows what.
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE A USERFRIENDLY PRODUCT THAT WE WILL USE 
OURSELVES AND THAT WILL BE USED BY THE CRYPTO COMMUNITY.

TO CONCLUDE
37 ИЗ 38 37

3. TOKEN OWNERS ARE GRANTED THE RIGHT TO PERFORM SERVICES FOR THE
PLATFORM:

NODE: any holder of 3,000 MIRA token can be a node. The total compensation of the 
GBRS will be 10% of the Mira income nominated in MIRA token. We believe that this 
can support the demand for MIRA token in the secondary market as the project's 
income grows. 

SMART  CONTRACT DESIGNER: SmartBox developers will be paid 50% of the
Mira fee charged in MIRA tokens. 

ARBITRATOR: arbitrators are paid 2 percent of the value of the disputed assets at the 
date of settlement of the dispute. 

2. TO ICO PARTICIPANTS WE OFFER ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES:

100 free MiraBoxes to each ICO participant, who bought MIRA tokens for a sum 
exceeding US$5,000.

500 free MiraBoxes to each ICO participant who bought MIRA tokens for a sum 
exceeding US$100,000.

20% discount on the purchase of the MultiBox and SmartBox to all ICO participants. 
The discount will be in effect for 12 months after the launch of Mira v 1.0.
