Introduction

Climate change poses a major risk to the global 
economy, affecting the wealth and prosperity of all 
citizens and nations around the world. It will have 
significant impact on resource availability, energy 
pricing, infrastructure vulnerability and company 
valuations.

Corporate environmental sustainability efforts are 
no longer considered purely voluntary. Customers 
and shareholders alike now expect meaningful 
energy and emissions reductions, whilst legislators 
at every level are creating new regulations that 
require proof of compliance of climate change 
adaptation. 

The untapped and undervalued Natural Capital 
asset class is estimated to be worth in excess of USD 
$120 trillion, while specific assets represented by 
institutions and individuals committed to some 
sort of divestment from fossil fuels is estimated to 
reach $5 trillion in 2017.

While awareness and legislation regarding climate 
change and the critical importance of Natural 
Assets grows, there is as yet no transparent 
mechanism to connect producers of these Natural 
Assets with the buyers and consumers of those 
assets. 

Today, as is the case with many industries, control 
and the resultant benefits reside with a privileged 
few. 

The Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform 
and EARTH Token cryptocurrency provides a 
unique opportunity to truly transform the Natural 

Capital Asset market, by creating a Natural Asset 
Marketplace that allows all stakeholders in the 
climate value chain to participate. 

Stakeholders will also be able to package assets with 
value added services to create customized offerings 
catering to new market segments, expanding the 
overall market and creating additional wealth for all 
participants.

As a prov ider o f innovat ive env i ronmenta l 
sustainability solutions since 2009, we understand 
the immense value of this new platform and 
paradigm. We already offer a unique range of 
existing solutions that create demand for Natural 
Capital Assets, underpinned by a proven business 
models, with existing, paying clients.

Climate change adaptation requires our collective, 
and urgent in te r vent ion ,  to ensure f u ture 
generations are left with a sustainable planet.

It is a rare opportunity to create significant wealth by 
doing the right thing. 

EARTH Token and the Natural Asset Exchange 
blockchain platform described herein is based on 
the premise that impactChoice will raise capital via 
crowdfunding.

We look forward to you joining our community to 
make a difference and realise the benefits of this 
enormous market opportunity.

Unlocking an undervalued Asset Class

Blockchains are clearly changing the world.

Pick almost any industry and you can observe how 
blockchain technology has the potential to cause 
disruptive change. 

Consider project financing, where bankers, private 
equity, venture capital and selected individuals have 
for far too long controlled most of the capital, and the 
resultant profits that flow from investments in 
projects.

Blockchains carry the promise of a more inclusive and 

universally accessible world, a world in which 
community participants and common folk get an 
equal opportunity to participate, and share, in the 
value that they create.

Natural Capital is the world's stock of natural 
resources. The untapped and undervalued. Natural 
Capital asset class is estimated to be worth in excess of 
USD $120 trillion, yet no transparent mechanism 
exists to connect producers of Natural Assets with 
business, consumers, or IoT devices.

Establishment of the Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform 

with EARTH Token as the settlement mechanism currency will:

Provide a free, open, 
transparent and 

universally accessible 
platform connecting 
producers of Natural 

Assets with buyers

Eliminate fraud and 
double counting of 

Natural Assets

Provide sellers with

The Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform will 
enable certified Natural Capital Asset project 
developers to list their products (e.g. carbon credits, 
REC's, metered output, etc.), on a unique Blockchain 
& Smart Contract platform, specifically designed for 
the Natural Asset trading market, at no cost.

Since the Natural Assets will reside directly on a 
blockchain there will be no need for sellers to incur 
the costs related to 3rd party registries to record sales 
and retirement of assets.

An innovative aspect of blockchain technology is that 
it automatically prevents double-spend of natively 
loaded assets, resulting in a fraud-resistant solution.

Since our establishment in 2009, we have been 
pioneering the use of digitally represented Natural 
Assets to prov ide innovat ive env i ronmental 
sustainability solutions. In April 2017 we launched 
the latest version of our climate asset management 
and trading platform that is based on a private 
permissioned blockchain ledger.

There are no registration fees for buyers, and there is 
no need to fund escrow accounts with an exchange, 
as is the current practice, nor are there any limits on 
transaction volumes (unless stipulated by the seller), 
nor will buyers be required to register with 3rd party 
registries; all of which are current barriers to 
participation.

Sellers control their own profit pipeline by having 
access to a range of flexible pricing mechanisms (e.g. 
fixed price, spot rate, various auction types, etc.), 
which they will be able to assign to their asset pool 
based on their chosen percentage of the pool 
allocation; all without long-term contractual lock-in. 

The use of EARTH Tokens (EARTH) as the settlement 
currency reduces complexity related to fiat currency 
exchange rates, along with significantly reduced 
transaction fees. EARTH tokens will be based on 
Ethereum, a next generation blockchain protocol 
enabling advanced smart contracts.

Ethereum is future-proof (e.g. IoT Smart Contracts), 
censorship resistant, globally available, and provides 
transparent guarantees about future operations of 
the platform. With Ethereum, we can eliminate 
middlemen and counterparty risk at the currency 
level.

F u l fi l m e n t  a n d  s e t t l e m e n t  w i l l  t a k e  p l a c e 
simultaneously, based on the terms of the agreed 
Smart Contract between buyers and sellers at the time 
o f  purchase ,  essent ia l l y  e l iminat ing lengthy 
transaction lead times that are commonplace. Just-in-
time purchasing of Natural Assets that is transparent 
and global in scale, will finally be a reality.

Market makers, such as impactChoice & others, will 
have access to Smart Contracts & API's to enable direct 
integration into their systems, for embedding Natural 
Assets directly into their products, services and / or 
solutions.

The ability to mitigate environmental impact in 
complex, integrated manufacturing processes and 
supply-chains, on a pay-as-you-go, just-in-time fashion, 
becomes truly feasible, reducing corporate risk and 
exposure to hedged Natural Assets.

Direct sales to business and consumers will be 
facilitated by using applications that are accessible by 
multiple device types and operating systems (e.g. 
desktop browser, Mobile iOS / Android, etc.), whilst 
specific Smart Contracts and API's will cater for IoT 
connected devices. 

We believe that the proliferation of smart devices will 
ultimately result in a requirement for device enabled 
environmental impact mitigation, via self-regulated 
Smart Contract interfaces.

The development and the adoption of EARTH Token as 
the underpinning store of value and settlement 
mechanism of the Natural Asset Exchange can foster 
unprecedented accessibility and transparency in the 
trading of Natural Assets.

It will truly democratize global efforts that are aiming to 
address climate change adaptation, at corporate, 
consumer and IoT device levels, for the sake of future 
generations.

Emissions per room night

Hotel

(Scope 1 and 2)

Guest

(Scope3)

The diagram above illustrates the concept of “scope 
transfer” related to a business transaction across a 
given supply chain; i.e. an upstream provider's (e.g. the 
Hotel's) combined Scope 1 & 2 emissions, are also the 
downstream consumer's (e.g. the Guest's) Scope 3 
emissions.

Th e r e f o r e ,  b y  m i t i g a t i n g  ( o f f s e t t i n g )  t h e 
environmental impact of the 'room night', both 
parties benefit! 

The hotel deducts the emissions reduction from their 
overall emissions, by association to the transaction, 
whilst the guest receives the actual carbon asset that 
is used to mitigate their environmental impact, 
proportional to their number of 'room night' stays. 

When implementing our environmental impact 
mitigation solution, we transfer an emissions 
mitigating Carbon Asset from the native Carbon Asset 
source wallet address, to a wallet address owned by 
the guest . This provides i r refutable proof of 
environmental impact mitigation.

As the emissions reduction value has been calculated 
based on direct Scope 1 & 2 emissions using the HCMI 
methodology, hospitality providers are legitimately 
ent i t led to c la im carbon neut ra l i t y fo r the i r 
participating guest's emissions. The hotel can then 
deduct the same amount of Scope 1 & 2 emissions in 
their own reporting, by association to the climate asset 
transfer transaction. 

Conversely, recipients of Natural Assets are legitimately 
entitled to use the transferred Scope 3 Natural Assets as 
part of their own environmental impact mitigating 
activities.

For our clients in the business-to-business (B2B) 
market, the above embedded environmental impact 
mitigation activity has proven to be a distinct 
differentiator enabling our clients to win new contracts 
and grow market share. 

8 7

Demand side use-cases

The solutions described below showcase current impactChoice implementations that  
drive demand for Natural Assets via the provision of our unique environmental 
sustainability solutions. Our technology enables our clients to address climate change 
adaptation, and create differentiated value that helps them build brand equity & 
increase market share.

Carbon Mitigation

The impactChoice Carbon Mitigation Solution is an elegant approach to compensating 
for negative environmental impact. It works by apportioning environmental impact 
mitigation mechanisms, and costs, to predetermined business metrics, which are 
directly linked with product, and service delivery, cost of sales models.

We believe it is inevitable that mitigation of environmental impacts associated with the 
provision of products and services will eventually be factored into their price to the 
consumer. Since 2009 we have been developing business models, and technology 
platforms, to enable this shift, thereby adding value to both our clients and their 
downstream customers.

A Hospitality example

Let’s us a Hotel as an example. We start by calculating the 'per room night' carbon 
equivalent footprint associated with providing a room, facilities and services to guests. 
This is achieved by conducting an accredited GHG emissions audit, which in the 
hospitality industry is based on the Hotel Carbon Management Initiative (HCMI) 
developed by the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) and the World Travel & 
Tourism Council (WTTC).

Confirmation of transaction completion is via a multi-
lingual, template driven email, allowing for full 
customisation of content and messaging, in 
accordance to the needs of each client hotel, creating 
an environmental “touch point” with guests in their 
own language, post check-out.

Each transaction results in the generation of a public 
summary page containing information related to the 
asset transfer. Clients and asset recipients are in turn 
able to share these public summary pages via social 
media channels such as Facebook, Twitter and 
LinkedIn to raise their social standing in relation to 
environmental sustainability stewardship.

Whilst there are many changes hotels can make to 
internal processes, behaviours, technology or facilities, 
in order to reduce their emissions, efficiency gains can 
only go so far – there will always be an emissions 
footprint associated with the operations, no matter 
how efficient the processes or technologies they use.

In addition, a number of essential processes or 
technologies often exist that are simply too cost-
prohibitive to alter. The net result – a residual emissions 
footprint that requires mitigation. 

The overall value proposition and benefits of our proven 
emissions mitigation solution can therefore be 
summarised as follows:

According to STR Global, there are between 13.4 million 
and 17.5 million hotel rooms worldwide. Using a 
conservative occupancy rate of only 50% indicates that 
there are in excess of 2.4 billion room nights sold per 
annum.

The hospitality industry alone, therefore, represents a 
significant market opportunity for our Carbon Mitigation 
Solution as described above, and as evidenced via our 
existing hospitality client base.

What we have described above is truly a ubiquitous 
environmental impact mitigation solution that can be 
applied to any business, of any size, in any industry and  
accommodate any use-case. We simply need to package 
and sell the solution in the same manner as we have done 
within the hospitality industry to drive demand.

Climate Neutral Fuel

The impactChoice Climate Neutral Fuel solution is a 
technically proven, turnkey approach to fuel 
management that increases the operat ional 
efficiency of combustion equipment assets, resulting 
in an overall improvement in fuel consumption, 
reduced fuel costs and mitigation of harmful 
emissions associated with the combustion of fuel in 
vehicles, generators and other combustion assets 
vital to business and industry.

Our implementation is based on provision of the 
following distinct core components:

1. EPA registered & SABS SANS:342 compliant fuel 
catalyst

2. Automated bulk fuel treatment dosing plant

3. Carbon Mitigation Solution based on fuel volume 
treated

4. Bulk fuel storage tank gauging & asset level 
dispensing solution

5. Business Intelligence and Reporting console related 
to bulk fuel deliveries, fuel dosing treatments, bulk 
fuel tank gauging & monitoring and asset level fuel 
dispensing & fuel efficiency monitoring

Modern combustion catalysts undeniably improve fuel 
economy. The impactChoice F230/4 Combustion 
Enhancing Catalytic Fuel Optimiser is an EPA 
registered, 4th generation combustion enhancing 
technology based on catalytic effects, manufactured in 
the USA, and licensed to impactChoice for world-wide 
distribution and sale.

The combust ion enhancing technology was 
c o n c e i v e d  d u r i n g  t h e  d e v e l o p m e n t  a n d 
manufacturing of solid rocket fuel for the ATK Thiokol 
rocket booster program in the USA. It was formulated 
based on the understanding of burn rate modifiers 
used in the missile defence programs for the US 
military, and rocket booster technology used by 
NASA. 

The main act ive ingredients are synergist ic , 
multifunctional combustion catalysts that include 
combustion surface modifiers & deposit surface 
modifiers, which can be used with any liquid 
hydrocarbon fuel ranging from gasoline to diesel to 
residual fuel, and has even shown promise for use with 
solid carbon fuels such as coal.

An integral component of our Climate Neutral Fuel 
Solution is the application, or dosing, of the fuel catalyst 
into bulk fuel storage facilities. To ensure continuity of 
solution delivery we intend to install a sophisticated, 
fully-automated bulk Fuel Catalyst Injection Dosing 
System which would be integrated into the bulk fuel 
storage facilities operated by our clients, on a plug & 
play basis.

Our dosing systems will automatically, accurately and 
consistently inject our fuel catalyst into bulk fuel 
storage tanks in all climatic conditions and incorporate 
optional asset level consumption monitoring, data 
logging and near real-time data communications into a 
single system.

The Carbon Mitigation Solution, described above, 
enables bulk-volume fuel consumers to rapidly 
compensate for their environmental impact by 
apportioning direct (Scope 1) emissions from the 
combustion of fuel, while mitigating these emissions 
through the transfer of Natural Assets purchased via 
the Natural Asset Exchange, from internationally 
accredited and verifiable Carbon Asset generation 
mechanisms and projects.

Our bulk fuel storage tank gauging solution is an 
innovative system for monitoring the fluid level inside 
atmospheric tanks. The system detects the static 
pressure generated by the fluid height by means of a 
tube inserted in the tank and displays the fluid level or 
volume.

Supporting flow rates up to 90 l/min with an accuracy 
of +/- 0.5 %, our non-commercial fuel dispensing 
solution enables efficient management, monitoring 
and control of asset refueling.

Asset and / or driver tagging linked to intuitive software 
allows for the monitoring of dispensers, tanks, drivers 
and vehicles in real time. The dispenser features an 
electronic interface, AC pump, automatic nozzle, 
delivery hose and built-in water absorbing filter.

A local site server provides access to real-time 
dispensing and bulk tank level data. Local site data is 
periodically synchronised to our cloud based BI & 
Reporting system for consolidation of all site level 
telemetry.

Since the Bulk Dosing System records live telemetry, 
each client is provided with a customised reporting 
console affording authorised users a view of raw data & 
key indicators such as fuel volumes received / treated, 
fuel catalyst volumes consumed, Net Financial Benefit 
achieved, and more , presented in a Business 
Intelligence Reporting Dashboard. Live telemetry also 
caters for centralized alarm and reaction management.

settlement currency, will allow everyone participate in environmental impact 
mitigation initiatives, allowing the market to grow organically and reach is 
massive potential.

Purchase of energy produced will take place via the 
Natural Asset Exchange using EARTH as the 
settlement instrument in a similar fashion as other 

Natural assets, the only difference being in this case, 
that the asset production facility is directly connected 
to the client at a given geographic location.

Sufficient funding will enable us to establish a Project 
and Strategic Acquisitions Investment Fund team to 
merge financial expertise focused on due diligence, risk 
assessment, and financial modell ing, with our
