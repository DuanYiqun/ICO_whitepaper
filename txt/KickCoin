WHITEPAPER

This document is not an offer of securities or a collective investment scheme, nor does it
require registration with or approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Contributors
are advised to read this document carefully in full, and perform due diligence.

This Whitepaper has been developed in collaboration with our Currency and Financial
advisors (Roel Wolfert, Scott Morris and Edgar Kampers) and has been reviewed by our
Legal advisors.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Vision
Since the late 2000s, when Kickstarter (2009) and Indiegogo (2008) were launched, the
world has been watching the rise of crowdfunding. Many project creators believe that
crowdfunding platforms are just a simple way to raise funds for a project without needing to
attract �ckle VC investment.

However, in fact there are lot of limitations and obstacles.

First, traditional crowdfunding platforms do not accept projects from countries where they
have no presence. Second, they charge high commissions (15-20%), as do the payment
systems people must use to contribute with. Third, they are overwhelmed with "failed"



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 2/56

projects that let down the backers and the platform itself. Fourth, the larger crowd-funding
platforms became all about big companies with strong marketing, rather than about
creators with bright ideas, but no marketing budget.

The crypto-revolution that is happening now will change things, facilitating fundraising and
making it as easy and simple as it is supposed to be. Decentralization, crypto-currency, and
smart-contracts are the new solutions for a project to raise funds.

The fundraisers will no longer be dependent on the platforms, KICKICO is the �rst up-and-
running blockchain fundraising platform that offers comprehensive solutions for ICOs,
crowdfunding, and crowdinvesting.

We provide fundraisers with everything they need: technical solutions, including
smart-contracts, marketing outreach, and also advisory and management expertise,
all driven by our team of 20 fundraising experts.
We provide all projects' backers with a bonus in addition to the tokens they get and we
protect them from unfeasible projects by studying every project's potential and getting
the expert analysis of our advisors (experts in different �elds).
KICKICO and all the projects within its ecosystem form the Kickonomy, a space
powered by KickCoins that perform a variety of utility roles for users and creators.
We are transparent: KickCoin is controlled by the KickCoin fund, which is independent
and ruled by the community.

Our mission is to help innovators, game developers, entrepreneurs, designers, and other
future-thinking creators to bring their ideas to reality regardless to their location, origin, or
socio-economic status.

Unlike many other blockchain start-ups, we have a working product and not just a roadmap.
We will be up and running by October, 2017

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 3/56

Legal governance and compliance
We have invested in seeking out legal and compliance expertise to ensure that KICKICO
meets the new regulatory rules of the Initial Coin Offering at the ICO-stage.

According to the professional opinion of our legal advisors, based on the Howey Test our
KickCoins should not be deemed as securities and do not need to be registered as a
security.

KICKICO focuses on the legislative regulation of ICO, digital tokens and operations with
cryptocurrencies to provide our Users and Contributors safe and reliable solutions for
crowdfunding 2.0.

Market overview



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 4/56

In the mid 2010s the start-up industry is experiencing dramatic changes. The method for
financing companies and projects tends to decentralisation and diversified funding made by
the general public. Venture capital is losing its share while Crowdfunding and ICOs raise
capital at a rapid rate. At the same time the new blockchain technology has given start-ups
the opportunity to fundraise in a more independent and decentralized way.

 

An increased number of successful ICOs and soared funding in general testify high demand
for this method for backers.

ICO market problems
As ICOs, or "Initial Coin Offerings", become increasingly popular, more and more companies
are using this technique as a fundraising mechanism. However, this is a new frontier and
there are no regulations around it. As a result, there are many fraudulent campaigns, where
founders disappear after they have raised funds, essentially scamming the public.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 5/56

The founders of ICOs also face problems. The space is currently very fragmented, there is
no comprehensive list of ICOs, and developers must create their own landing pages and
publicity campaigns from scratch. This reduplication of effort wastes time and resources
that could otherwise have gone into developing a better product.This fragmentation also
affects potential backers adversely. People currently �nd out about ICOs more-or-less at
random.

After someone does make the decision to take part in an ICO, there is another sticking point:
ICOs take place on multiple different exchanges, using multiple different currencies, often
requiring a lengthy veri�cation process. More potential backers are lost at this stage.And
�nally, companies that would like to enter the ICO market, but do not have their own
cryptocurrency or tokens, are completely deprived of such an opportunity. If you are not an
Ethereum developer, it's incredibly challenging to launch an ICO. Thus, as of today, there is
no single convenient venue either for creators of ICO campaigns or their backers. There is
no single platform that allows for convenient viewing and discussion of campaigns without
prior technical knowledge.

Crowdfunding market problems

high commissions

bureauc
racy

high taxesNo localizationsICO

Crowdfunding has its own di�culties. After raising millions of dollars, many large projects
either �opped, never kept their promises, or completely disappeared. As a result, a huge
number of people lost their money along with their belief in crowdfunding. As many as 80-
90% of crowdfunded projects never deliver their product.

The main problem in crowdfunding is that backers are completely unprotected and there
are no guarantees that they will not lose their money. Problems that campaign creators
have to deal with are equally challenging. Launching a Kickstarter campaign requires a
resident to be present in one of the countries of o�cial work, and there is also a lot of
paperwork to �ll out. As a result, many creators have no access to large crowdfunding
platforms, limiting their fundraising opportunities, and narrowing the reach and diversity of
the platforms.Crowdfunding is now dominated by astrotur�ng campaigns run by large, well-
funded companies, rather than indie developers. This inversion of the intended purpose of
crowdfunding happened for �nancial as well as legal reasons. The hidden costs associated
with running a crowdfunding campaign are not commonly recognized:

5% fee to the platform 
3-5% for payment processing 
Costs of rewards for backers 
Fee to a platform residence based intermediary (if the project is not based in the country
where the fundraising platform operates) 
Professional PR services to promote the campaign 
Taxes on funds raised



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 7/56

In the end, creators are only left with 60-80% of the funds raised. This is one reason so
many crowdfunded projects fail to deliver on their promises; there is not enough money left
over after paying the expenses of the campaign. Some crowdfunding campaigns even end
up costing the creator more than they raise.

Solution: KICKICO

 

Versatility

KICKICO's Platform is an online blockchain technology-based crowdfunding
platform which provides its Users (project authors, backers, advisers, escrow-
agents, translators, designers, advertisers) with online fundraising tools that
operate through decentralized blockchain technology and smart contracts.

These tools provide opportunities to:

launch ICOs, pre-ICOs, and crowdfunding campaigns
provide various support services related to the launching of ICOs, pre-ICOs,
and crowdfunding campaigns
ensure the safety of PreICOs, ICOs and other crowfunding campaigns, using
KickCoin cryptocurrency for internal payments

The KICKICO platform supports three kinds of fundraising campaigns: ICO,
crowdinvesting, and crowdfunding. No other platform can boast the same
�exibility and freedom of choice. In the case of pre-ICO and ICO, when backers buy
tokens, they always receive the unique currency created by the KICKICO platform
itself - KickCoins.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 8/56

 

Financial Bene�ts

Therefore, when they support pre-ICO, ICO, or crowdinvesting campaigns, backers
receive two currencies at once, which gives them a double bene�t, and when they
support crowdfunding campaigns, they receive KickCoins, insuring them against
the failure of the project.

  Unlike other platforms that charge a 5-10% commission fee for placement, not to
mention another 5% given to the payment system and 10-30% paid by creators as �at
money taxes, funds on KICKICO are transferred to campaign creators practically in
their entirety in the form of cryptocurrency. The platform charges 4% for ICO
campaigns and 4% for crowdfunding campaigns. This fee is taken when the project
has successfully �nished fundraising. In the case of ICO campaigns that mint new
tokens for backers, KICKICO additionally takes 4% of the tokens or cryptocurrency
produced by that campaign. This fee is transferred to the KickICO reserve fund (see
Fund section below).



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 9/56

 

Crowdfunding campaigns

 

Comparison of various commissions and rates to attract backers from all over the
world (including bank account fees)

All other funds are immediately transferred to a campaign creator who decides
where, how, and on what terms their taxes will be paid. Therefore, many creators of
crowdfunding campaigns launched on KICKICO pay only 4% fees in ETH as
compared to a minimum of 15%-40% if they are launched on �rst-generation
crowdfunding platforms.

  Creators of many campaigns do not need to create their own cryptocurrency or
tokens. For example, a creator raises funds to produce a play or record an album.
Such creators cannot launch ICOs, and all they can do is promise some rewards to
their backers. In the vast majority of cases, backers do not receive anything but
promises, because their interests are not protected. KICKICO platform solves this
problem by providing backers with its own currency, KickCoins. Thus, when they



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 10/56

 

support crowdfunding campaigns with their money, backers get not only promises
(as on other crowdfunding platforms) but also a real valuable asset - KickCoins in the
amount of up to 20% of their contribution as a bonus.

 

Comparison of the advertising campaign cost in developed countries with costs
when raising funds on KICKICO

We believe that the currency will not only grow in value over time but will later
probably be accepted for payment on the KICKICO platform itself. The liquidity and
utility of KickCoins will be provided by the possibility of using this virtual currency on
the KICKICO platform as payment for various services. The owner of a KickCoin will
be able to use this virtual currency to launch ICOs, pre-ICOs, and crowdfunding
campaigns, acquire professional help for designing a crowdfunding campaign, as
well as pay for various services of advisers, moderators of crowd-hosting campaigns,
translators, designers and other contributors around the World.

Thus, the KICKICO platform creates a completely new concept: "ICOs for
crowdfunding".



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 11/56

Crowdinvesting campaigns

 

Synergy

 

Not a single popular crowdfunding platform currently allows creators to conduct
crowdinvesting campaigns (sometimes called equity crowdfunding campaigns). This
is because there is no legal structure that allows many backers, from many different
countries, to become bene�ciaries of a start-up. However, Ethereum technology
allows us to forget about such problems. The code can do what the legal system
couldn't. We now have the opportunity to organize crowdinvesting campaigns not only
for residents of one country, but for the population of the whole world, regardless of
their place of residence, jurisdiction, nationality, and other bureaucratic obstacles.
Crowdinvesting campaigns are similar to ICO campaigns, but the tokens give some
part either in ownership of the company, or a share of pro�ts, or something else the
campaign creator decides on (it is different for each campaign).

With the features described above, KICKICO creates a synergized place for different
audiences that did not interact before, such as creators of ICO and cryptocurrency
projects and their backers, or creators of classical crowdfunding campaigns and their
backers who have never dealt with cryptocurrencies before, authors of their projects
and experienced army of advisors, moderators, designers, translators and other
specialists all over the World. All parties bene�t from KICKICO's new system: creators
get access to new audiences and sources of funding and help from different kinds of
advisers, while also signi�cantly lowering their overhead. Backers for the �rst time get
a guarantee against the failure of their projects, get the chance to receive value equity
in return for their payments, and get access to a broader range of projects. Advisors,
moderators, designers, translators and other specialists from all over the World get
the opportunity to receive value in return for their contribution.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 12/56

KickCoins

KickCoin digital token is a virtual currency, which is designed to be used by project authors
for mutual settlements inside KIСKIСO to pay for the launch of their crowdfunding projects,
to purchase services for crowdfunding projects, and for other internal processes and
payments within the infrastructure of the KICKICO and KICKONOMY. KickCoin is a
cryptocurrency awarded to backers who support preICO, ICO, or crowdfunding campaigns.

KickCoins are generated by the smart contract automatically when backers support
campaigns that are launched on the platform. Therefore, KickCoins are never 'made out of
thin air' but are always backed by other currencies, as well as by campaigns successfully
completed on the platform. Additionally, KickCoins will never be in excessive surplus. They
are always backed not only by other currencies but by campaigns themselves, and only by
those that were successfully completed on the platform.

The only exception is the initial pre-generation of KickCoins. A total of 457 760 867,8408
KickCoins have been generated, including 30 million to conduct preICO, and 300 million to
conduct ICO. 10% of total KickCoins supply will be generated and shared between the
founders of KICKICO, and the rest have been generated for advisory, lottery, bounty, seed
backers and PR pools. KickCoins are not mined by users or any other companies.

KickCoin Emission
For ICO campaigns, the platform fee will be 4% of collected ETH, and 4% of the campaign's
tokens. In return, we provide from 4 to 8% of the KickCoins (in effect, selling our KickCoins
to the campaign creator in exchange for the fee). Those KickCoins will be given to backers,
together with the campaign tokens.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 13/56

For crowdfunding campaigns, we give backers from 4% to 20% of the value of their
contribution as KickCoins, depending on their reputation on the site (Karma scores). This
rate is being taken from exchanges, but will never be less than 0.0005 ETH per KickCoin.

KickCoin emission for backing projects on the platform is not in�nite. The emission will stop
as soon as KickCoin gets widespread on the market and gains liquidity to be accepted as a
payment method. By doing so, we encourage a more thorough distribution of KICK among
tokenholders which leads to a more decentralized ecosystem.

This system ensures that in both ICOs and crowdfunding campaigns, the backer gets
cryptocurrency for their contribution. We have two requirements for creators of
crowdfunding campaigns that want us to provide KickCoins to their campaigns:

1. They must provide us with a photo ID, and proof of address in the form of a utility bill or
bank statement (as when verifying with a payment system), so we'll know they are real and
who they are;

2. An ICO campaign must raise at least $50,000. Smaller campaigns are too risky, because
they may become targets for a recursion attack, in which someone creates a campaign,
pays his own money (through dummy backer accounts), receiving his own money, AND our
KickCoins.

3. For crowdfunding campaigns with the goal less than $50,000, KICK will be generated in
accordance to their funding fees, i.e. 4%.

Fund
KICKICO charges a fee from successfully completed campaigns in two versions: 4% in ETH
and 4% of the project tokens which were emitted by it (in cases where the project issues
their own tokens). 4% of the fees go to ensuring the maintenance and development of the
platform, and 4% of the tokens will automatically be sent to the KICKONOMY reserve fund .

As the platform develops, more and more tokens of third-party projects will accumulate in
the fund. By 2019, we project that there will be at least �ve hundred different tokens in the
reserve fund. In the event, even if only 10% of these tokens show multiple growth, the value



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 14/56

of the reserve fund will increase many times, and with it the value of KICK.

In the future, we plan to register a non-pro�t foundation as a separate entity. This will be
feasible when all necessary regulatory approvals are clari�ed, primarily the SEC and MAS.
After that, the fund will be o�cially registered as a separate legal entity (fund), and
management will be decentralized and transferred to the community, which annually elects
its representatives - delegates.

Delegates will receive the right to manage the fund: transfer of "garbage" tokens into the
reserve fund, improvement and strengthening of the fund's portfolio, and other
organizational functions. Management will be carried out by voting, with a 51% consensus
among the voters.

KICKONOMY

This term de�nes the ecosystem of projects that accept KickCoins. If a project launched on
the platform has the KICKONOMY banner, it means that after its release it will accept
KickCoins for payment. Thus, the more campaigns involved in KICKONOMY, the more liquid
and popular KickCoins become.

KICKICO is a platform on which users will be able to launch fundraising for their ICO,
crowdfunding or crowdinvesting projects. Users can also ontribute in ICOs, preICO
campaigns, or support crowdfunding. Fundraising is carried out in Ethereum (ETH), so both
authors and those who contribute in their campaigns (further backers) can be from
anywhere in the world.

KICKONOMY ideology

It is important that the relationship between authors, backers and the community be
mutually bene�cial and strong. KICKICO expands the framework of the platform, creating a
transparent ecosystem to unite the community, backers and projects. Long before the
launch of the platform, we created the principles for organizing the relationships between all
participants of KICKONOMY.

The balanced and limited issue of KickCoins is tied to campaigns successfully being
completed on the platform. The KickCoin = ETH starting rate for emissions after the release
of the platform will be �xed at the level of 1 KickCoin=0.0005 ETH, which forms the value of
the token in the eyes of the backers participating in the campaigns. However, with the
growth of the exchange rate, the emission rate will be adjusted for the market, so the
emission rate on the platform won’t reduce the market value of KICK.

We are organizing rules of circulation that stimulate demand, thanks to unique goods,
services and privileges for users, minus the limited emission.

Business - KICKONOMY open environment, and KickCoin free currency, any business
can easily use KickCoin as a means of payment within the platform, and attract a new,
loyal, solvent audience to their projects

KickCoin is the fuel of KICKONOMY, a freely circulating cryptocurrency, and a convenient
payment instrument

Community - backers, activists, consumers of project services.

Projects are already functioning businesses or projects that are at the launch stage who
are in the process of crowdfunding or crowdinvesting campaigns;

Marketplace is an internal platform service that combines products and services for
projects, including unique ones. Allows projects to receive an in�ux of a new loyal
audience and funds, which increases the liquidity of KickCoin

Services - KICKICO plans to create a self-regulating KickCoin community reward system
for useful activities such as translations, surveys, localization and promotion, by giving
project authors a convenient tool to attract community

Exchange is a tool that supports the liquidity of KickCoin and the liquidity of the project's
tokens



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 16/56

—  Fund, as a separate entity, governed by the community

An important key to encouraging participation in a community, currency or an economy with
a free market is a fair accounting system that fully re�ects the contribution of each
participant. The given decision will allow the organization of an effective decentralized, self-
regulating environment, by means of a system of motivation, ratings, and voting by
participants.

The ability of each member of the community to participate through voting, along with the
ability to extract dividends as a result of the operation of the nodes, will create an additional
incentive to possess KICK, and will additionally support the platform.

The rating system on the platform will allow users to get additional motivation for the
development of the platform, as well as its separate services: this thesis has been well
tested on the Steem platform. The KICKICO team develops its own system of degrees of
popularity and numerical evaluation of user activity based on existing experience, but using
its own unique algorithms.

The reputational system allows minimal effort to correct with the necessary precision the
actions of each of the participants in the system, as well as of individual groups and even
the entire community as a whole, which, of course, positively affects the evolution of all
components of the environment.

Platform Earnings



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 17/56

KICKICO platform will take 4% commission from crowdfunding campaigns from all received
ETH. The commission is transferred to the KICKICO account after successful completion of
the fundraising. This comission goes to ensuring the maintenance and development of the
platform Also there is a comission of 4% emitted tokens of any project (the only exception is
pure fundraising, where no tokens are produced) that automatically is sent to the
KICKONOMY Reserve Fund.

As a result, this Fund forms a cryptocurrency basket, in which may be thousands of
different cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, a 4% commission on tokens of crowdinvesting
campaigns means that KICKONOMY Reserve Fund will become a minority
"cryptoshareholder" of each company, which has successfully completed the fundraising on
the platform, and will receive "cryptoincome" from such companies. The portfolio of the
Fund is managed by professionals and the community, only reliable and prospective tokens
with high growth potential are left, which will increase the capitalization of KICKICO, and
support the cost of KickCoins (KICK).

KickCoins and KICKONOMY

KickCoins (KICK) is a ETH-based token that follows the ERC-20 standard. KICK is generated
in two versions. The �rst, generally accepted option is the generation of pools for the needs
of the company, such as payment for localization services, referral programs, bounty
awards, etc., as well as pre-sales for pre-ICO and ICO.

KICK received by people who �nancially supported the campaigns on the platform (backers)
will be accepted as payment in a variety of projects, such as those that successfully collect
funds on our platform and become participants of the KICKONOMY. For existing and
functioning ones,a special department will be formed for dealing with agreements with
interesting companies. Games, applications, platforms, exchanger, and even o�ine projects
will become participants in the KICKONOMY network. We already have a number of such
companies that will be launched right after the platform release in October 2017, along with
those already functioning and interested in cooperation. For those that will be running on
the platform, this is necessary for functioning on the platform (which gives a lot of tra�c
and visibility), placing projects in the KICKONOMY directory, and to get completely free
tra�c and customers willing to spend not only their KICK, but other money. In addition, we
will use our marketing budgets to support precisely these campaigns because it is more
pro�table for us than to simply advertise the platform itself. The more successful projects
we have, the better and more attractive the platform will be. This indirectly positively affects
the course of KICK.

Important part of KICKONOMY is how KickCoins are used to create the circulation of
currency and create supply and demand mechanisms.

KickCoins are useful in multiple use cases in the ecosystem on the platform:

1. For authors

Payment for a review - get a quali�ed review of the campaign from selected memebers
of community.

Draft moderation - a low fee (just symbolic) to moderate a camapign. Part of the fee will
be allocated to a quality-checking moderator

Moderation before launching - every campaign goes through moderation before launch.
Initially it will be made by platform o�cers, then moderation will be performed by those
who are chosen by community as well as by campaign advisers

Paying for smart-contract deploy - the creation of smart-contracts for tokens and
crowdsale will also require a fee

Guarantee of getting into our digest - there will be different types of digests: daily, hot,
new ones (which are just launched), community choice, editor’s choice, week’s best, etc

Payment for translation and proofreading services - to be successful globally many
languages are required, so there is an option to receive such services from the
community on the platform

Payment for creative content - visual assets, video assets, voice overs, and advertising
materials are critical for a project that wants to get noticed

Payment for the services of community advisors - get support for your project from
quali�ed advisors and increase attention to the campaign

Autobounty - paying for actions of community members to spread the word about the
campaign

2. For community

Election of community advisors - voting for advisors requires symbolic sum to cast a
vote

Electing moderators - same as previous, voting for moderators requires symbolic sum to
cast a vote

Voting for a project - an additional option for a campaign to get higher position and
become ‘the choice of the community’ campaign

Social bene�ts - it is actually for fun, some decoration, such as a ‘golden frame of the
avatar’. It could be a special, unusual font in comments, the background of a user’s



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 19/56

pro�le, or something else which lasts for some period of time

Fine and penalty payments, set by moderators - penalties for swearing, spam, �ood,
indecent actions, and other actions that break the code of conduct. The sum of penalty
may grow if the inappropriate actions are repeated by users

Virtual gifts - the option to exchange interactive gift among users on the platform, like
�owers, a glass of tea, a lucky ticket or something else

With the platform development more uses of KickCoins will be adding to increase the
liquidity

KickCoins growth forecast

The formation of a large number of projects participating in KICKONOMY is the basis for the
growth of the price of the KICK: if more games, services, shops and other businesses will
use KICK, the more in-demand and the higher their liquidity will be. KICKICO is building its
business model speci�cally on the creation of such projects, increasing their number and
connecting existing ones to the KICKONOMY. However, this won't only positively affect the
cost of the KICK. Cryptocurrencies are very sensitive to signi�cant events, and we
understand this.

 

Expected number of projects, raising funds on KICKICO

The launch of large campaigns on the platform will attract additional attention to it. Each
launch of a campaign such as this on the platform will positively in�uence the reputation of
the platform and the KICK course.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 20/56

 

Growth of the GDP of KICKONOMY

Successfully completed campaigns give us three positive events: the campaign is being
prepared for launch, the campaign has been launched on the platform, and the campaign
has successfully raised funds. Each of these reasons supports not only the campaign itself,
but also a platform,together with KICK.

Since KICKICO takes half the commission of ICO campaigns in their tokens, the positive
growth of these cryptocurrencies affects the entire portfolio of the platform and, thus,
indirectly supports the value of KICK.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 21/56

 

Forecast. The growth rate of the KickCoin

We have formed a department that focuses on the strategic development of the
KICKONOMY by connecting existing large companies. We plan to connect the top players of
different markets. Just a few large campaigns on the level of, for example, Wargaming, can
increase the demand for KickCoins by several times.

Issue of KickCoins

The initial issuance of KickCoins is set to 457,760,867.8408 KICK. Unsold KICK that were
created for sale during pre-ICO and ICO will be frozen on a smart-contract without the
possibility of their subsequent withdrawal or use (they will actually be
destroyed(burned)).The initial issue of KickCoins is programmed by a smart contract and
will be carried out in the following order:

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 24/56

Smart token

The majority of tokens that are issued by projects raising funds on KICKICO platform, do not
have enough capitalization to be listed and traded on big crypto-exchanges. However, we
integrate the solution that still allows these tokens to become liquid and be sold, exchanged,
and bought (after the end of project’s ICO) by anyone.

We recommend them to choose a built-in option to activate Bancor protocol and make
reserves for their tokens in ERC-20 reserve tokens (We recommend to use KickCoin as a
main reserve currency, making KickCoin a network token for the platform).

This solution allows:

Make any token liquid;
Support the value of KickCoin, since we consider KickCoin the main reserve token;
Give the backers an opportunity to sell their tokens at any time. If the value of a
project (and a token) increases, a backer can sell it and get pro�t. If a project fails, a
backer will still be able to sell it but, however, for a lower rate.

This solution is optional and the decision will be made by the project author, when �lling the
form by clicking the appropriate check-box.

KickCoin itself is a Smart token. This means that Bancor protocol is integrated into our
Smart-contract and we reserve a certain % of our funds in BNT (or any other ERC-20
currency).



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 25/56

Conclusion

We are already in open beta mode, and in September-October 2017 there will be a
platform release where anyone can launch the campaign.
We work with all campaigns: crowdfunding, crowdinvesting, pre-ICO and ICO, which
can issue their own tokens and won’t be tied to our platform.
In this regard, backers will be more willing to pay into the campaign - after all, they will
receive not only illusory promises, as on other platforms, but also KICK that can later
be sold or used for payment in companies participating in the KICKONOMY.
We know exactly what is needed for both companies and for single authors. What do
backers need? What is needed by the whole ecosystem and the Ethereum blockchain.
And we make a functional token that will be convenient, useful for everyone and won’t
lead the blockchain into decline.
We have one of the lowest commissions on the market.
Due to the fact that the authors collect cryptocurrency contributions, they get a unique
opportunity to choose a convenient residence for taxation.
Unlike 99% of ICO campaigns, we don’t just create another cryptocurrency in an
already crowded market. We are building a KICKONOMY, in which KickCoins are a tool
and a method, and not the basis of future pro�t.
We will accept all popular cryptocurrencies and �at money and unite two big
industries: crowdfunding (�at money) and ICO (cryptocurrencies). These completely
different audiences will mutually engage each other in projects and campaigns that
they couldn’t even think of before.
We have an excellent, competitive team that will cope with any di�culties and will
realize everything that is stated in the Whitepaper.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 26/56

Not only does the KICKONOMY directly increase the value of KickCoins, but it also supports
backers if the campaigns do not keep their promises, giving them a liquid currency in the
form of KickCoins. KickCoins can be used to buy rewards from other campaigns launched
on KICKICO, or to participate in any projects that are a part of the KICKONOMY. If a backer
donates to a festival that never gets launched, or a play that never gets produced, their
money is not lost (as with �rst-generation crowdfunding platforms), they have simply
bought a cryptocurrency.

When KickCoins reach a certain market value, KICKICO will cease their emission and start
accepting them for payment for campaigns. Backers who have KickCoins on their accounts
will be able to exchange them for products or services of campaigns hosted on the
platform, while �nancially supporting those projects at the same time. This will be an
important moment in the development of KICKONOMY, because it will increase the liquidity
and value of KickCoins, as well as the demand for them.

When there are a certain number of campaigns in the KICKONOMY ecosystem, a special
section (market) will be opened on the platform for active and completed projects -
members of the KICKONOMY ecosystem. Backers that received KickCoins will be able to
visit any of them and spend their KickCoins if they wish.

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

Users
Registration

All users must be registered on the platform to carry out any activities. Registration is a
standard process through email, or you can sign in through Facebook, Google, Twitter.

KickCoin wallet (KCW)

All users of the platform have their own unique wallet created automatically. If a user
requests, their wallet can be replaced with a different ID, which may be necessary if the
user's access to their wallet is somehow lost. The password for a newly created wallet is
the same as the user's account on the platform, but it can be changed if the user wishes.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 27/56

Backers

A user who supports any campaign on the platform receives the status of backer. Backers
can be creators at the same time. If a backer supports a campaign that has its own
cryptocurrency or token, then it will be sent to that backer's Ethereum wallet

Anonymous mode

Some backers may wish to remain anonymous. In this case, they will be able to turn on
'Anonymous mode' in the settings of their pro�le, after which other users will not be able to
view it, and when they make pledges, their avatar, �rst name, and surname are hidden -
creators and users can only see that a certain amount of money was pledged at a certain
time by some anonymous user. However, anonymous users are not able to post comments
or send messages to creators while they are in anonymous mode. If a user turns off the
anonymous mode, all their previous actions remain anonymous. Similarly, comments or
actions made by a user in the non-anonymous mode do not become anonymous if they
turn on this feature in the settings.

Creators

A creator is a user who created their own campaign. After creating a campaign, a user
becomes its creator and receives the corresponding status and access. In order to avoid
misunderstandings and to improve the quality of the platform content, the same creator can
create only one launched campaign at a time but may create any number of drafts. Drafts
that have passed moderation are 'Public Drafts' and will be listed on the 'Public Drafts' page.
If the creator has set the launch date, they become 'Upcoming' and will appear on the
'Upcoming' page or the main page, depending on the stage of platform development.

Users' privacy

No personal user data is available to other users or moderators working on the platform.
This list includes but is not limited: emails, wallet IDs, or funds available to users, as well as
direct links to accounts in social networks, even if they are speci�ed in the user's form.
Senior moderators can see transactions performed on the platform.

Campaign is a page where the campaign creator describes their project to potential
backers. It may include videos, images, and text descriptions. A campaign is created by a
single creator and is permanently linked to their pro�le. All campaigns have certain settings,
some of which are mandatory and some of which are optional. For example, the target
amount of funds to be raised and the fundraising duration are mandatory settings, while the
availability of awards or cryptocurrency is optional.Only the creator of a campaign and
moderators can edit it, submit it for moderation, launch it, or cancel it. There can be four
types of campaigns placed on KICKICO: preICO, ICO, crowdinvesting, and crowdfunding (to
be speci�ed during the creation process).

Campaign stages

Every campaign will undergo following stages on the platform:

draft: when a user creates a new campaign and completes all the �elds required for the
campaign description and adds all the materials like presentations, whitepaper, team
and other information required

pending moderation: the campaign is sent to be reviewed and moderated by the
platform team. A manager is assigned to guide the campaign and comment on any
improvements needed. The campaign will be returned to the creator if it’s lacking crucial
data about the campaign description or something is unclear or poorly presented, i.e,
team, whitepaper etc.

public draft: the campaign becomes visible for all users of the platform in 'Public Drafts'
so that the creator can gather more feedback from the community and work on more
improvements to the campaign that will help it become successful.

ready to launch: the campaign has met all the requirements for launching, has created
the crowdsale contract and launched enough marketing and PR activity to attract
backers

ongoing: campaign is launched and everyone can participate. The campaign appears in
the ongoing section

completed: when the campaign is �nished - it goes to this section with other completed
campaigns

A campaign might also be canceled or banned. 
Campaigns can be banned by the platform's employees for violating its rules, for fraud, or
attempted fraud.

Crowdfunding campaigns

These classical campaigns have almost identical features to the campaigns launched on
�rst-generation crowdfunding platforms. The only difference is that campaigns on the
KICKICO platform have smart contracts that all collected funds are transferred to. These



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 29/56

campaigns can be of two types: All-or-Nothing, or Safe. These types are explained below.
The type, as well as the target amount of collected funds, is chosen by the creator. Owing to
its label, all visitors can easily identify the type of a campaign. All campaigns on the
platform are time-limited, regardless of their type. The maximum duration of a campaign is
90 days.

All-or-Nothing campaigns

All-or-Nothing campaigns will not receive funds if they do not collect the necessary amount
in a given time frame. If that happens, the smart contract will return funds to the backers. At
the same time, backers supporting these campaigns receive KickCoins only if such
campaigns are completed successfully. As a result, backers are more motivated to
contribute to the success of a campaign. Their assistance in spreading information, helping
the campaign, writing posts in social networks or articles in their blogs, etc., is incentivized.
All-or-Nothing campaigns are for those creators who are self-con�dent or who can only
keep their promises if they collect the required amount in its entirety.

Safe campaigns

These campaigns will end successfully in any case, even if they do not reach the
established goal. KickCoins and project tokens (if they were created) will be sent out to the
backers. Since this imposes an increased risk, it will be more di�cult for such campaigns to
undergo moderation in connection with higher requirements to the quality of the project and
the availability of a minimum operating product.

PreICO and ICO campaigns

Campaigns of this type differ from crowdfunding 1.0 campaigns in having a smart contract
that allows them to automatically distribute their own cryptocurrency (or tokens) to the
backers supporting the project. As with crowdfunding 1.0 campaigns, creators of preICO
and ICO campaigns can add rewards for different tiers. ICO and preICO campaigns can be
of an All-or-Nothing or Safe type.

Rewards

Rewards on KICKICO will be similar to those on crowdfunding 1.0 platforms: the creator
indicates what the backer will receive for pledging a certain amount of ETH. By making a
pledge, a backer receives this award (either at the end of the campaign or, after the project
is implemented), as well as the equivalent amount of KickCoins at the current exchange
rate. Thus, the backer does not just give away their money, but exchanges it for the reward
plus the KickCoins provided by KICKICO.

Creators launching ICO campaigns can use awards to implement a bonus system. For
example, a backer buying a tier for 10 ETH can get 50 tokens, and when they buy a reward
for 20 ETH, they can get 120 tokens. The quantities for every tier and exchange rates are set



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 30/56

at the creator's discretion. In addition to campaign tokens, backers of ICO campaigns also
receive KickCoins at an exchange rate currently on the market, or at a minimum rate if the
price has not been determined yet. Tier bonus is also applied to KickCoin

Goals

Campaigns can have different types of goals:

1. Time-limited campaigns collect funds until the speci�ed time is over (which was the
generally accepted system in �rst-generation crowdfunding).

2. Campaigns with funding goals collect funds until the target amount is reached, which
is speci�ed in ETH.

3. Campaigns with a �xed number of tokens to sell. This option is suitable for ICO
campaigns. When creating campaigns, its creator selects the desired goal and
deadline. After a campaign is launched, its goal cannot be changed.

Thus, campaigns come in the following con�gurations:

1. ICO/preICO All-or-Nothing, time-limited campaigns, with a goal to collect the whole
required amount in a time frame speci�ed by the campaign creator.

2. ICO/preICO All-or-Nothing Tokensale, with a goal to sell all tokens created by the
campaign in a time frame speci�ed by the creator. These campaigns need to sell all of
their tokens, and if they fail to do so, the smart contract marks their campaign as
unsuccessful, and returns all funds to the backers, and the tokens are not transferred.

3. ICO/pre-ICO Safe Crowdsale, with a goal to collect as much funding as possible in a
speci�ed time frame. Here the �nal amount is not so important. This could be used by
a cryptocurrency start-up selling their currencies in an ICO.

4. ICO/preICO, Safe Tokensale, with the goal to sell as many tokens as possible in a
speci�ed time frame, but without the requirement of selling all the tokens or closing
the campaign.

5. All-or-Nothing Crowdfunding, with a goal to collect the entire amount required in a
speci�ed time frame. This is the most similar to the crowdfunding 1.0 model, but
achieves lower fees and less red tape by using Ether.

6. Safe Crowdfunding, with a goal to collect as much as possible in a speci�ed time
frame, but such campaigns assert that they will ful�ll their obligations to backers even
if they do not collect the required amount. Not all campaigns submitted for
moderation in this system can be approved. If the moderators believe that a campaign
may fail to ful�ll its obligations by not collecting the entire amount, this campaign will
be refused.

Drafts



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 31/56

Drafts can be of two types: private and public. Private drafts are only visible to the creator
themselves, or to those provided by the creator with a special preview link. Public drafts can
be viewed in a special 'Drafts' section and are visible to all visitors. The creator can change
the status of their campaign from private to public at any time. However, in order for a draft
to become public, it must undergo moderation. Public drafts are useful for campaigns that
announce upcoming fundraising, and conduct preliminary PR activities, or ask the
community for help in improving the quality of their campaign. If a draft is public, you can
get feedback from the community and make appropriate adjustments before your
fundraising starts, after which it is too late to make changes.

Users can subscribe to be noti�ed of updates to the campaign. Users who pressed the
'Notify me' button will receive automatic reminders that the launch is near or that a new
launch date has been set for the campaign. In addition, users who have subscribed to
noti�cations will even receive updates prepared by the campaign creator for drafts. That
said, public drafts are a convenient place for the preliminary PR activities of a campaign.

When the creator decides that their campaign is ready for launch, they should submit it for
moderation, even if the campaign has been veri�ed before its transition to the public status.
Campaigns that do not pass moderation cannot be launched on the platform.

Coming Soon

This section is for campaigns that have passed moderation but are currently at the public
draft stage. They are sorted by launch dates: the closer the launch date is, the higher the
campaign is on the list. As a result, all visitors to the platform can see which campaigns are
about to launch, what they are about, and when and what amount they are aiming to collect.
If a user is interested in a campaign, or decides that they want to participate in it, they will
subscribe to noti�cations and track its progress starting from the draft stage. This system
helps creators build an audience in advance in order to give a powerful boost to a campaign
from the very start of the fundraising, which greatly in�uences its future and increases the
chances of its successful completion.

Moderation

Moderation is performed by users with the status of 'Moderator' or higher. The status of
moderator can be appointed both to platform employees who work under a contract, and to
regular users who have gained a good reputation. During the veri�cation process,
moderators must check if a campaign, and the product for which funds are collected, is
valid and to ensure the campaign does not violate the rules of the platform. If a campaign is
approved by moderators, it is granted permission to launch.

Publication



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 32/56

After a campaign has passed moderation, it becomes available for publication. The creators
themselves decide when they will launch their campaign and can do so by pressing the
'LAUNCH CAMPAIGN' button in the campaign settings. Moreover, the creator can specify a
delayed time for the launch of the campaign - in which case it will launch without the
creator's participation at the speci�ed time. Published campaigns become visible to all
visitors of the platform.

Comments

All users that are registered on the platform and who have access to a draft can post
comments. Owing to that, creators can receive quick feedback not only from their
acquaintances, but also from the KICKICO community. Campaign creators can delete
comments.

Comment authors are not able to delete or edit their comments after they are published.

Updates

Campaign creators can post updates both for drafts and for launched campaigns. Updates
can have videos, images, texts, and hyperlinks. After the update is posted, all of the users
signed up for noti�cations on the campaign, and those who supported it (in the case of
active campaigns), receive noti�cations via the email speci�ed in their pro�les.

Users can leave comments on the creator's updates, unless the creator has turned off this
function. After the update is published, the creator is not able to edit or delete it. The creator
is warned of this before publication.

KICKONOMY banner

This banner placed on the campaign page means that the campaign creator has committed
their project to participate in the KICKONOMY ecosystem. Thus, the creator declares and
promises their backers that their product will (or already does) accept KickCoins as a
means of payment, at a rate of conversion listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Thus, the
backers who support their campaign, and receive KickCoins in return, know that they will be
able to spend their KickCoins on offerings from this project. This could include access to
premium content of a video game, tickets to a music festival, or a limited edition of a book.

Featuring

Featuring means that a campaign is placed in the top block of the platform, visually
highlighted, and awarded with the 'Featured' badge. Featuring is set by platform
administrators after making a subjective decision based on such factors as high-quality
preparation, traction, the number of backers, the creator's activity in terms of updates and
work with the community, and participation in the KICKONOMY.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 33/56

All featured campaigns appear in the weekly digest and the daily mass mail sent to all users
who have subscribed to either of them.

In social networks, KICKICO publishes featured campaigns on its o�cial pages and in its
groups, and every time a campaign gets into the featured list, the platform publishes
corresponding news on Twitter.

Campaign completion

There can be two ways to complete a campaign: to successfully raise funds or to fail.
Failing occurs if this is an All-or-Nothing campaign and its speci�ed time has come to an
end without having achieved the goal. In all other cases, a campaign ends successfully, and
if this is an All-or-Nothing campaign, funds are transferred to the creator's Ethereum wallet,
and tokens and KickCoins to their backers' Ethereum wallets.

Completed campaigns are shown in the pro�les of the creators who created them, and in
the special 'Finished Campaigns' section. Campaigns that have failed are not shown on the
Finished Campaigns page but remain available by following the link.

Easy integration of analytics

Many creators who have launched on other platforms have had to invent various ways to
gather statistics on their campaigns. Nowhere are you provided with a simple, convenient,
and easy way to do it. We are solving this problem with automatic integration of Google
Analytics and Facebook Pixel into launched campaigns. All that is required of a campaign
creator is to enter their Google Analytics ID in one �eld, and their Facebook Pixel ID in the
other.

EXAMPLES OF USING THE PLATFORM

Running ICOs or pre-ICOs
General information

The platform is ideal for running ICO campaigns. It happens like this:



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 34/56

1. A creator gets registered on the platform, and creates their campaign where they
describe what it is about, how and for whom it works, its principles, and then adds
images and video materials, if any.

2. Then the creator adds their token or cryptocurrency in the settings of their pre-ICO or
ICO campaign. This token is made by the creator themselves, but later KICKICO will
also offer an opportunity to create a token for them - they will only need to select its
name and specify the desired parameters.

3. Also, the creator can specify the duration of the campaign and its purpose (collect
1,000 ETH, sell 10,000 tokens, or simply the duration of the campaign).

4. Next, the creator sets rewards and speci�es how much each of them costs in ETH
and how many of their own tokens they will give in every case. For example, they can
give 100 of their tokens for 1 ETH and 1,200 of them for 10 ETH, thus creating a
system of discounts and lucrative offers.

Crowdfunding
If we examine crowdfunding, everything is even easier for an creator and looks almost the
same as on other platforms.

1. The creator gets registered on the platform and creates their campaign where they
describe what it is about, how and for whom it works, adds images and video
materials, if any.

2. Then the creator can specify the duration of their campaign, its type (All-or-Nothing or
Safe) and goal (for example, collect 1000 ETH).

3. Next, the creator creates rewards, specifying how much each of them costs in ETH,
and explains what backers will receive when the campaign is completed or the
product is released.

4. Then the campaign passes moderation and gets launched on the platform at the time
speci�ed by the creator. After the campaign is over, the creator receives all collected
funds, and their backers receive KickCoins as a form of insurance if the creator does
not ful�ll their promises.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 35/56

Crowdinvesting Campaigns
No crowdfunding platform currently allows creators to conduct crowdinvesting campaigns.
This is mainly due to the limitations of legislative systems in different countries, the
absence of regulations, and the complexities of legal registration. However, modern
blockchain technologies allow us to forget about such problems and organize
crowdinvesting campaigns not only for residents of one country, but for the population of
the whole world, regardless of their place of residence, jurisdiction, nationality, and other
bureaucratic obstacles.

Crowdinvesting campaigns are almost identical to ICO campaigns, but each of the tokens
entitles the holder to a share of the pro�ts, part ownership of the company, or something
else, such as voting rights. (It is different for each campaign.) In the process described
above, users are backers, or they may become co-owners of the company, or both, or
something else depending on what the possession of the company's tokens gives them.

For example, a creator sells 50% of all pre-created company tokens and declares that
backers will get a share in the company's pro�ts according to the percentage of tokens they
own. In this case, an backer who buys half of these 50% of tokens will become the owner of
25% of the company's tokens and receive 25% of the company's pro�ts.

MONEY
Backing the campaign

Any user registered on the platform can back a campaign if it is active (launched).

In the case of campaigns that distribute tokens to backers, regardless of whether this is an
All-or-Nothing or Safe campaign, the smart contract holds all the funds until the campaign
is completed. If fundraising is successful, then all of the funds from this unique wallet,
minus the platform fee, are transferred to the creator's wallet, and the backers receive their
rewards and KickCoins in proportion to their pledges. If a campaign fails, the funds are
returned to the backers' wallets from which they were transferred and they receive no
KickCoins or rewards.



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 36/56

Later, the platform will allow users to use external BTC wallets, or they can generate new
wallets on the user's account. Users will be able to add funds to these wallets from outside
or transfer funds from them to their private wallets, exchanges, or markets. Campaigns
launched on the KICKICO platform can be backed from these wallets.

Automatic payment conversion

If the creator collects funds in ETH and users transfer funds to them in other currencies,
such funds will be automatically converted to ETH at an exchange rate currently found on
the top exchanges, and the amount of ETH after the conversion will be credited to the
unique account of the campaign. The platform will support the maximum number of
cryptocurrencies available for automatic conversion, and their number will constantly
increase. That way, it will be as simple and convenient as possible for users to back
campaigns.

Receiving funds by creators

The funds that a campaign receives to its unique wallet are controlled by the KICKICO
platform. After a campaign is successfully completed, the funds are transferred to the
campaign creator's wallet.

Receiving funds by backers

Since campaigns can be canceled (including by creators themselves), the backers receive
their KickCoins (and/or campaigns tokens) only after campaigns are successfully
completed.

Consequently, there will be no complicated situation where backers supported some
campaign, received their KICK (and possibly campaign-speci�c tokens), but then the
campaign was canceled by the creator or banned by moderators.

Returning funds to backers

If a campaign is canceled, all raised funds, since they are stored in a smart contract
controlled by the KICKICO platform, are returned to the backers in their entirety.

OTHER
Forbidden topics and campaigns



3/21/2018 Whitepaper - KICKICO

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 37/56

Due to legal issues and the complexity of the implementation process, the platform does
not currently accept "real" money (USD or EUR). However, we will investigate this challenge,
search for options, and study the possibility of integration with already existing services to
ensure the reception of "real" money. This feature will certainly be implemented in the
future. Many users, who are completely unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and do not know
where they can be purchased, will have an opportunity to participate as backers. Thus,
KICKICO becomes a gateway to the world of ICOs and cryptocurrencies for all those who
have never dealt with them.

Comment moderation

Offensive, spamming, and �ooding comments are removed by platform moderators, and
violators themselves are deprived of the right to comment. The term of the ban on
commenting depends on the severity of the violation and can be either short-term or
permanent.

Campaign creators who publish updates on topics forbidden on the platform are deprived
of the opportunity to publish updates, and such updates will be removed.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
Smart-contracts

KickCoins are created according to the ERC20 speci�cations of the Ethereum blockchain.
Exact information about our smart contracts will be added soon - we are working on it right
now.

Safety of Funds

Platform employees do not have access to user wallets. Funds raised by campaigns and
stored in their unique wallets are controlled by the smart contracts automatically. After
fundraising is completed, all funds are automatically transferred to the wallet that is
speci�ed by the campaign creator, and 2.5 or 4% of the amount will be transferred to the
wallets of the KICKICO platform. Platform employees do not have access to unique
campaign wallets and cannot perform transfers from them.

https://www.kickico.com/whitepaper 38/56

KickCoins are generated and issued automaticall as well, and only after the receipt of
contributions to a campaign's smart-contract, be it ETH or BTC, is con�rmed. This protects
the issued KickCoins from fraud and backs all KickCoins with a real monetary value.

Users' Safety

Only account owners have access to their wallets. Passwords to accounts are not stored on
the site, with hashing used for fast login (what type and how?). Users can either store
passwords to their wallets on the platform or delete them for security reasons. In this case,
a user will have to enter the password to their wallet, which is not saved on the KICKICO
platform, for each transfer and pledge.

Links in user pro�les to social networks, emails, and other contact information are visible
only to account owners, and hidden from other users.

Only platform moderators and top-tier developers have access to links to user's linked social
networks, as well as access to their contact information. Moderators do not have access to
user wallets, their full IDs, or passwords.

Con�dentiality

Transfers made by users are recorded in the system and encrypted. User wallets are also
encrypted on the platform, and their association with user pro�les is minimized as much as
possible. Only the developers of the KICKICO platform can connect wallets to platform
users (except for creators, of course). This may be necessary to resolve disputes or answer
questions from users if they occur.

In order to ensure the safety of backers, creators who raise funds on the KICKICO platform
must be public and provide backers with information about themselves. As long as a
campaign they created is active, creators cannot turn on the anonymous mode. After a
campaign is completed, its creator can switch to anonymous mode, but the creator's public
information speci�ed by them when the campaign was launched will still be visible on the
pages of completed (including canceled) campaigns.

All personal user data, including passwords, emails, and wallet IDs, is encrypted. This
protects KICKICO users from hacking or information leaks. Even in the worst case scenario,
user data, passwords, and wallets will remain safe, since no access to them or money
transfers from them is possible.

Team

Dedicated team

My name is Anti Danilevsky and I am the founder and ideologist of KICKICO. I've specialized
in the successful implementation of crowdfunding projects for the past 7 years. As the
founder of the largest crowdfunding community in Europe, I have deep knowledge of the
thought processes of founders, investors and backers. We've seen the situation where
crowdfunding projects made beautiful promises, collected funding, and then disappeared
so many times already. It pains me so much to look at the centralized world of
crowdfunding, so when the blockchain appeared, I decided to make a move.

I've assembled a team which is motivated to make the world of crowdfunding better, and
together we want to build the �rst blockchain crowdfunding community, and offer it the
platform it deserves. This is impossible without innovating, so we need funding to develop
the codebase of community system management projects, security audits of the internal
modules, and more.

Disclaimer

This document is for information purposes only, and is not an offer or a call to sell stocks or
securities on the KICKICO platform, or that of any other related or associated company.

KickCoin tokens are not securities

User acknowledges, understands, and agrees that KickCoins are not securities and are not
registered with any government entity as a security, and shall not be considered as such.
User acknowledges, understands, and agrees that ownership of KickCoins does not grant
the user the right to receive pro�ts, income, or other payments or returns arising from the
acquisition, holding, management or disposal of, the exercise of, the redemption of, or the
expiry of, any right, interest, title or bene�t in the KICKICO or KICKICO Platform or any other
KICKICO property, whole or in part.

Absence of guarantees of income or pro�t

There is no guarantee that KickCoin tokens will grow in value. There are no guarantees that
the price of KickCoins will not decrease, including signi�cantly, due to some unforeseen
events, or events over which the developers have no control, or because of force majeure
circumstances.

Risks associated with Ethereum

KickCoin tokens will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, any failure or
malfunctioning of the Ethereum protocol may lead to the trading network of KickCoin
tokens not working as expected.

Regulatory uncertainty

Blockchain technologies are subject to supervision and control by various regulatory bodies
around the world. KickCoin tokens may fall under one or more requests or actions on their
part, including but not limited to restrictions imposed on the use or possession of digital
tokens such as KickCoins, which may slow or limit the functionality or repurchase of
KickCoin tokens in the future.

KickCoin tokens are not an investment

KickCoin tokens are not o�cial or legally binding investments of any kind. In case of
unforeseen circumstances, the objectives stated in this document may be changed. Despite
the fact that we intend to reach all goals described in this document, all persons and parties
involved in the purchase of KickCoin tokens do so at their own risk.

Quantum computers

Technical innovations, like the development of quantum computers, may pose a danger to
cryptocurrencies, including KickCoin tokens.

Risk of losing funds

Funds collected in fundraising are in no way insured. If they are lost or lose their value, there
is no private or public insurance representative that buyers can reach out to.

Returning funds

If a campaign does not end successfully, or is canceled by its creator, or by moderators, the
funds are returned to the wallets of those users who transferred funds to the wallet of the
campaign. If the user made their payment in a �at currency (USD, EUR, RUR, or any other),
the funds are returned to their ETH wallet inside the KICKICO system. The user can
withdraw this ETH or use them to participate in any other campaign launched on the
KICKICO platform.

Risks of using new technologies

KickCoin tokens are a new and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks
mentioned in this document, there are certain additional risks that the team of the KICKICO
platform cannot foresee. These risks may manifest themselves in other forms of risk than
those speci�ed herein.

Crowdinvesting

The KICKICO platform disclaims any and all responsibility or liability in relation to any
obligations made by creators of crowdinvesting campaigns to investors who bought their
tokens on the KICKICO platform. The KICKICO platform is just an intermediary between
creators of such campaigns and their investors. The function of the KICKICO platform is
only to transfer funds from investors to creators, and tokens of crowdinvesting campaign
creators to investors. KICKICO does not guarantee the claims made by campaign creators.
