Abstract

Introduction

It only takes a brief look at the cryptocurrency 
market capitalization charts over the course of the 
past year to see  that the majority of these 
currencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero 
and other major cryptocurrencies — show 
significant growth in value and are expected to 
see significant growth in the future, reflecting both 
a loss of faith in traditional money systems and a 
growing confidence in the power of blockchain 
technology. 

However these cryptocurrencies are not proving 
to be very e�ective as payment instruments; their 
growth in value has caused them to behave more 
like assets than currency, so investors and miners 
are holding cryptocurrencies rather than using 
them to purchase goods and services . Users have 
no incentive to trade or sell them, since once they 
are traded, owners lose their investment position. 

The solution is a credit model in which volatile 
crypto-assets act as collateral while credit is 
granted in a stable currency. 

This system allows borrowers to gain profits from 
their assets as the market rises, while reducing risk 
to credit providers and borrowers if the market 
falls.

Platforms that attempt to intermediate 
cryptocurrency-backed loans between individual 
lenders and borrowers usually fail to provide the 
service of proper risk management to their clients; 
price volatility of the collateral creates a 
burdensome risk to both the borrower and lender.  
At the other end of the spectrum, most established 
lending channels are unwilling to accept volatile 
assets such as cryptocurrency as collateral at all.

MoneyToken aims to resolve these issues, 
managing clients’ risks and creating a stable 
lending model using cryptocurrencies as a 
security deposit.  Our model aims to facilitate 
access to credit while building a new credit market 
– loans backed by crypto collateral, based on the 
security and transparency of  blockchain 
technology.

Since the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the 
behaviour of users, owners and miners has proved 
to be very di�erent than what was expected. 
Rather than turning into true ‘virtual coinage 
systems’ used to buy goods and services on a 
day-to-day basis (from your morning latte to 
houses and cars), Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies have turned into long-term 
investments; from something you keep in your 
wallet into something you store in your safe.

Nobody now would suggest buying pizza with 
Bitcoins as happened back on May 22nd, 2010 
(Bitcoin Pizza Day) when a developer bought 2 
Papa John’s pizzas with 10,000 units of  BTC. "It 
wasn't like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the 
idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly 
cool," Hanyecz told The New York Times in 2013. 
"No one knew it was going to get so big."

On the other hand, quickly appreciating assets, 
which cryptocurrencies have proven to be, have 
become a valuable asset for lending and crediting.

The market for this type of platform will typically 
consist of miners, projects that received funds from 
Token sales, cryptocurrency exchangers and 
providers of services for cryptocurrency 
purchases. In addition, early cryptocurrency 
traders with significant paper gains will also find it 
enticing.

Going back to the famous Papa John’s pizza order. 
Today, ten thousand Bitcoins would be worth over 
$50 million. If all you had in the ‘bank’ was Bitcoins, 
you could still order that pizza - just take out a loan 
via the MoneyToken.com platform, deposit 127,601 
Satoshi, order and eat your pizza, pay back the 
loan in USD, and maintain your Bitcoin asset 
position without loss.

Our Vision

Bank

Insurance Company Evaluator

Collection Agency Verification Agency LenderBorrower

At this stage of the market’s development, we see 
that cryptocurrency assets have gained the 
characteristics of various financial instruments. We 
can divide cryptocurrencies by their qualities and 
algorithms; into investment assets and means of 
payment. 

Investment assets are volatile and 
compelling for the long term, made to earn on 
the di�erence between rates of exchange or 
getting other types of earnings, such as from 
proof-of-stake algorithms, rate in interest and 
so on. 

Payment cryptocurrencies are created to 
support the stability of the rate of exchange – 
they usually are embedded with a 
self-regulation mechanism, a unique 
algorithm to regulate the di�culty of mining 
or the release of new coins.

The problem is that, even if the new functional 
cryptocurrency has a capitalization of several 
million, it’s probably not recognized by the 
pre-existing fiat financial system as an asset. Even 
if on the governmental level the cryptocurrency 
has a certain status, the banking system and its 
loan services are closed for the cryptocurrency 
business or the holders of such an asset.

In the majority of banks, it’s impossible to acquire a 
loan for the development of a mining farm using 
cryptocurrency as collateral.

We see that one of the main functions of banks and 
lending institutions in the current fiat system of 
loans secured by collateral is assigning value to 
the assets and businesses of borrowers to 
minimize the risks of default on debt. A secondary, 
but still very important, function (often delegated to 
other institutions) is  the verification of assets, 
individuals and businesses; the realization of 
assets; and the collection of debts and dues.

None of these functions are essential in a 
blockchain-based credit system, in which the 
value of the collateral asset at any moment is 
public and the credit terms are transparent and 
fixed in a smart contract; no intermediaries are 
needed besides the link ensuring the completion 
of the transaction and the smart contract. 

Under the conditions of a cryptocurrency 
economy, banks and contract participants’ 
competencies can easily be eliminated by smart 
contracts, the cost of a loan lowered and the 
conditions of applying for a loan can finally be 
made transparent to all parties.

Reserve funds, funds that guarantee investments, 
banking deposits and government guarantees are 
created to neutralize the risks of economic turmoil, 
mass default on debt, as well as to guarantee the 
safety of funds and the earnings of creditors.
 

While the blockchain technology allows for getting 
rid of all the intermediaries in the loan system, 
automatic control of risks is a primary advantage of 
the MoneyToken platform.

The list of the advantages of this model versus traditional banking or pawnbrokers’ schemes:

Automatic confirmation of the loan within  seconds or minutes.

No requirement for credit scoring or verification of assets.

The customer regulates the loan conditions on their own within the confines of the platform’s terms.

An option to deposit the collateral in several cryptocurrency assets in order to stabilize the general fluctuation 
of the collateral and lower any upward pressure on interest rates.

Transparency of the operation during both transfer and retention of the security deposit.

Transparency of collateral evaluation and the fluctuation of its value over time for both parties.

Lending Model

Interest rates for this type of loan can be settled using the collateral value or paid o� in crypto- or fiat currency, in 
which case the security deposit will be returned immediately after the settlement.

Why would Mike turn to MoneyToken?

What if the Bitcoin rate of exchange drops?

How It Works: Miner Mike’s Case

Mike knows that if he takes out a loan, collateralized with assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum — in return he will receive 
an agreed loan amount in a stable currency.

And after loan repayment he will receive his whole collateral back even if collateral has many times increased in value. 

This way, he’s able to acquire liquid funds, save his crypto position and stay in the investment game in the long run. 

With MoneyToken, there is no reason to sell your BTC when you need liquid funds.

The loan funds are backed by the collateral. A repayment-to-collateral (RtC) ratio of 30% to 70% can be set by the 
client. The 50% ratio is considered optimal based on retrospective analysis of Bitcoin fluctuations.

Let’s say Mike, the owner of a mining farm, has an urgent need to grow his capacity and plans to purchase some 
equipment worth $500,000. Mike might sell his Bitcoins and receive the sum in fiat currency, or even buy the 
equipment in Bitcoin, in which case he’s lost his investment position.



7Platform for Smart Loans Backed by Crypto-Assets

When applying for a loan, Mike can set the ratio of credit to collateral to 30% and lower the risks of RtC growing 
to a critical value.

Mike can deposit the collateral in several cryptocurrencies at the same time. This way, the more stable 
crypto-assets will compensate for the volatility of the others.

How can Mike secure himself and diversify the risks?

Introducing Amanda

In the event that the RtC ratio growths higher than 95%, the system automatically cashes out a part of the collateral to 
pay back the loan and returns the remaining collateral funds to user.

To the borrower, it looks like the automated Stop Loss was triggered.

With the fall of collateral market value Stop Loss can occur.

Prior to Stop Loss, the borrower will have the following options:

Increase the amount of collateral with additional amount of crypto-currency.

Repay part of the loan debt ahead of schedule.

Pay o� the loan, by liquidating (selling) part of the collateral at the current market price. The remaining part of the 
deposit will be returned to user’s account.

To do nothing.

Behind MoneyToken is Amanda. Amanda is an Artificial Intelligence Assistant 
who will provide automated loan operations on the platform.

Besides the assistant function, Amanda acts as a true AI, analyzing the client by their 
first steps on the platform to make conclusions and o�er them extra financial 
services that will most likely interest them, she also helps with tracking collateral, 
repaying the loan, just like a real bank manager would, but all based on data. 

Amanda is powered by a deep learning AI algorithm, and her goal is to provide 
human-like services for the platform users. This assistant will change the way 
people think about banking. No more shady managers, hidden commissions, “small 
fonts” in contracts, and troubles with transaction support.



8Platform for Smart Loans Backed by Crypto-Assets

Technical Description of the Platform
MoneyToken will use Ethereum-based smart contracts to secure the terms of the agreement.

Collateral funds will be deposited in protected multi-signature wallets requiring 3/4 signatures to access. One 
signature is owned by the borrower at all times, one owned by the lender, 3rd and 4th are owned by the 
MoneyToken arbitration service.

Multichain transactions and contracts will be available in the future, making MoneyToken a fully decentralized 
platform.

Loan Repayment and Collateral Refund
After the loan is repaid, the user is returned a security deposit to his blockchain address.

Types of Loan Repayment:

1. Repayment is subdivided by the time factor:

Repayment on time

Early repayment

2. Early repayment is divided by the quantitative factor:

Full early repayment

Partial early repayment

3. And also by the way of repayment:

Repayment by means of the same currency in which the loan was issued (standard method).

Repayment with the help of collateral by transferring a proportional amount of collateral to the address of the 
platform. The remaining amount of collateral after loan repayments is transferred to the address of the borrower.

Repayments with the help of other cryptocurrency assets.

Credit Flow
The borrower can withdraw the loan currency from the system for use.

The borrower is able to repay the loan ahead of time.

The borrower may be able to partially repay the loan ahead of schedule.

On the last day of the loan, the borrower may have the opportunity to extend the loan by making an additional 
deposit.

The main point that smart contracts are not as smart today as many cryptocurrency holders are thinking. For example, 
Ethereum smart contract can’t control the deals in which other cryptocurrencies are involved, like BTC or BCH. Also, smart 
contract won’t work as the events happen automatically. It needs to be activated manually, or by a back-end script as the 
oracle is triggered. Many users are not aware of this, and believe that a smart contract is an automated contract that can 
independently control a deal, and that it solves the trust issue. Unfortunately, Ethereum is just not there yet. Therefore, until 
a self-su�cient cross-chain technology appears, smart contract cannot automatically control the deal.  

Consequently, the issue of trust on our platform will be resolved not via the smart contracts, but via multi-signature 
addresses: separate ones for BTC, ETH and other currencies. 

1 signature - the Borrower

1 signature - the Lender

2 signatures - MoneyToken as an Escrow agent 

3 out of 4 signatures are required. 

We don’t use the 2 signatures out of 3 and safekeep the 2 signatures at MoneyToken so that the same person couldn’t 
create several accounts as a Lender and a Borrower to make a deal and cheat the platform. 
In case of the 3 out of 4 signatures required, none of the parties can take over the funds, and no factor of trust is needed.

Repayment of a Loan

In the event that the borrower pays out the loan and returns the loan funds within the timeframe fixed in the contract, 
the security deposit must be unlocked and transferred to the borrower's address.

In the event that the borrower does not repay the loan in time and fails to fulfill the obligations fixed in the contract, part 
of the pledge funds in the equivalent of repayment amount must be unlocked and transferred to the address of the 
platform. The platform can utilize a part of the collateral to pay damages caused by non-fulfillment of contract terms by 
the borrower. The borrower will receive back the remainder of the collateral.

In the event that the borrower's collateral starts depreciating and its estimated value approaches the value of the loan, 
if it was provided for by the terms of the  contract, the borrower deposits additional collateral or repays part of the loan 
ahead of time to reduce the collateral load. 

If the borrower does not do this and the borrower's collateral continues to decrease in value (lifetime of the contract 
before the return of the loan), part of the security deposit in the equivalent of the repayment amount must be unlocked 
and transferred to the address of the platform. The platform can release part of the collateral to pay damages caused 
by non-fulfillment of contract terms by the borrower. The borrower will receive back the remainder of the collateral.

Loan parameters

Loan parameters may include, for example:

Loan currency;

Collateral currency;

Loan amount (La);

Duration of credit in days (d);

Interest rate (p) per day;

Repayment To Collateral Ratio (RtC), which a�ects the calculated value of the pledge.

The calculated parameters include:

Collateral Currencies
At the time of the platform’s launch, Bitcoin and Ethereum will be accepted as collateral, these being the two 
cryptocurrencies with the biggest market capitalization.

Dash, Litecoin and other popular cryptocurrencies that are among the top 10 most capitalized will be added as 
collateral cryptocurrencies in the third release of the platform.

Adding other popular Token sales tokens that have gained enough trust on the market and are backed by a  
working successful product, will be considered as collateral currencies in the future.

The interest of the service (I), calculated by the formula

Loan repayment amount (Ra), calculated by the formula

The amount of collateral (Ca), calculated by the formula

I= La×p×d

Ra= La+I

Ca= Ra÷RtC×100

What Can You Do With Stablecoins?

Convert them to USD via exchanges.

Fiat funds can be released in a variety of ways – straight to a bank card, via SEPA, SWIFT and other payment 
networks. The method of payment may vary depending on the borrower’s location. Also, MTC and USDT will be 
eligible for exchange to fiat currencies and crypto-assets through brokers’ platforms and exchange services.

Use it for buying crypto-assets and token sales tokens.

The user can build a portfolio of cryptocurrencies and promising token sales.

Use via the MoneyToken debit card.

Users can keep the loan funds inside the service and use them on demand via the MoneyToken debit card.

Note: MoneyToken debit cards will be integrated into the platform in second release of the platform in Q4 2018.

Tether

Loan Currencies
The goal of MoneyToken’s clients will be to obtain liquid funds in either fiat currencies (USD for example) or in stable 
cryptocurrencies that are more suitable for purchasing goods and   services (stablecoins).

The most convenient option at the moment is USD Tether. The rate of exchange for USDT stays stable in comparison 
to Bitcoin, and it is easily exchanged for dollars as it’s already backed by collateral in dollars. Tether is being accepted 
for deals on the majority of cryptocurrency brokers’ boards.
 
Tether’s market capitalization has grown from about $55 million in April 2017 to $430 million in September 2017, an 
increase of 781%.

MTC
MTC is a stable ERC-20 token on the MoneyToken platform used as a credit currency for loans or exchanged for fiat 
money. 1 MTC = 1 USD. The amount of issued MTC will be covered by CDP (Crypto Collateralized Debt Positions) or the 
equal balance of USD on the platform’s bank accounts.

DAI
Currently there are several decentralized stable or inflationary cryptocurrency projects, such as Dai from MakerDAO.

Such cryptocurrencies can become a future means of settlement and a replacement for fiat money, which means that 
they will be favourable for lending backed by deflationary cryptocurrencies.

If these platforms are successfully launched and credibility is established in the market, these cryptocurrencies will 
also be available on the MoneyToken platform as credit currencies.

Properties of the MTC token are akin to USDT, but MTC can be converted to USD directly at the internal MoneyToken 
exchange point. This simplifies the exchange to fiat currencies for users.

Note: MTC as a loan currency is planned to be integrated into the platform in Phase 3 of the release in Q1 2019.

MTC is an ERC-20 token so users will be able to:

Transfer MTC to their Ethereum ERC-20 wallets and keep them outside of the service

Transfer them between other users of MTC

Use them for trading on brokers’ platforms or exchange them for other crypto-assets at exchange points.



MoneyToken Exchange
At the MoneyToken exchange service, users will be able to purchase and exchange cryptocurrency assets, as well as 
fiat funds.

MoneyToken exchange will be used for automation collateral liquidation in cases of collateral currencies price drop.

MoneyToken Ecosystem
Initial Money Token (IMT) 
The solution that we have developed to minimize the risks, both for the platform itself and its users – a token with a 
specific functionality.

IMT tokens can be purchased during the Token sale for $0,005. After the Token sale IMTs will be available for 
purchase in Retail Sale. 

The Retail price of IMT inside our platform will be $0,05, it is 10 times higher than the token sale price, it will be 
increasing over time and never lower than the token sale price.

The funds received from the Retail sales of IMT will be transferred to the MoneyToken safety fund to protect lenders 
interests.

Token Functions

Privileged terms for platform users when depositing IMT to receive Borrower Membership. 

Up to 60% discount on the platform fees for Borrower Membership. 

When using the discount from the user’s balance, the equivalent of 50% of the discount in USD is charged in IMT 
tokens. 

The opportunity to become a lender when depositing IMT for Lender Membership.

IMT’s properties

The supply of IMT is limited 

Additional mining is prohibited

11Platform for Smart Loans Backed by Crypto-Assets

USD, EUR, JPY and other fiat currencies

Fiat currencies will be available for borrowers to choose from. MoneyToken will obtain all necessary finance 
licenses to issue fiat loans. Look for the detailed information in the Road Map.

BTC, ETH and other volatile currencies

If clients desire, they will be able to obtain a loan in volatile currency, like BTC or ETH, also using BTC/ETH as a 
collateral for this loan. 

In this case, loan and repayment amount will be fixed in the USD equivalent, with an option to repay the loan with 
BTC/ETH/other cryptocurrencies.

It could be convenient for the client if he wants to participate in the Token Sale which accepts only ETH, BTC, or 
to pay for some services/equipment, or it will be convenient if client’s contractors accept only volatile assets and 
not fiat currency, which is quite common on the cryptocurrency market.

At the launching stage of the platform, as we’re one of the pioneers in this field and the competition is virtually 
non-existent, we’re fixating the following conditions that may change in the future:

0,2% a day for short-term loans from 5 to 90 days, 

10%/year for long-term loans from 6 months to 2 years

But later fees and deal conditions will be formed by the market, by borrowers and lenders so it could be changed in 
the future.

Goals:

The MVP sandbox of the first version of the platform will be available in the first quarter of 2018.

Expanding to Western, European and Asian markets, acquiring marketing metrics and fine-tuning the business 
development processes.

Optimizing the crediting model and managing the risks inside the market model.

Attracting lenders for the expansion of the MoneyToken credit fund.

MoneyToken’s Development
Stage 1. Automated lending platform — Q1 2018

With an optimized model of managing assets and the administration in the fourth quarter of 2018, in order to expand 
the project’s fund, MoneyToken’s outside lenders will be involved.

Goal: optimizing the financial and the business models to convert to decentralized B2B crediting models in various 
jurisdictions.

The MoneyToken API will be developed. Major cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services will be able to use the 
MoneyToken widget on their sites to arbitrate loans to their customers.

Stage 2. Lender membership — Q4 2018

Any financial or lending organization will be able to connect to the MoneyToken platform as a lender, allowing further 
contribution in the MoneyToken credit fund and using the platform functionality on the favourable conditions.

In order to connect to the platform, the lender will need to purchase IMT tokens. The quantity of IMTs required for 
getting lender status will be defined later and may vary depending on the sum the lender wants to contribute into the 
credit fund.

All processes on the platform will be automated according to market analysis and mechanisms.

Stage 3. Decentralized B2B2C Network — Q2 2019

MoneyToken API

The credit fund regulates and influences the maximum possible amount of loans that the platform can give out.

After the Token Sale stage, the lending portfolio of MoneyToken will include a total of $20+ million and continue to 
grow through contributions from early- and late-stage partners as the platform expands and scales.

MoneyToken Credit Fund

a percentage reserved from the profits of every credit deal;

a percentage reserved from contributions attracted to the Token sale;

funds which will be received by the Platform from the Retail sale.

In order to level out any risks tied to a possible rapid drop of the collateral currencies’ value in comparison to the value 
of the loans given out, or di�culties in processing of the collateral asset, a MoneyToken safety fund will be created.

The safety fund portfolio will consist of:

MoneyToken Safety Fund

The MoneyToken Decentralized Exchange will be launched. This option will be implemented in the 4th release of the 
platform due to the Roadmap.

MoneyToken exchange will also be used for automated collateral liquidation in case of collateral currencies̀  price drop.

Decentralized Exchange launch

Compliance and Legal
The legal entity, Money Token Limited, is registered in United Kingdom, which has a strong reputation and is widely 
known as a global FinTech leader.

Money Token Limited is an operational legal entity which will be used for obtaining financial licences and signing 
contracts with fiat payment providers and partners to issue loans in fiat currencies.

Money Token Limited - the operating company for loans in fiat currencies

The legal entity, Elam Enterpises LTD, is registered in BVI jurisdiction.

This company is  responsible for conducting the Token Sale and issuing loans in cryptocurrencies.

Elam Enterpises LTD - the operating company for token sale and 
cryptocurrency loans.

The exchange service of the platform will allow the  purchase, sale or trade of credit cryptocurrencies with fiat money. 
The trades will be executed via the processing center-partner that handles all fiat transactions.

All users who want to use this “cryptocurrency trade to fiat feature” will be required to pass the KYC/AML assessment.

Exchange service and interaction with fiat finances

MoneyToken has 2 target audiences:

We use 2 legal entities for our operational activities
BVI company is sought to conduct the Token sale and to provide loans in cryptocurrrency. 

UK company is approached for loans in fiat currency.

Audience requiring fiat loans

A significant part of the MoneyToken's customers needs loans in fiat to spend credit funds in the "o�ine" world. 
MoneyToken's planning to register as a legal entity in every country to be able to operate in them and obtain the 
required licenses to give out FIAT loans. 

Therefore, MoneyToken will have several legal entities and a general global holding. 

MoneyToken is first and foremost interested in the Asian market: China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam. MoneyToken is going 
to begin with those countries, afterwards adding Europe and the US, Canada. Evidently, Asia currently holds a big 
part of the cryptocurrency capitals. In Europe we only need to obtain a single license in UK to operate over the 
whole Europe.

A part of the cryptocurrency market is located in the US, and although it's significantly smaller than Asian, MoneyTo-
ken is going to launch fiat loans there too.

Audience requiring cryptocurrency loans 

The second target audience of MoneyToken is customers interested in cryptocurrency loans (USDT/-
DAI/BTC/ETH/BCH) backed by a collateral in crypto (BTC/ETH/BCH), since people also need credit funds to use 
inside the crypto market, for example:

Pay for marketing;

Pay for development;

Invest credit funds in alt-coins;

Pay for mining equipment.

MoneyToken considers this group as the main audience of the platform, because they are usually interested in larger 
loans (from $50,000 to $2,000,000). Plus, the cryptocurrency market is becoming wider and wider every day. 

With the global spread of cryptocurrencies, in the next 15 years, crypto loans may replace fiat loans entirely and 
become the main type of credits given out by MoneyToken. 

Cryptocurrency-backed loans are already available at account.moneytoken.com.



Legal Status of the IMT Token
IMT tokens are utility tokens.

IMT tokens do not share the properties of paper securities.

To ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) policies, Know Your Client (KYC) procedures will be 
implemented.
