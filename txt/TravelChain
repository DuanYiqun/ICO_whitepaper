TravelChain /  3

/ Key Market Challenges

Travel market is an industry with a customer's life cycle averaged about 
half of a year. However, these days the majority of business community is 
aware of a customer only when he or she comes to the final stage of 
making a purchase decision — booking tickets, tours, hotel, etc. 

In other circumstances, marketing specialists work almost blindfolded 
trying to guess what travelers would prefer. Furthermore, the business 
community loses track of customers after they have made their purchase 
and spends more money to attract new ones. 

Personal data is the key corporate strength and “the oil of the 21st 
century”. However, only 20% of such data is publicly available, the rest 80% 
circulates within corporate systems: Google, Apple, Amazon1, and other 
major players in the area of interest.. 

Small and medium business have no access to this kind of information. In 
addition, customers  normally have no means to control their data transition 
and do not benefit from the data being used be the third parties. 

In this context, users are willing to submit their personal information by 
themselves2 to ensure they receive custom-designed offers in accordance 
with their personal preferences.

/ Data Use Potential

It is obvious that the future belongs to platforms that are capable of 
collecting and structuring any data. Artificial Intelligence applications will 
be able to use collected and stored  data to anticipate user preferences and 
provide accurate recommendations. 

The more data, the smarter are the algorithms that will eventually be able 
to foresee the wishes we are yet unable to predict for ourselves. 

Just imagine a global database that contains the most comprehensive 
and unbiased information about suppliers and customers of the travel 
market. Access to this database is granted not only to major corporations, 
but small and medium business representatives and the most gifted 
developers worldwide can also get access to it 

It is possible to create such a database utilizing blockchain technologies. 
Ultimately, we will have a system with low entry barriers which will allow 
every participant on the market to invest into in order to develop its 
infrastructure. On top of that, none of the platform operators will have full 
control over the system



TravelChain /  4

We are willing to provide equal access to all players for data exchange and 
give control of personal data back to users so that they can handle and 
manage it by themselves.  

That is why we create TravelChain — a decentralized platform for data 
exchange in the travel market where users submit their personal 
information and receive a benefit  for it. This is a public open source block 
chain under management of the EcoSystem's users. 

We believe that with further improvement certain breakthrough solutions 
will occur in order to establish new standards of how people will be 
traveling in the nearest future. 

We call it Smart Traveling

/ Data in TravelChain

Using TravelChain-driven services, applications or plugins, every user has 
an option to share his or her personal data within the community. 

TravelChain allows information storage with-in the 
following industry sectors: 
• Transaction history 
• Review and feedback 
• Reviewed and purchased tours 
• Movements and visited places 
• Accommodation 
• Locations 
• Activities 
• Events 
• Services 
• Commodities 
• User personal information 

User’s personal information stored: 
• Content, based on the personal experience 

(guidelines, lifehacks, reviews etc.) 
• Personal and contact information 
• Interests 
• Search history 
• Social connections 
• Other information which can be valuable 

for business 

Public information is stored in open form. 
On the other hands, users can control all their 
personal information in encrypted form. 

TravelTokens value will increase in accordance 
to the growth of the stored data amount within the system. When critical 
mass of users will be reached, the chain effect will occur which will lead to a 
drastic growth of the ecosystem.  

In the nearest future, all data used within travel industry may be stored 
inside TravelChain. Today, in cooperation with scientists from the 
Novosibirsk State University we design standards of storing decentralized 
travel data published in the documents “Ontology” and “Technical Paper”.

/ Using TravelToken

TravelToken is a fuel for the ecosystem of TravelChain Smart Traveling  

TravelToken is used to: 

• get personal user information 
• create and submit adverts 
• gain authority in the community and opportunity to make decisions 
• upgrade an account from basic to temporary or lifetime  
• be nominated to the Decentralized Management 
• pay for extra services provided by reputation agencies  

pay for extra services provided by computer-aided education tools and 
AI 

• pay for transport services, accommodation and entertainment during 
traveling, provided by companies and leisure travelers 

• pay fees of more than 20 various operations (see Technical Paper for 
details); 

The more users are presented, the more data and demand for

/ Example of Traveling with TravelChain

Using TravelChain enables the industry to step forth to a new level of 
customization. Let’s have a look at what can trips be like in the nearest 
future. 

Preparation 
A few months ago, you became aware of the entire ecosystem of Travel-

Chain applications. Using these applications, you filled up the global 
knowledge database of travel industry and shared personal information. 
 

When your personal information is used, you receive TravelTokens and 
accumulate sufficient amount to go to the journey of your dream. Moreover, 
the TravelChain now has sufficient information to comprehend  your wishes 
in more optimal way. 

Travel Planning 
One day, you open one of the TravelChain applications and get your 

personal advert from your dream hotel located in Cuba. This advert 
describes your dream in details — there’s the sea within 50 meters of the 
hotel — what a great opportunity for you to go kiting! Moreover, there is a 
small yoga studio located beside a cliff with beautiful view on the 
mountains, and on top of that, windows in your room are located on both 
sides with a magnificent views.  

You have never told anyone about your dream, in fact, you did not realize 
it for yourself but this is it. It is out of the question that you have to seize it. 
The application suggests the best dates for you to visit this place, so that 
your kiting session won’t be spoiled by a hurricane.  

Booking 
You click "Order" button and the system requests access to your personal 

data: phone number, email, passport details, etc. You agree and in a few 
seconds you receive the tickets that are already filled in for you — the only 
thing you still have to do is to confirm payment with a single click. 

After your transaction is confirmed, you will receive a message suggesting 
the list of items you should take with you. Therefore all companies and 3rd 
parties that guarantee your journey will receive  the information about your 
preferences which agreed to be shared. In this context, they would be 
prepared for your visit and offer you best services, specifically designed to 
meet  your demands. 

Journey 
During your stay in the hotel of your dream in Cuba, you keep receiving 

offers, that provide you money and pleasure of the idea that your desires 
are really fulfilled. This time you are offered to rent a bike at a favorable 
price and pay it on the spot using TravelToken. This is very tempting for you 



/ Example of Traveling with TravelChain TravelChain /  8

since it seems suitable and safe, and what is more important the bike 
should be inspected since there is insufficient feedback on it.  

After examining the bike, you draw up a rental agreement and pay it by 
holding your phone to the bike owner’s phone. After a few seconds, the 
money is transferred and you have the bike rented without any papers. You 
think it is very handy and start traveling around the island using knowledge 
provided by those who submitted relevant information to TravelChain in 
your  language. Really handy, you must have thought.  

This way traveling with TravelChain will exceed your expectations. 



TravelChain /  9

/ Direct Adverts

In the previous case we have mentioned Direct Adverts. In this section, we 
would like to discuss them in more details. 

TravelChain enables an opportunity to send and receive direct adverts.   

Messages will be sent only in case if user agreed to receive them. Any 
user can specify minimum cost for an advert by stating a minimum fee, 
which he or she agrees to receive in return for reviewing this ad from an 
advertiser in the network. 

In return, companies receive via TravelChain all the data required in order 
to create a custom advert: personal data and preferences, previous travel 
information etc. In several cases, recent information (e.g. GPS data) can also 
be collected. 

As an example, the restaurant can send adverts only to users staying 
nearby and whose preferences represents their affinity to Italian cuisine. 
User can see the direct advert in all application within the marketing 
network. 

Direct Adverts are extremely profitable for business representatives in 
comparison to Mass Adverts. Therefore, user will receive not only an offer 
suitable for him or her but also a reward. 



TravelChain /  10

/ Platform Roles

There are the following roles at the TravelChain platform: 

Users/companies 

• Service/information consumers 
• Service/information providers 

The above roles can be associated with companies or users who acquire 
information from other players or provide it. The same account can be both 
a seller and a buyer of information. Two profiles can be created using one 
account: both as an individual and a company.  

Users have full control of access to personal data and receive compen-
sation when their data is used. In addition, they obtain new level services 
based on individual recommendations: 

1. Offers created after reviewing the user interests and best market 
offers; 

2. "Smart" selection of news feed and search inquiries; 
3. Unified profile and source of social ties (e.g. friends, subscriptions) 

regardless of an application in use. 

Companies receive User's data in order to solve their business objectives. 

Services   
Information brokers between buyers and sellers of information can provide 

previously processed data and help communicating with API TravelChain.  

Application and web-services developers do not use resources to collect 
data and create content. By using access to TravelChain database, they can 
focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and high-quality applications — 
both for travelers and travel service providers.  

Using TravelChain, application developers are granted access to: 
• Shared database; 
• Global service catalogue; 
• Transactions and user preferences; 
• Global ranking of service providers; 
• Consumers concerns; 
• Opportunity to develop algorithms that offer more comprehensive 

background for leisure travelers  

AI creators can submit their algorithms or processed data to developers. 
This can be paid either on contract basis  or  using TravelToken in case the 
agreement between sides is reached by this ensuring an extra flow of 
tokens within the system. 



/ Platform Roles TravelChain /  11

Decentralized Administration 
Decentralized Administration is formed by the network participants. 

Every user can suggest his or her promotion into Decentralized 
Administration and the suggestion will either be accepted or rejected by 
the community. Every user within TravelChain can give his or her vote to 
one of other users or withdraw it in real-time.  

The administration is formed with: 

Technical Supervisors (Delegates) 
To be elected by TravelToken owners, according to the principle of 

delegated democracy. They take care of TravelChain software performance 
at their servers and receive compensation in TravelTokens for their work 
(see Technical Paper for details). 

Economic Supervisors (the Committee) 
Manage economic features of a blockchain without changing a source 

code acting in accordance to community’s interests.  

The Committee members can manage some of the parameters within the 
system. Unlike Delegates, they do not need special software. All changes 
are applied without system reboot. 

For more detailed information, please see the Technical paper.

/ TravelChain Business Model

Key factors affecting our business model: 

TravelChain: Key Partners: 

• Owners of applications and web services able to embed their services into 
TravelChain or create new ones using this platform 

• Advertising networks capable of embedding TravelChain marketing 
opportunities to their business processes 

• Travel companies of any scale 
• All industry players providing their services to travelers: individual 

entrepreneurs, hotels, airlines, bus and railroad carriers, sightseeing 
agencies, etc. 

The TravelChain core value — is to provide companies with the personal 
user information that he or she agrees to share. In this way: 
• Traveling will be more affordable; 
• companies will be able to cut   their expenses for marketing and make 

individual offers to travelers; 
• users will be compensated for using data and viewing target messages. 

Therefore, TravelChain acts as a broker between  data sellers and buyers, 
thus ensuring technical capability, friendliness, transparency, and safety of 
transactions. 

Key activities is what we are focused on in the first place:  
• Enhance methods for data acquisition and constant increase of a number 

of applications working in the TravelChain ecosystem; 
• Structure data being acquired and extend number of relevant classes; 
• Increase data demand and attract partners interested to use it; 
• Increase number of advertising space (both individual applications and 

advertising networks; 
• Advertising demand growth via TravelChain ecosystem. 

Major costs of TravelChain: 
• Compensation of TravelChain core team; 
• Compensation of delegates who ensure network performance; 

Other essential expenditures: costs for registering user accounts and data 
funded from the Digital Development Fund (see details below). 

The main source of TravelChain income is the fees received from 
transactions within the system and fixed issue to the community reserve 
fund. 



TravelChain /  13

/ Voting

A principle of delegated democracy is in effect within the platform. All 
TravelToken owners without limitation have a voting right within the Travel-
Chain platform. The more TravelTokens in possession of an owner, the more 
weight of his or her vote.  

Members can use their votes independently to make any administrative 
decisions within the community or assign them to any other user with 
delegation of decision-making rights on his or her behalf.  

By means of continuous voting, token owners manage: 
• Composition of technical supervisors 
• Composition of economic supervisors 
• Distribution of the Digital Development Fund 
• Making any decisions raised by the community members for the general 

voting 
 

See Technical Paper for details of voting types.

TravelChain /  14

/ Issuing and TravelToken Circulation

Issue is set at 10% per year. This size will allow to engage additional means 
for development and will not be crucial for users who purchased Travel-
Tokens earlier. The overall issue proceeds to the community reserve fund 
and remains under relevant control. The daily digital development fund and 
technical network supervisors are paid from the reserve fund.  

Due to the fact that TravelTokens proceed to the Development Fund on a 
regular basis, the number of users increases with subsequent growth of 
demand in data and TravelTokens.   

TravelTokens from the daily digital development fund proceed to users; 
they make some actions within the platform and receive compensation for 
it. Once again, TravelTokens proceed to the community reserve fund, and 
thus the circulation of economic system is triggered.

/ Digital Development Fund

Part of the daily pool within the Digital Development Fund is allocated for 
platform development.  

For instance, Decentralized Administration can suggest funding 
acquisition of user movement information by allocating some of the daily 
pool of the Digital Development Fund to respective applications.The 
community makes the final decision whether to accept the suggestion or 
not. 

Every player can make a claim for funding from the Digital Development 
Fund if he or she propose relevant plan and request support from the 
community. If the community approves the development plan, in this case 
this player will be funded in TravelTokens following the schedule specified in 
the plan.  

Funding can be withheld at any time if the player does not adhere to the 
plan or this plan proves to be inefficient. Decentralized Management and 
the community stakeholders monitor the progress of the development plan 
based on KPI.  



TravelChain /  16

/ Distribution

Participation in Token Sale is forbidden for US, China and Singapore 
residents. 

The number of TravelTokens issued will be 2,100,000,000 units that will be 
allocated based on the results of Token preSale and Token Sale: 

TravelToken is being created on the base of the TravelChain blockchain. 
Transfer and trading of tokens will be available after the TokenSale ends. 

Command tokens (13.8%) will be blocked for 12 months by TravelChain 
software and later deblocked in equal amounts within this period.  

Development Fund tokens (30%) are intended for sale to large-scale 
travel industry players. They will be transferred to a multisignature account 
with two signatures, each having an equal weight, and one of which will be 
controlled by a third-party escrow and the second one by TravelChain team. 
Tokens can be deblocked only when KPI reaches 100,000 ecosystem users. 

We sell 30% of TravelTokens to large industry players to ensure success 
of the project. 

In order to make TravelChain a standard for the industry we have to attract 
maximum number of travel market players to the platform, in particular, 
large companies. These companies will be provided with special conditions 
ensuring their entry. 

In order to retain the flexibility while attracting partners, we reserve some 
tokens for sale to institutional investors. The quicker they enter the project, 
the more data is presented at the platform and faster it will grow.
