This is re�ected heavily in this White Paper, which you will 
soon notice has much more about the underlying business 
driving the tokens and their value than most o�erings (are 
able to) provide. 

When DRG go live, the  Dragon Platform will quickly have a 
very healthy daily transactional �ow. Within only a few weeks, 
the Dragon Platform will be cryptographically hosting a major 
business with an expected turnover of US$250 million a day.

Set out in the pages that follow are the details of this and how 
we intend to build a global business with well over what is 
considered an economically necessary critical mass of 
transactional �ows created by DRG holders as members of the 
international Dragon Community.

We sincerely hope that you will gain a good understanding of 
the current problem and how the application of our no-frills 
Fintech solution brings both signi�cant cost savings as well as 
many other advantages to all stakeholders, and ultimately, 
how you as a DRG subscriber would bene�t from value drivers 
within the Dragon Inc. eco-system. 

We look forward to having you join us on our exciting journey.  
  
                                     Dragon Management Team
      

If you are reading this White Paper, perhaps it can assumed 
that you have an interest in Dragon Inc. and the sale of its 
Dragon Coins (DRG). 

Thank you.

Dragon Inc. has initiated the launch of an exciting and 
highly prospective business that is poised to become a 
powerful force for change within its target sector.  Our 
focus is to dramatically disrupt the legitimate public 
gaming sector, namely casinos. 

We are proud to be joining the ranks of �ntech companies 
who are bringing innovative technological solutions to 
tackle existing problems or ine�ciencies within �nancial 
systems. However, unlike many, we are not seeking funding 
for purely technological development.  

We do, though, very much pride ourselves on being able to  
o�er our native tokens to the market with con�dence, 
knowing that  the Dragon Platform will almost immediately 
serve the needs of a fully operational and substantial 
business. 

Chakrit Ahmad, CEO Dragon Inc.

 It’s a very proud moment. The company and its hardworking, dedicated cadre of staff and contractors live in 
many countries and span numerous time zones, which has made this a truly international and wise counsel. 
Lastly, and most importantly, I would like to thank in advance those who decide to take the opportunity to 
purchase Dragon Coins and by so doing, help to launch what is a highly prospective business, and one that I 
and the entire Dragon team are determined to make a beacon of success.”

The Current Problem

Hundreds of high-roller ‘Elite Gamers’ travel to Macau every 
week of the year to play baccarat and other games of chance 
in “junkets” - VIP high-stakes gaming rooms with a minimum 
stake of millions of dollars - which are operated as separate 
cost centers by shareholding syndicates inside the resort’s 
top tier casinos. 

Many millions of dollars �ow across the tables in these VIP 
gaming rooms daily and junket organizers su�er exorbitant 
fees in arranging for such high volumes of stake monies to 
be ready for use by a VIP gamer upon arrival. Then, having 
enjoyed the gaming and the junket’s hospitality, their 
high-roller VIP guests incur similarly high fees in the repatria-
tion of their winnings.

A junket often needs to arrange stake money of several 
million dollars to be on hand when each elite gamer arrives 
in Macau. The current cost to a junket in making the neces-
sary �nancial arrangements is a minimum of 5%. As for the 
players, they are typically forced to su�er fees of between 
5%-7% for costs related to repatriation of their winnings. 

A major junket in Macau might be hosting more than 100 
elite gamers at any one time, often producing a rolling 
turnover in excess of US$250 million a day. With this level of 
play at the tables and the constant churn of players, the 
frictional costs su�ered by both junkets and their discerning 
elite gamer guests related to the positioning of stake money 
and repatriation of winnings are both huge and punitive.

The Solution

The advent of �ntech solutions whereby �at money can be 
e�ortlessly converted into digital tokens and then moved 
instantly within an eco-system whilst being securely tracked, 
and all at very low cost, o�ers Macau’s junkets a highly attrac-
tive technological solution that will dramatically reduce their 
high inbound frictional costs.      

Indeed digitally tokenizing both stake monies and gaming 
chips and using a blockchain to record transactions and 
track tokens, not only presents junkets but also the casinos 
in Macau and internationally, with an opportunity for step 
change cost reductions, improved e�ciency and higher 
levels of security in the management of inherent high 
volume money �ows.

Through connectivity with our digital value platform, 
namely the Dragon Platform, elite gamers wishing to visit a 
junket could easily convert �at money into digital tokens, 
that would be securely registered on a blockchain underpin-
ning the platform. A numerical representation of the tokens 
held at any one time would be shown in the gamer’s smart 
phone wallet. 

Whenever necessary, the gamer could e�ortlessly convert 
his Dragon Coins (DRG) to �xed-value digital Dragon Global 
Chips (DGC) for use in the junket. After gaming, DGC could 
be converted back into DRG and further converted to �at 
money or any other digital currency when needed, all on 
demand and via the touch screen on a smartphone. If  
gamers choose to keep stake monies and winnings in digital 
form ready for the next visit to the gaming tables, they could 
do so, securely and at minimal cost. 

Application of digital token technology beyond stake 
monies and winnings to the management and tracking of 
individual gaming chips, delivers junkets and casinos with 
signi�cant �nancial gains and bene�ts from improved 
e�ciency and security across their entire ‘cash management’ 
system.

Cost Savings

Use of the Dragon Digital Financial Platform by participating 
junkets and their elite gamers will incur costs much closer to 
1% than the usual 5%. This is a signi�cant saving that 
improves junket pro�tability and releases more stake money 
to gamers.

Wider Benefits

In fact the application of �ntech to the gaming industry has 
wider bene�ts. Crypto and digital currencies are often 
associated with the anonymity of ‘value ownership’, a 
problem casinos also face. However, if the digital �nancial 
platform is managed and operated with sound corporate 
governance and appropriate KYC/AML procedures, then the 
use of digital value tokens within an industry such as 
casinos, where use of money in cash form is highly preva-
lent, can greatly assist in the global drive to eradicate money 
laundering and squeeze the black market economy.

ENTER THE DRAGON 

Applying �ntech to the global casino 
sector will produce cost savings, 
improved e�ciency, and much more

Dragon Inc. is fully committed and focused on applying a 
Fintech solution with robust corporate governance to 
Macau’s junkets and their elite Gamers.

In time, the business is expected to extend to supporting 
casinos both in Macau and internationally.

Carry out any review of the media output on Macau and its 
gaming industry today and you will discover a very positive 
landscape. The reports not only highlight a clear trend of 
strong well-fuelled growth in traditional sectors, especially 
in VIP junkets but, in addition, one will clearly sense a gener-
al air of optimism and dynamic energy that is moving, 
broadening and internationalizing the peninsula’s gaming 
industry. Gaming in Macau is moving strongly ahead.

The industry is well governed by the Gaming Inspection 
and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) which licenses all gaming 
operators, monitors market throughputs and issues 
forecasts. In a recent report, DICJ announced that gaming 
win (gross gaming revenue) in July 2017 was up 29% over 
2016, and stood at US$2.86 billion. Revenue over the �rst 
seven months of 2017 was US$18.5 billion, up 19% on 2016.

These statistics position Macau, which is already the world’s 
largest gaming eco-system, on track to surpass US$30 
billion in a gaming win over 2017. This compares to all 
Nevada casinos, which reported a collective gaming win of 
US$11 billion for 2016.

Industry insiders are bullish on both accelerated growth 
and sustainability. Importantly for Dragon Inc., sector 
analysts generally agree that increases in VIP gamers 
(junkets) numbers is driving the growth. 

Macau’s six licensed casino operators are also eyeing 
international expansion into Japan and Vietnam. These two 
highly prospective regional markets o�er Macau very 
attractive opportunities for growth and cross-territory 
synergies. According to Forbes (Oct 2017), the Japanese 
government intends to complete the legislative process by 
the �rst quarter of 2018 that would let casinos operate in 
the country for the �rst time. 

Aug Sep Oct

Macau boasts 33 �ve-star hotels o�ering 22,000 rooms 
(60.4% of the total), which is an increase of 7.3% on 2016  
Guests coming from Mainland China (688,000), the Repub-
lic of Korea (41,000) and Hong Kong (150,000) have grown 
by 17.3%, 102.1% and 2.7% respectively year-on-year.

Having been invited, or having decided, to attend a VIP 
junket in Macau, a high-roller gamer will inform the junket 
operators of the volume of stake money that he wishes to 
have available (as a credit) at the gaming tables. This can be 
many millions of Hong Kong dollars. The readying of this 
stake money is achieved by the gamer’s junket agent vouch-
ing for his client. 

It is an expensive and traditional system that carries funding 
costs and credit risks, which is why the typical fee, including 
commission for the introducing agent, is 5% of stake 
volume. As an incentive to have the elite gamer attend, and 
to ease the gamer’s cost of entry, this stake arrangement 
cost is picked up by the junket.

On arrival, the elite gamer will be required to register for his 
junket VIP card. This is done by providing a telephone 
number and showing a valid passport. A con�rmation code 
is sent via SMS and a VIP account is opened there and then. 
Having activated his account, the elite gamer then signs a 
deposit form to have the stake monies (which are already 
earmarked for him) credited to his junket account.
 
This money can then be converted into NON-NEGOTIABLE 
gaming chips. These non-negotiable chips cannot be 
cashed. Instead, the gamer must stake them whilst playing 
at the tables. This forces the gamer to ‘roll’ all the money 
across the junket tables, which underpins daily gaming 
volumes. As an incentive to roll, junket operators give the 
elite gamers a 1% rebate on their gross stake monies once 
they complete the �rst roll.

Winnings are given in the form of NEGOTIABLE gaming 
chips, which may be staked or cashed out at the cashier’s 
desk. Having decided to return home with the rewards, the 
player will once again require the assistance of the junket 
managers. This operation will cost the elite gamer between 
5%-7% of his winnings.
    
Maximum stakes at baccarat tables in a Macau VIP junket can 
be as high as HK$2 million per play, and daily rolling volumes 
easily reach HK$2 billion, with a junket possibly hosting over 
100 elite gamers a day.  Most will play baccarat but other 
games of chance are on o�er.  

There are currently more than 190 licensed junkets in Macau 
with the top 40 accounting for 80% of total VIP revenue.

International networks of agents vet the credit worthiness 
and suitability of high-roller gamers before introducing them 
to the VIP junket’s operators. Agents receive commission 
from the junket operators for giving credit to the elite gamer 
and they are responsible to the junket for any debt collection.  

The top 40 VIP junkets account for 80% of the total VIP stake 
�ows, which, according to Bloomberg, for Suncity Group, one 
of the major  VIP room operators, recently surpassed a 
monthly volume of HK$130 billion (US$17 billion).

Other major VIP junket operators include Neptune Group Ltd, 
Dore Holdings Ltd, and Lao Kun Group Holding Company 
Limited (formerly known as Asia Entertainment & Resources 
Limited). All are fully licensed by the Macau Gaming Inspec-
tion and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) and several top tier 
junket operators have group companies listed on the Hong 
Kong Stock Exchange. All junket operators must have the 
support of one of the Territory’s licensed gaming concession-
aires and sub-concessionaires (major casinos).

Andrew Lo, executive director of Suncity Group Holdings Ltd 
recently forecast an upturn of 30% in business this year over 

2016, adding his view, “The growth will continue”.    
 (Bloomberg, 31 August 2017)

A ‘Junket’ is an area or a room in a casino leased by operators who invest and manage 
these venues as independent profit centers. So-called ‘Elite Gamers’ are then invited to 
attend and are fully hosted whilst they play high-stakes games of chance. In Macau such 
junkets are extremely popular and the game of choice is high-stakes baccarat. 

A Macau junket can often host well over 100 elite gamers each day and operates 24/7.

Dragon Inc. will build and steadily grow a community 
centered on a digital tokenized value-management eco-sys-
tem tailored to meet the needs of casinos and their gaming 
guests. The initial focus will be on the niche junket sector of 
Macau and some other South East Asia countries, where both 
frictional �nancial costs and daily cash �ows are very high. 
Targeting the junket sector will very quickly provide the 
platform with both committed users and signi�cant daily 
transactional cross-platform �ows.

Contracted Junkets

We have already signed contracts with four di�erent junket 
operators in Macau. Over time, the Dragon brand will grow 
through entering into partnerships with many, if not all, of 
Macau’s leading junkets. These junkets, some of which are 
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will greatly bene�t 
from being connected to the Dragon �nancial eco-system.          

Not only will these partner junkets immediately improve their              
pro�tability and e�ciency, but they will also bene�t from 
access to the Dragon Community of gamers, many of whom 
will be very high net worth individuals who are committed 
and regular gamers.

The Dragon Junket and DGC Acceptance  

Dragon Inc. targets being operational as a licensed junket in 
Macau - branded as the �rst ‘Dragon Junket’ – before the 
upcoming Chinese New Year 2018. Four key junket parters will 
join as Dragon a�liated junkets by end of Q1 2018.

The Dragon Junket has direct access to tens of thousands of 
elite gamers globally who will ensure attendance and demand 
for DRG from Day One. As a sign of con�dence, the operators 
have already committed no less than US$265 million to the 
project, which constitutes 53% of the total supply of Dragon 
Coins.

Only junkets branded under the ‘Dragon’ brand, and those  
junkets a�liated with Dragon Inc., will bene�t from the 
commercial leverage of the Dragon Community. Gamers will 
have to be a member of the Dragon Community (and holder 
of DRG/DGC) to attend and play in the Dragon Junket and 
wherever Dragon Global Chips are accepted. 
    
However, the reach of Dragon will extend beyond Macau’s 
junket market. We expect many casinos in Macau to quickly 
recognize the merits of linking into Dragon Community 
membership, many of whom will be very committed gamers,  
they will therefore readily welcome and accept conversion of 
Dragon Global Chips in their establishments.

Membership of the Dragon Community, Dragon Inc. will not be 
exclusively focused on high net worth individuals and 
high-roller elite gamers.

The Dragon Community will embrace gamers at all rungs of 
the expendable income ladder. Indeed, the long-term goal is 
to broaden and strengthen the Dragon Community well 
beyond junkets in Macau, and well beyond Macau itself.

The business model and the bene�ts that the Dragon brand 
will bring to casinos and their solid cadres of committed 
gamers, is globally applicable. In reality, Macau and its junkets 
will serve as an unusually solid and highly pro�table ‘proof of 
concept’ that can be used to underpin  the global roll out of the 
Dragon brand and growth of the Dragon Community.

Debit Cards and ATMs
   
To support members bridging across from the Dragon 
Platform to the legacy banking system and �at money, Dragon 
Inc. will issue each member with a Dragon debit card on the 
global MasterCard/Visa network. This will allow members to 
draw cash and also settle charges for purchases and services 
directly from their Dragon account. 

We will also roll out our own network of digital token compati-
ble ATMs. This will start in mid-2018 with these ‘Global Cash 
Machines’ appearing in Dragon Junkets and all a�liated 
junkets and casinos.

Dragon Inc. will seek to draw together interested actors in the 
sector to harmonize cross-industry e�orts and standardize 
protocols. 

Dragon-branded Hotel/Casinos 

Within approximately three years, with the Dragon brand 
well-established in Macau and spreading through the interna-
tional casino sector, Dragon Inc. has plans to open the �rst of a 
number of Dragon-branded hotels and casinos. The ‘disruptive’ 
plan is to own and operate a �agship hotel/casino in Macau 
that is �oating, static anchored, eco-friendly and cashless 
(accepting DRG only). 

Such a unique and world-class, luxury leisure destination 
would almost certainly become a highly popular international 
gaming tourist attraction and further boost the international 
image and hospitality extended by Macau to the world. 

The working name for the �rst proof of concept cashless 
hotel/casino is ‘Dragon Pearl’ and it could be operational in 
early H1 2020.

BUILDING THE BASE

We will quickly build an international  
community of DRG holders who all 
help to power the Dragon eco-system

We believe that the prospects for the develop-
ment of a strong base upon which to build a 
global Dragon Community are very promising.

6



Dragon Inc., established in 2017 and registered in the British 
Virgin Islands, will develop the Dragon Platform and 
promote its real-world application. The company will also 
promote platform governance and transparency.

The Dragon Platform will grow steadily within an interna-
tional ecosystem and the Dragon Community of platform 
users, gaming establishments, gamers and DRG holders all 
linked by smartphone app wallets.

Ethereum Blockchain / ERC20 Compliance

The Dragon Platform will be securely underpinned by the 
internationally acclaimed ethereum blockchain that will act 
as the immutable distributed ledger backbone upon which 
Dragon will host its complete digital ‘cash/token/chip’ 
management solution. 

   

 In addition, to the extent that any excess funds are generated 
by the Dragon Platform from transactions and other fees, a 
RNG algorithmic process will be initiated by the Dragon 
Platform to expend such excess funds to acquire DRG which 
may be trading on secondary markets. Such DRG tokens 
acquired through the burns will be destroyed.

Membership gives the DRG holder the right to access the 
Dragon Platform with certain privileges and other bene�ts or 
even to operate casino tables or other services within the  
Dragon Community.  

Dragon Global Chips - DGC

In addition to DRG, the Dragon Platform will securely support 
a family of digital utility tokens called Dragon Global Chips: 
‘DGC’. These DGC tokens can be purchased by converting DRG 
at the prevailing market rate.

The �rst global chip will be the DGC-HK, with its value pegged 
to the Hong Kong dollar, at a rate of 1 DGC-HK = HK$1.00. 
Subsequent DGC tokens in the family will carry a value that is 
permanently pegged to a speci�c �at currency. The need for 
DGC arises because of the �uctuating nature of all value 
tokens. DRG value can rise or fall signi�cantly over a short 
period of time. The purpose of DGC is to allow users to lock a 
certain number of chips at an exchange rate between DRG 
and DGC that they are comfortable with.

DRG/DGC Internal Convertibility 

Members can only acquire DGC by conversion of DRG. Gamers 
will therefore need to own DRG in order to buy DGC, which 
can only be exchanged for non-negotiable physical gaming 
chips at the Dragon Junket or any Dragon a�liated gaming 
venue. 

Dragon gamers have the option of either receiving cash or 
digital currencies when cashing in physical negotiable 
gaming chips. These operations will be undertaken using 
secure ‘gamer-cashier’ wallet to wallet transfers over mobile 
data/Wi-Fi, or using secure NFC (near �eld communication 
technology). If the gamer chooses to receive cash, he will 
receive physical �at money and will be responsible for the 
methods and expenses of bringing home that money. If he 
chooses to receive digital currency, the cashier will perform 
the neccessary transactions and transfer the desired digital 
currency to the gamer’s wallet, net of fees (0.5%).

Given the anticipated high volume and vast numbers of daily 
transactions in DGC, it may not be appropriate to have these 
tokens on the ethereum blockchain. 

CONTROLLING THE DRAGON

Our ethereum/ERC20 based platform will 
host the native DRG; the eco-system will 
include DGC, a gaming transactional token  
system

DRG tokens act as the Dragon Community’s internal 
digital currency, freely convertible to �at money or other 
major crypto coins, DGC act as the community’s digital 
utility tokens, each with a �xed value, like virtual gaming 
chips, and freely convertible to and from DRG and also 
non-negotiable physical gaming chips in the Dragon 
Junket or any Dragon a�liated gaming venue. 

Dragon Coins - DRG

At the digital heart of Dragon’s ethereum-based platform is 
Dragon Coins, designated and registered with the token 
market abbreviation: ‘DRG’. The Dragon Coin (DRG) is a 
native ethereum divisible digital token with up to 8 decimal 
places. The total number of DRG to be issued is 500 million, 
which will be minted, managed and governed by the 
industry’s leading ERC20 compliant smart contract 
technology and associated protocols, all operated over the           
ethereum blockchain.

Use of DRG

Owning DRG automatically entitles a person to membership 
of Dragon and so grants access to the Dragon Platform. 
Members will be entitled to certain privileges, including but 
not limited to, access to Dragon Junkets and a�liated 
junkets and casinos that have adopted DRG. DRG holders, as 
Dragon Platform members, are not entitled to any �nancial 
rights of the Dragon Inc. at any time and memberships do 
not entitle DRG holders to any distribution of pro�ts nor any 
claim on any assets. Memberships are not provided with any 
right of redemption.

7



Buying, Selling and Converting DRG

After completion of the Token Sale, DRG can be purchased 
with �at money or BTC, ETH, XRP, LTH, through a number of 
leading industry-recognized partner crypto-exchanges or 
directly through the in-house Dragon Exchange.

Social Wallet

Members of the Dragon Community, de�ned as being fully 
AML/KYC cleared individuals and duly registered with 
Dragon as account holders, will be entitled to use the full 
functionality state-of-the-art smartphone Dragon a�liated 
‘Social Wallet’ which will help them visualize the number of 
DRG, DGC and other forms of digital value tokens stored 
securely in their Dragon account on the ethereum block-
chain. The Dragon Wallet will fully support the holding of 
both DRG and DGC.

DRG and BTC / Alt Coins

The Dragon Platform and Dragon Community Wallet will 
support the holding and cross-conversion of DRG to BTC, 
ETH, XRP, LTC plus other major digital currencies in the 
future.

[Note: The Social Wallet is scheduled is be released in 
December 2017, and prior to that, members will be advised 
to use a secure, ERC20 compatible, crypto-utility wallet]

Dragon Debit Card

Every Dragon member can opt to receive a physical Dragon 
multi-currency debit card linking their Dragon account to 
the global MasterCard/Visa network of ATMs and vendors.

Global Cash Machines

The platform will be connected to a network of Global Cash 
Machines (GCMs), that will allow members to use their 
Dragon debit cards to draw �at cash by converting the 
digital value stored in their account wallets (whether held as 
DRG, BTC, ETH, XRP or LTC). Members will also be able to 
deposit �at money into their wallets at GCMs.

The roll out plan is to �rst position GCMs in every Dragon 
Junket and Dragon a�liated gaming venue. Later, GCMs will 
be sited strategically in major cities in the Far East/ASEAN 
region, and thereafter in a number of major cities globally.

Global Cash Machines Starting in Q1 2018 Dragon Inc. plans 
to position digital token compatible ATMs in all Dragon and 
a�liated gaming venues. These will be branded Global Cash 
Machines (GCMs). In time, the network of GCMs will steadily 
expand so that members of the Dragon Community - along 
with holders of other major crypto coins - will be able gain 
ready access to cash directly from their digital currency 
wallets. Dragon Inc. will seek to draw together interested 
actors in the sector to harmonize e�orts and standardize 
protocols.

Ethereum

Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: 
applications that run exactly as programmed without any 
possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party 
interference.
These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously 
powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value 
around and represent the ownership of property. 
This enables developers to create markets, store registries of 
debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions 
given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and 
many other things that have not been invented yet, all 
without a middle man or counterparty risk.
The project was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 
2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  
Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-pro�t, with contributions 
from great minds across the globe.
On traditional server architectures, every application has to 
set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated 
silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised 
or goes o�ine, many users and other apps are a�ected.
On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates 
the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and 
be compensated by users and app developers. This allows 
user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like

How smart contracts work

It is worth noting that bitcoin was the �rst to support basic 
smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer 
value from one person to another. The network of nodes will 
only validate transactions if certain conditions are met, but 
bitcoin is limited to the currency use case.
By contrast, ethereum replaces bitcoin's more restrictive 
language (a scripting language of a hundred or so scripts) 
and replaces it with a language that allows developers to 
write their own programs.
Ethereum allows developers to program their own smart 
contracts, or 'autonomous agents', as the ethereum white 
paper calls them. The language is 'Turing-complete', meaning 
it supports a broader set of computational instructions. 

Smart contracts are usually written in Solidity, a programming 
language speci�cally developed for this purpose. It is then 
compiled into byte code, which is submitted to the Ethereum 
blockchain. Here it will remain active in readiness to be 
triggered by a speci�ed event. After that, all nodes in the 
Ethereum network will execute it.

The Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) will execute the code 
and record all approved transactions, and by way of the 
principles of the distributed node structure and functionality, 
will create an immutable ledger containing transactional 
data.

Smart contracts can:
•Function as 'multi-signature' accounts, so that funds are 
spent only when a required percentage of people agree
•Manage agreements between users, say, if one buys 
insurance from the other
•Provide utility to other contracts (similar to how a software 
library works)
•Store information about an application, such as domain 
registration information or membership records.

Before Chinese New Year 2018, Dragon Inc. will have its �rst 
branded Dragon Junket fully operational and utilizing 
Dragon Global Chips as its only form of internal gaming 
currency. This exclusive branded gaming venue will be 
operated in partnership with the operators of the largest 
and most successful junkets in Macau. Dragon Inc. and the 
junket operators are already contracted to run the junket 
and US$ 265 million has been secured (for DRG tokens 
through this Token Sale) which will be the necessary depos-
it to cover stake monies.

Average daily gaming �ows for 2018 are forecasted to be 
over US$ 300 million from players who are already linked to 
the existing junkets operated by Dragon’s new partners. 
The main game of chance at the tables will continue to be 
baccarat.

The Dragon Junket will operate on similar principles to 
existing junkets, but with some important modi�cations to 
the standard internal gaming protocols. These rule changes 
will help stimulate a broadening of membership of the 
Dragon Community. 

Unlike the existing junket system, gamers wishing to attend 
the Dragon Junket will not need to register at the venue. 
Instead, at their leisure, they can become members of the 
Dragon Community by applying online, passing through 
the registration and KYC/AML procedure and installing a 
Dragon Community Wallet on their smart phone. This may 
be done at the venue but most members will have done 
this well ahead of arriving at the Dragon Junket.

The majority of gamers will arrive with DRG or DGC tokens 
in their account and showing on their smart phone wallets.

Once inside the Dragon Junket, members can use smart 
phone NFC protocol (or wallet-to-wallet transfer) at the 
Dragon customer service desk to sell DRG and buy the 
house digital chips, DGC-HK (Dragon Global Chips). These 
have a �xed rate value of 1 DGC = HK$ 1.00. These DCG-HK 
will then also appear in their wallet. 

Having charged their account with DGC, the gamer can 
then choose when to convert DGC to physical gaming chips 
for play at the baccarat tables. 

Note: Playing with physical chips is still considered a key 
feature of the collective enjoyment, excitement and practi-
cal convenience of real-time gaming in casinos. 

As with the existing junket system, the physical gaming chips 
issued by the cashier’s desk in the Dragon Junket will be 
non-negotiable. This means the gamer has to stake all his 
non-negotiable chips at the tables. Winnings, however, are 
given in negotiable chips, which may be staked or cashed in at 
the cashier’s desk for DGC.

In addition, all gamers at the Dragon Junket will receive an 
incentive rebate of 1% once they have ‘rolled’ (staked ) all their 
non-negotiable chips.

A major di�erence between the Dragon Junket and tradition-
al junkets is that Dragon gamers will not face blanket high 
levels of minimum stakes. Gaming will be possible at more 
modest levels of minimum stake.

If the gamer requires more stake money during a gaming 
session, or perhaps overnight in readiness for the next day’s 
play, �at funds in the gamer’s bank account can be used to 
buy DRG through the Dragon in-house exchange, or other 
exchanges,  for conversion to DGC. These DGC can immedi-
ately be used to acquire more physical gaming chips. Alterna-
tively, if the member holds su�cient DRG already, then it is 
simply a matter of buying DGC with DRG, and getting physical 
chips for DGC from the cashier in order to continue to play. 
This is very di�erent from the cumbersome procedure at 
traditional junkets, where it is virtually impossible for a gamer, 
VIP or otherwise, to bring in additional stake money without 
incurring very punitive loan or positioning costs, with the 
whole process taking many hours or even days. 

Having played the tables, the gamers at the Dragon Junket 
will visit the cashier to convert their physical gaming chips to 
any digital currency. When done, they are free to leave the 
venue with their holding of digital currency securely held in 
their smart phone wallet.

The ease, speed and security of the procedure for gamers 
within the Dragon Junket (and all a�liated junkets and 
casinos too) will be a major driver in building regular gamer 
numbers.  In addition, the Dragon Junket will break down 
some of the ‘elitist’ barriers to gaming and broaden the base, 
whilst retaining that all-important exclusivity label. 

The biggest bene�t to gamers, and the strongest growth 
driver, will be the dramatic reduction in costs and fees 
compared to the present junket system. Costs to gamers for 
the return of winnings will drop from the current level of 
between 5%-7%, to around 1%. A very signi�cant saving, 
which is likely to boost business still further by releasing 
additional funds for gamers that they can stake at the tables 
in the Dragon Junket.      

LET THE PLAY BEGIN

By having our own licensed junket, we 
will secure immediate transaction �ow 
for the platform, driving DRG demand

Audit 

If the Dragon Coin Sale is supported to the level predicted 
by many, it is destined to become one of the largest token 
generation events in the history. Whilst being an accolade, 
this places a higher than usual burden of responsibility on 
the Dragon team and their advisors. 

Given this, and Dragon’s overriding principle of security and 
full transparency for DRG holders, each ERC20 compliant 
Smart Contract linked to the ethereum blockchain will be 
subjected to independent crypto audits prior to the Token 
Sale.

DRG Allocation

The maximum number of DRG that could be created is 
capped at 500 million, which are allocated as follows:

Founders:    10%  (50 million DRG)          
Advisors:      1% (5 million DRG)
Treasury:                         7% (35 million DRG)
Reserve:    10% (50 million DRG)

Token Sale:   
(i) Junket Partners   53% (265 million DRG)
(ii) Early Supporters 12% (60 million DRG)
(iii) Public Sale     7% (35 million DRG)

DRG held in Treasury will be used for but not limited to:
Bonus DRG to Core Subscribers, and
Bonus DRG to the Dragon Social Fund

Note: The numbers of DRG for both of the above donations 
are dependent on take up of Core Subscriber packages (see 
p. 12 for details).

DRG held in Reserve may be sold in subsequent rounds of 
token generation events or in the market, upon reaching 
the next milestone.  

 THE DRAGON BREATHES

360 million DRG will be sold through 
the Dragon Coin Sale, out of which 
73.6% has been committed!

1. Bonus Packages are restricted - one package (either 
Bronze, Silver or Gold) per individual subscriber
2. Bonus DRG will be credited to Core Subscriber’s wallets 
within 45 days from close of the Token Sale.

Junket Partners

The main initial driver of Dragon business is the Dragon 
Junket, scheduled to be operational before the upcoming 
Chinese New Year. DRG holders will bene�t from growth in 
immediate gaming volumes at the Dragon Junket. 

To operate e�ciently, Dragon Inc. will be required to lodge a 
substantial gaming deposit with the host casino so as to 
provide cover for daily gaming in the Dragon Junket. 

The Dragon Junket will be able to leverage some 2.5 times 
on whatever deposit is put in place. This leveraged deposit 
sum sets the ceiling for gaming volumes. The higher the 
‘covered’ gaming limit, the more gamers can stake with 
resulting bene�ts.

Typically, junkets receive an annualized net contribution of 
some 35% of the average daily gaming deposit (i.e. 35% 
after funding all routine operational costs).

265 million DRG are allocated in the Token Sale for strategic 
partners of the Dragon Junket. This allocation will serve to 
bind the partners’ commitment to the Dragon Community. 

Note: Dragon Inc. has already FULLY pre-sold this element of 
the Crowd Sale.

Presale - Early Supporters

Since the project’s inception and early stage development, 
Dragon Inc. has received heartening support from within 
both the crypto and the wider communities. Many so-called 
‘Early Supporters’ have expressed solid interest in support-
ing the business and have pledged �nancial support.

60 million DRG will be placed at US$ 1.00 per DRG with 
Dragon’s Early Supporters. The presale to Early Supporters 
have started since early November and will continue until 
3rd December 2017.

Public Sale

The public subscription component of the Token Sale will 
run no more than one (1) week from 8th December 2017 to 
31th December 2017 - a total of 35 million DRG will be 
o�ered at 0.00333ETH per DRG - and through it, Dragon 
aims to gain a wide base of DRG holders.

Dragon Inc., established in 2017 and registered in the British 
Virgin Islands, will develop the Dragon Platform and 
promote its real-world application. The company will also 
promote platform governance and transparency.

The Dragon Platform will grow steadily within an interna-
tional ecosystem and the Dragon Community of platform 
users, gaming establishments, gamers and DRG holders all 
linked by smartphone app wallets.

Ethereum Blockchain / ERC20 Compliance

The Dragon Platform will be securely underpinned by the 
internationally acclaimed ethereum blockchain that will act 
as the immutable distributed ledger backbone upon which 
Dragon will host its complete digital ‘cash/token/chip’ 
management solution. 

   

Based on assumptions that the Token Sale of 360 mllion DRG is fully sold out and the subsequent token sale or 
saledown out of the Reserve of 50 million DRG is also completed at a price of no less than US$1 per DRG, Dragon Inc. 
anticipates receiving approximately US$420 million in proceeds from the sale of a total of 410 million DRG. The amount 
expected to be received is enough for Dragon Inc. to start its main operation and purpose of servicing high rollers 
immediately. It is our intention to show our supporters and the community that the business is indeed lucrative. 

The company’s full roll out plan includes the following investments and expenses:

  
 Development / Operations  
 Dragon Social Wallet and Exchange = US$ 2 million (3 years for development and maintenance)
 Reserve for Global Cash Machines = US$ 14 million (US$ 28,000 for each GCM a total of 500 GCMs)
 500 Global Cash Machines  = US$ 14 million   (3 years for development and maintenance)
 Marketing/Promotion (Year 1) = US$ 10 million (Major spend to quickly ramp up member numbers)
 Deposit for the Dragon Junket = US$ 350 million

 Working Capital    = US$ 15 million

 Dragon Pearl Project  = US$ 15 million (Pre-Engineering design) 

                      

FUNDING THE BUSINESS

Prudent use of Token Sale proceeds is key 
for sound development of the business, 
safeguarding the future for stakeholders

14



Social Fund

Working Capital

            

Funds reserved as working capital will be initially kept in a professionally managed porfolio of cash, DRG and 
other major cryptocurrencies, and will be prudently used to support Dragon’s long-term business goals. Below 
are some possible strategic uses for the funds.

(a) Deposits

Building a strong eco-system of branded and a�liated junkets will require us to share with our future partners 
the burden of lodging deposits to cover gaming stake volumes. 

Such �nancial support directly bene�ts the Dragon Community and DRG holders

(b) General Business Development 

Monies from the Dragon Reserve Fund will be accessible to support general business development and 
unplanned opportunities to build growth.

(c) Dragon Pearl

The Dragon Pearl project (for details, please refer to section headed “The Dragon Pearl”) will attract many new 
participants into the Dragon Community and will promote our brand internationally.  

Part of the working capital might well be loaned to the project to cover any unexpected shortfall or change in 
long-term funding structures, and also to fund the on-going expenses for set-up and early stage operations.

GUARDING THE GOLD 

Ring fencing  funding in separate cells, 
each with its own governance and usage 
rules aids prudent and sound �nancial 
control             

Dragon Inc. believes strongly that responsible companies should consider the social impact of their business and 
also ensure that they invest back into the communities that help drive their business. Our Social Fund will spear-
head our social responsibility programme.

In the spirit of ‘8’ being a lucky number in Chinese philosophy,  the founders of Dragon Inc. have directed the 
Charity Fund to focus on eight core issues.

1. Support to NGOs tackling e�ects of gambling addiction
2. Wider education of young people in blockchain and digital currency related technology
3. Poverty alleviation in the communities in Dragon has gaming operations
4. Illiteracy  in the communities in Dragon has gaming operations
5. Job creation programmes in the communities which Dragon has gaming operations
6. General support for the elderly in Macau
7. ASEAN and Far East cultural and educational exchange programmes
8. Scholarships for degrees in computer technology

The Dragon Coin Sale therefore includes the following restrictive conditions:

DRG older category   Restriction 

Founders     Maximum 10% of holding may be sold during Year 1
     No restriction thereafter

Advisors     Resale restriction for no more than 1 Year

Junket Partners    Maximum 50% re-sale permitted during Year 1
     No restriction thereafter

Early Supporter    No re-sale permitted for 3 months
     No restriction thereafter

Public Subscribers    No restriction

The founders and management of Dragon Inc. are acutely aware of typical market 
dynamics and token holder sensitivity in the weeks and months following any public 
token o�ering. There are numerous examples of o�erings where holders of newly 
acquired tokens have su�ered fall back in market pricing following a token sale for a 
variety of reasons. One factor is holders of heavily discounted tokens choosing to 
take quick pro�ts. 

Whilst the market’s attitude and reaction to the launch of DRG is beyond the control 
of Dragon Inc. and its management, sensible measures have been included in the 
Token Sale structure to help shield token holders from early price slippage. Indeed, 
it is hoped that these mechanisms, combined with the early commencement of 
business through the Dragon Junket, will go a long way towards bolstering market 
sentiment and supporting pressure for upward price movement.

Dragon Inc.’s management is fully committed to delivering value, especially over the 
long term, to all members of the Dragon Community through solid and strategic 
development of the underlying business. 

As a sign of that commitment, a practical mechanism has been put in place by way 
of sale restrictions for DRG holders who acquire DRG outside the public sale. 

ENTER THE DRAGON 

We will quickly build an international  
community of DRG holders who will all 
help to power the Dragon eco-system

16



As with any community, members participate for a number 
of reasons and for a range of bene�ts (‘value’), both 
tangible and intangible.

Members of the Dragon Community will no doubt each 
view their membership and participation as being bene�-
cial to them in ways that are very personal. Some might see 
bene�t in holding DRG with no obvious intention of visiting 
a Dragon gaming venue in the short or medium term. 
Others might value the opportunity to use Dragon as a safe 
way to enter the modern world of digital currencies and 
have a wallet on their smart phone linked to a widely 
accepted Dragon debit card. Some might place greater 
value on that sense of pioneering spirit that led them to 
early association with a promising start-up. Whilst others, 
who might be a signi�cant slice of the membership, might 
view becoming a member and holding DRG as a valuable 
means to an end - namely convenient and low-cost gaming.

Dragon Inc. is fully mindful of this broad spectrum of 
di�ering value drivers for members of the Dragon Commu-
nity. Therefore the business model and the Token Sale 
within that, contain a range of mechanisms that in a variety 
of ways, directly or indirectly, reward members for their 
loyalty and participation.

The token economy and business plan contains value 
drivers for DRG holders and the wider Dragon Community 
that support strong demand pressure to acquire and hold 
DRG.

Availability of  DRG

The Token Sale contains a lock up for some categories of 
DRG holders. This will impact the supply side of DRG until 
all lock ups have been served.

Burning DRG

Commencing three months after the beginning of operations, 
the company will begin a DRG burn programme.

The burn will be funded using part of the net monthly 
income of the month two months prior from the Dragon 
Junket and the a�liate junkets.   

 

“One Month, One Millionaire” Air Drop

As an incentive to holding DRG, 10% of the net monthly 
income from all Dragon Junkets and a�liated junkets will be 
air-dropped into the wallet of one very fortunate DRG holder 
through algorithmic random selection.  Not only will Dragon 
be rewarding DRG holders, but it will also essentially be 
creating a new high roller every month. Dragon Inc. will use 
the pro�t to buy DRG in exchanges and air drop reward as 
DRG 

This will happen based on coin ownership on the 8th day of 
each month at 8.00 pm Macau local time. 

The Air Drop will start three months after the commencement 
of operations. 

Expansion of Dragon Gaming Venues

Dragon Inc. is committed to the Dragon Junket and four 
A�liate junket being operational in Q1 2018. Based on the 
current plan, a second Dragon Junket and at least four more 
A�liate junkets will be operational in Macau by end 2018. 

Dragon Global Chips 

The intention over time is to steadily expand the user base of  
DGC across the entire international casino industry, which will 
require many more gamers to buy DRG.

Global Cash Machines

The roll out of ‘crypto-friendly’ Global Cash Machines that 
support the cashing out of DRG will bene�t DRG holders and 
assist in making DRG a digital currency of choice beyond the 
sphere of the gaming community.

Cashless Hotel/Casinos

The much anticipated �agship Dragon Pearl hotel/casino in 
Macau will be the �rst in a planned chain of cashless environ-
ments where gamers and guests will require DRG to pay for 
DGC, chips, accommodation, goods and services.

Digital Currency Status

Although DRG is being born out of a need in the elite gaming 
sector, holding DRG does not compel holders to ever enter a 
Dragon gaming venue. The trust that will be developed by the 
market in the Dragon Coin gives scope for DRG to become a 
widely accepted and trusted major digital currency. 

Built into the plan are a number of 
engines that will help drive demand 
value and positive market sentiment

17



The Dragon Pearl hotel/casino is set to be a transformative 
hospitality concept boasting 400 luxury guest rooms and 
suites, restaurants and retail spaces, a pool, spa and sports 
facilities, as well as ample car parking. 

Of special interest to the Dragon Community will be the 
16,000 square meters of dedicated �oor space for gaming. 

Applying state-of-the-art marine and o�shore engineering 
techniques, all this will be designed into a 100m diameter 
�oating construction, anchored close to shore with a vehicle 
and pedestrian causeway. The �rst preferred location is 
Macau.

It is also planned to make the Dragon Pearl a cashless hospi-
tality complex, where everything is paid for using digital 
tokens. DRG and DGC will be the only permitted in-house 
transaction digital currencies. 

The hotel will be designed to the highest safety standards 
and levels of environmental e�ciency. It will be one of the 
most eco-friendly habitable �oating eco-systems in the 
world. 

The facility will be energy-neutral (worst case) and self-sus-
taining in terms of heat and power. It will also have its own 
desalination and waste-recycling plants.    

Dragon Inc. entered into contractual mode in August 2017 
and has held discussions concerning outline speci�cation 
and design. The focus is now on gaining provisional 
clearance  from the authorities in Macau before cementing 
the investment and moving to the next stage.

Assuming the necessary approvals and construction go as 
planned, the expected opening is early-mid 2021.

One of the main social bene�ts of the Dragon eco-system is the contribution to improved governance within the casino 
sector. Every person in the Dragon Community (holders of the DRG digital currency) will have passed through KYC/AML 
screening conducted by a highly reputable and specialist due diligence company (Identity Mind Global) at arm’s length to 
Dragon Inc.. The whole community of gamers will therefore be legitimized in terms of identi�cation, something the 
traditional system lacked. The ecosystem will therefore have within it the immutable record of all transactions conducted 
by all wallets belonging to members of the Dragon Community. Dragon Inc. fully respects the privacy of its members so  
the identity of the wallet holders will not be publicly available, however, the Dragon Inc. will fully comply with any legal 
request from relevant authorities regarding identi�cation of a wallet holder, should the need arise.

Our business plan is in line with governments’ general trend towards a cashless society where all value is clearly identi�-
able and fully recorded. 

In addition to identity and �scal governance, Dragon Inc. is extremely serious in its desire to operate to a high standard 
regarding social responsibilities and have established the Dragon Social Fund with clear directives to target through 
multiple funding channels, NGOs, as well as social and educational development agencies that are actively and successful-
ly engaged in building capacity within casino related industry and certain carefully identi�ed sectors of society and 
communities where Dragon Inc. is operative.

Dragon Inc. is committed to a coherent management system aimed at maximizing the interests of all its stakeholders.
