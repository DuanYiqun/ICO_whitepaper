1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The NAGA Development Association Ltd. (“NDAL”) has partnered with The NAGA Group AG (“NAGA 

AG”) to introduce the NAGA COIN (“NGC”), a token that will serve as the unit of account in all existing 

and future projects of the NAGA Group AG. 

The NAGA Group AG is a German holding of technology companies which was founded in 2015 and 

is listed on the German Stock Exchange (the group companies of the NAGA Group AG hereinafter 

collectively referred to as “NAGA”). Over the last 2 years, NAGA has raised over $15m in capital 

from various prestigious investors, such as one of Europe’s oldest banks Hauck & Aufhaeuser 

(founded 1796) and from China’s largest private investment conglomerate FOSUN. NAGA also per-

formed the fastest German IPO within the last 15 years.1  

The company employs more than 120 people and operates in the capital markets and gaming 

domain. On the 10th of July 2017, NAGA AG was listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with an 

issuing price of €2.60 per stock. Just 3 months later, the stock price is trading over 400% above 

the issue price and has become one of the most successful and most traded retail stocks in Ger-

many. 

NAGA specializes in the development of cutting edge technology for capital markets and gaming. 

The company operates and owns an EU-licensed brokerage company, one of the fastest growing 

social networks for trading (NAGA TRADER ) with millions of EUR in realized revenues, and a virtual 

goods exchange (Switex), which is backed by one of the world’s largest exchanges as a Joint Ven-

ture partner. NAGA’s technology expertise ranges from financial markets, robo-advisory and algo-

trading to gaming and blockchain technology. 

Given the fact that the financial service sector is still inaccessible (it still unnecessarily requires 

banks) for over 2 billion people and heavily complex, with non-transparent cost structures, and that 

there is no central solution to these problems, NAGA’s mission is to open up the world of trading 

financial and virtual goods to everyone in one unified platform. NAGA identified three major prob-

lems of the financial service sector: Firstly, it is still inaccessible for over 2 billion people and heavily 

complex. Secondly, there are no one-stop solutions where users can securely and reliably store 

their data and have a complete product offering for trading. Thirdly, cost structures in these sectors 

are non-transparent and disadvantageous to the user. 

NAGA’s mission is to open up the world of trading financial and virtual goods to everyone. 

After building up a team of 120 dedicated and motivated people, spending tens of millions of EUR 

on licenses and technology, as well as establishing a business that has hundreds of thousands of 

clients, millions of EUR in revenues, and billions of EUR in trading volume, NAGA formulated the 

credo “Power to the people”. As a logical next step, NAGA is introducing a decentralized unit of 

account on its platforms – The NAGA Coin (NGC). The NGC will unite all platforms in the NAGA 

ecosystem through its own wallet service called The NAGA Wallet. The NAGA Wallet aims to bridge 

NAGA’s two major projects and enable an ecosystem for the social trading of cryptocurrencies,

virtual goods and stocks. The concept of enabling gamers to turn their passion into a wealth gen-

erating hobby has been a dream come true for many millennials, and Naga’s goal is to make this a 

reality. 

Hence, the digital NAGA ecosystem powered by the NGC will give everyone the ability to convert any 

currency to crypto-currencies, along with access to stocks or virtual in-game goods across various 

platforms. It will allow everyone to trade at a transparent cost structure, and receive cashback and 

bonuses through a sophisticated token economy framework. Ultimately the NAGA Wallet will serve 

as a one-stop shop solution that ensures that users’ currency is stored on a secure and reliable 

platform. The NAGA team strongly believes that the merging of an innovative, established and fast-

growing technology company driven by the community with the blockchain, will ensure the steady 

value increase of the NGC in the near future. 

Against all concerns that were raised before the fastest IPO of the past 15 years in Germany, NAGA 

won over the entire German Stock market and generated a 400% return on its share price for all 

early contributors. It was in its first week after the IPO, Germany’s most traded retail stock – more 

than Apple or Tesla.  

Given NAGA’s partner’s NDAL mission statement to democratize the world of trading and the big 

momentum around blockchain, NAGA creates, with the NAGA Coin, another opportunity to be an 

early contributor and benefit from the token and platform growth. 

As a publicly listed company, NAGA AG combines many key advantages for token holders. The most 

important key advantages are listed below: 

• A listed German entity with millions of EUR in yearly revenues, billions of EUR in trading 
volume, and several hundred thousand transactions per month.2 

• The NAGA AG stock has attracted massive press attention and was even considered one of 
the top traded retail shares in Germany. 

• The roadmap is unlike others “already written” – NAGA has the users, the technology, and 
millions in revenues and billions in trading revenue! The core mission is simply the growth 

of NAGA’s crypto-economy. 

• A management owned and growth-driven young international FinTech company with a great 
team of more than 120 people. 

• NAGA owns various EU-financial licenses, including an asset management license and is 
built on a state of the art legal setup.  

• In partnership with NAGA’s shareholder, the Chinese Fosun Group, the first steps for an 
expansion into the Asian markets have already taken place. 

• With NAGA TRADER, NAGA has an existing product generating multi-million USD in yearly 
revenues, driven by thousands of users and featuring its own robo-advisor called CYBO.3 

• With Switex NAGA has a virtual item exchange in alpha phase based on a partnership with 
leading players in the industry, including a DAX30 company.

• With NAGA TRADER , NAGA has won awards at Finovate Europe (one of most important 
FinTech awards). NAGA TRADER  also won the Digital Top 50 award, the A to Z Award as 

best Social Trading Platform, and the Red Herring Award.  

• NAGA is backed by the largest private investment conglomerate from China, FOSUN4, who 
is NAGA AG’s main shareholder and NAGA is further supported and backed by widely known 

investors, institutions and advisors such as one of the oldest private banks in Germany, 

Hauck & Aufhäuser (founded in 1796).5

The below illustrated roadmap will be explained in detail in the upcoming chapters. Essentially this 

Whitepaper will explain NAGA’s main assets, the idea and advantages of the NAGA Coin, as well as 

its economic concept and the people and advisors who will make this all happen. It will also talk 

about the token sale, market research, and provide a detailed outlook for the next 18 months. This 

paper will show how the vision of NAGA, combined with a strong economic model, will allow over 2 

billion underbanked people to take part in the most powerful and largest industries worldwide: The 

financial and gaming industries.

2. INTRODUCING NAGA 

2.1 THE COMPANY 

After performing one of the fastest IPOs and being listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on July 

the 10th 2017, The NAGA Group AG (ISIN: DE000A161NR7) is currently offering two platforms 

around the trading of financial instruments and virtual items. Founded with the mission to make 

financial transactions in stocks, cryptocurrencies and the gaming market more transparent, secure 

and accessible to everyone, the NAGA team stands for disruptive and innovative solutions in the 

online trading and gaming world. The first venture of NAGA is the online trading platform and social 

network for traders, NAGA TRADER , which has been operating since early 2015. The NAGA TRADER  

trading platform accommodates thousands of registered users and facilitates several thousand 

transactions each month. The second venture, Switex, is currently under development and will be 

launched in Q1 2018 (Beta version).  

 

Figure 3: NAGA Ecosystem 

NAGA has a CySec-regulated brokerage firm and asset management company within the group 

called NAGA Markets Ltd. (former Hanseatic Brokerhouse Global Markets Ltd.), which is based in 

Cyprus and specializes in Forex and CFD trading. Furthermore, NAGA’s sales and lead-generating 

engine HBS AG (Hanseatic Brokerhouse Germany & Spain) focuses on the acquisition and support 

of traditional customers in the trading segment. NAGA TRADER  (available for Ios, Android and Web), 

which is directly connected to NAGA Markets Ltd., supplements the company’s product offering and 

allows customers to access a more modern and mobile-oriented trading platform. NAGA TRADER ’ 

technology solution also offers open interfaces for other third-party brokers6 which are able to ben-

efit from the company’s technology. Depending on the strategic orientation, NAGA therefore can 

expand its own ecosystem through its own network, as well as through a stronger involvement of 

partners. 

Next to NAGA TRADER , NAGA’s second venture Switex also embodies enormous disruption poten-

tial and is the ideal addition to the ecosystem as it allows for the connection of the financial trading

world with the gaming world. With several offices across major European countries, including Ger-

many (2 offices in Hamburg), Spain (offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Palma de Mallorca), 

and Cyprus (Limassol), NAGA today has access to more than 20,000 paying clients from more than 

100 countries.  

Within its ecosystem, NAGA combines elements of social media networks (chats, channels, video 

and add server, follow and watch functions) in its products alongside the more classical approach 

of trading. Users of the platform produce daily contributions (so-called “User-Generated Content”) 

without NAGA paying for it. Similar to platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook, the commu-

nity creates and shares content themselves and free of charge, thereby enhancing viral growth 

without incurring any additional costs for NAGA. 

2.2 NAGA’s VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF TRADING 

NAGA doesn’t just believe in decentralized and transparent data but also in the power of decentral-

ized services. NAGA’s vision of the all-in-one platform for financial services is not geographically 

bound by borders. Today’s technology and regulation allows NAGA to create a decentralized third-

party marketplace that brings the leading financial technology to everyone around the globe. The 

trading platform of the future not only offers trading with cryptocurrencies, but also a fully functional 

infrastructure based around blockchain technology, allowing everyone to trade financial instru-

ments as well as virtual products, such as virtual goods. Decentralisation offers the most promising 

path to NAGA’s vision of a sustainable future in online trading.  

Especially over the last years, the global financial markets have become heavily complex; they are 

over-regulated and discriminate against the retail clients who would like to participate. All of this is 

currently changing with the evolution of the blockchain technology, a disruptive economic technol-

ogy that allows every person, even those without a bank account, to participate in the financial 

markets. Combining expertise in regulated markets together with expertise in blockchain technol-

ogy creates unique solutions for online trading that are tailored towards approaching the broader 

market. The power behind NAGA is the NAGA Coin (NGC) or digital token. All activity in the network 

evolves around NGC, from serving as the primary form for fees and collateral, to serving as the 

main base currency for any transactions. NGC shall become the driver of a sustainable economy 

where demand grows as more and more users, financial institutions, and game-publishers join the 

NAGA ecosystem. 

With the NAGA Coin of NDAL, NAGA aims to establish the world’s first crypto-gateway to trade 

stocks, CFDs, ETFs, and any other sort of financial instruments and virtual goods on a global scale 

in a secure and transparent way. NAGA shall become the trading platform for any financial or virtual 

product of the future. It’s time for you to be able to buy any stock or game item with your NAGA 

tokens or other cryptocurrencies, let a personalized and unique robo-advisor, called CYBO, invest 

for you, and build your financial wealth with full transparency and efficiency with low or no transac-

tion costs.  

2.3 TEAM OF EXPERTS 

NAGA’s team combines deep know-how in trading, banking, and blockchain technology with the 

right mixture of start-up spirit and corporate professionalism to bring enthusiastic innovation and 

measurable results to its client’s business processes.

3.  NAGA ECOSYSTEM 

3.1 BUILD TO SCALE 

The NAGA ecosystem already embraces a large number of online trading brokers, financial institu-

tions, (and in the future) even more game-publishers for Switex. NAGA is an open API universe that 

has already proven to be able to handle multiple providers in real time in the most (time) sensitive 

and regulated market. Several providers are already live and connected and allow NAGA to scale 

faster than its peers. After connecting several brokers around the globe, such as FXCM and 

BDSWISS7, NAGA TRADER  is currently in the process of connecting Interactive Broker Inc.8 which 

will allow the company to offer physical stocks on its platform. With a growing number of connected 

providers, brokers and publishers, the NAGA ecosystem will grow exponentially. Together with its 

partners, NAGA TRADER  will form the largest community for stock traders around the globe. It will 

add a peer to peer component to its services and will expand with Switex into one of the largest 

and fastest growing markets worldwide. NGC will literally bring cryptocurrencies and financial prod-

ucts to the masses.  

With 2+ billion users in the gaming industry and by targeting the largest financial market in the 

world (the foreign exchange market (Forex) with 5.1 trillion USD traded everyday2, as well as the 

equity markets with more than 65 trillion USD market 18witex18ualized), NAGA is the first and only 

to tackle those two markets at the same time and is highly prepared for a transformation into the 

crypto and blockchain world. When it comes to the online trading industry, positive future develop-

ment is expected. In recent years, the daily trading volume of the entire brokerage industry has 

risen to 321 billion USD. A further increase of the daily volume is expected in the future.9 Looking 

at the steady increase of users of the leading apps in the social trading and gaming area, the overall 

market climate is very positive.10  

3.2 NAGA ENTITIES  

NAGA identifies itself as a group of FinTech companies serving customers around the globe. NAGA 

is also active in Asia, in which its services/products are already offered, and marketed. As part of 

the Asian initiative of the company, also based on NAGA’s existing relationship with its largest 

shareholder Fosun, connections with Asian based brokerage companies have already been devel-

oped and will be publicly announced in 2018.  

NAGA is committed to creating a system dedicated to social trading and investing in financial in-

struments, virtual goods and cryptocurrencies. NAGA’s goal is to make a complicated market sim-

ple, fun, social, entertaining, rewarding and safe for everyone – especially for 2 billion underbanked 

people.

3.2.1 NAGA TRADER  – the Social Network for Traders 

NAGA TRADER  is a subsidiary of NAGA, offering a unique concept that enables retail clients to trade 

Forex, Indices, Stocks, ETFs and CFDs by copying other traders. The company has been operating 

since June 2016 and currently has partnerships with 8 brokers.11 NAGA TRADER  offers trading 

functionality within the environment of a social network. The platform is thus intended to be more 

appealing to younger users, who have not dared to enter into the complex financial markets world 

before. It opens the trading world to a much broader audience, such as gamers, who can start with 

a virtual demo version. The platform offers an environment to the user in which he/she can share 

knowledge with other users, copy the trades of others, and trade or invest money. Besides the 

option to open an account with NAGA, the product enables the user the freedom to link one of their 

already existing brokerage accounts with NAGA TRADER .  

 

Figure 4: NAGA TRADER  Features 

If a user shares his trades with the community and gets copied by others, NAGA TRADER  pays a 

compensation bonus to the trade initiator. As a result, the NAGA TRADER  trader has the unique 

potential to passively earn money while trading on the NAGA TRADER  platform. The compensation 

is directly credited to the user’s account and can be withdrawn at any time. If a trader decides to 

copy a trade, there is the possibility to copy one single trade or to copy all the trades of a single 

trader (auto-copying).  

NAGA TRADER  provides a stand-alone offering in comparison to other social trading networks, like 

eToro or Ayondo, which just offer the possibility to just copy all trades of a single trader within the 

network. On NAGA TRADER  each trader can be the expert. NAGA TRADER  also offers its users the 

possibility to follow other users, and to subscribe to and comment on news and user interactions. 

In addition, the platform offers a full robo-advisory solution. The algorithms and artificial intelligence 

of CYBO are described below. NAGA TRADER ’ simple and easy to use interface, combined with

3.2.2 Switex– Virtual Goods Exchange   

Switex will be the first legal market eco-system for virtual goods, which will enable gamers, game 

developers and publishers to profit fairly. Furthermore, Switex will enter the immense games mar-

ket with over 1.8 billion gamers13 and over $108 billion14 in revenues worldwide. In light of the fact 

that there are still nearly 50% of the world population15 without internet, the number of gamers will 

most likely increase over the next few decades and the games market will be far more significant 

as new generations grow up with games/gamified content around them. An indication of the hidden 

potential in gaming can be seen in the E-Sports market, which has seen an explosive revenue 

growth in the last few years from $325 million in 2015 to over $696 million in 2017, with the 

prediction that this will grow again to $1.5 billion in 2020.16  

NAGA has set up a 2-step-plan. First, Switex aims to disrupt the gaming industry. Secondly, a mar-

ketplace will be opened for other virtual items. The Switex platform will be the first independent, 

safe and legal virtual goods exchange accessible to all gamers and all publishers equally. Users of 

the platform will be able to buy items for their games from both the publisher and other users of 

the platform, offering a first and secondary market for in-game items. The secondary market will 

allow players to offer their items to other players for sale or acquire the items of others to use in 

their particular games. Switex therefore aims to be both the Amazon and eBay for in-game items.

Any item entering the Switex system will be secured through a blockchain-technology-based system 

and therefore this exchange will be secured against fraud and scamming. The legitimacy of the in-

game items, its origins and the sellers right to sell will be verified and therefore Switex will ensure 

a seamless and safe transaction between users.  

 

Players will be able to transfer their items into and out of the Switex-platform without having to 

worry about security. It can be stated that Switex will provide a legal alternative to the grey markets 

that exist today, where virtual goods (in-game items) can be bought and sold legally. Switex is not 

only a marketplace for offers but also a fully integrated clearance and settlement system which 

ensures that items will be automatically transferred to the new owner’s game – upon the user’s 

wish. In order to manage the virtual goods – regardless of their origin (e.g. games, concert tickets 

or any virtual good) – the Switex platform will always have a direct and secure connection to the 

virtual goods providers. 

 

 

 
 

Figure 8: Switex – Mobile Platform 

 

Currently the project is in alpha and has acquired the first publishers to embrace the platform. The 

open-beta is expected in Q1 2018. The first NGC-related revenues are expected to be generated in 

Q3 2018.

Figure 9: Switex – Simplified Business Model Overview  

Switex will use its own private artificial currency “Switex Coins”, which will enable a legal and safe 

way of buying virtual goods on Switex. Token holders of NGCs will have the unique and limited 

possibility to exchange their NGCs to Switex Coins and thus experience many advantages described 

in the chapter below (“Benefits of NGC usage”). 

3.2.3 CYBO – Robo-Advisory Solution 

In June 2016, the NAGA Team came up with the concept of “CYBO”, an investment robot which 

analyses crowd trading 23witex23u and combines this with artificial intelligence, making it the first 

investment advisor which is driven by human (crowd-based) & artificial intelligence. CYBO is an 

automated, algorithm-driven financial planning service. The idea behind CYBO was the creation of 

a high-end, technology-driven (as opposed to human interference) system that manages invest-

ments. This is achieved in a multi-step process. CYBO learns the client’s personal preferences and 

investment objectives. While the client can adjust his risk preferences and investment objectives 

at any moment, CYBO operates on the most recent and up-to-date information provided.   

CYBO combines decades of experience in the brokerage business with state of the art technology. 

NAGA TRADER  users are offered a unique additional benefit, as CYBO collects, calibrates and com-

putes the intelligence of the crowd and reduces individual client’s mistakes in trading. It helps a 

client to eliminate emotional reactions and missed trading opportunities. CYBO is a script/software 

that runs on a mobile device, desktop or tablet. It was designed in a way to copy the best trades of 

the top NAGA TRADER  traders. CYBO analyses individual traders’ past performance and monitors 

the current positions. CYBO constantly monitors numerous financial and technical market indica-

tors, like market volatility, market trends, price action, upcoming news, and economic events. It 

picks only the best trades that fit the criteria NAGA TRADER  has developed. CYBO’s key priorities 

are the following: 

• Provide the best market opportunities. 

• Control risk and trade more profitably. 

• Diversify between followed traders and selected trading instruments. 



 

 

 

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER 

_______________________________ 

 

24 

• Provide a comfortable way of trading. 

The user decides when to start, pause or completely disable their personal CYBO. Furthermore, the 

user is able to set his/her individual trading preferences. Referring to NAGA TRADER  back-testing 

period between June 2016 and July 2017, CYBO outperformed other peer-to-peer investment ad-

visors. Given an investment allocation of €10,000, a 24witex24ualiz CYBO was able to generate 

an annual return of 24witex24. €1,600 (over 16%). Compared to the best robo-advisory solutions 

available in Germany, which is solely focused on one core product (for example Scalable Capital or 

Ginmon who raised over $50m in Venture capital), they achieved a performance return of 12.1% 

in 201617. Besides the individual advisory approach, it is planned that CYBO will soon be managing 

a “CRYPTO INDEX FUND”, allowing every token holder to benefit.  

 

 
 

Figure 10: CYBO Gets Ready for Trading 

 

In 2017 the idea of managed portfolios and index fund portfolios has been on the rise. To shake 

things up NAGA TRADER  decided to provide its users with liquid exposure to the cryptocurrency 

asset class by introducing a “CRYPTO INDEX FUND” managed by CYBO. This absolute-return in-

vestment product will cover TOP10 potential cryptocurrencies. CYBO will recalculate and re-

balance the INDEX on an automated repeating frequency. The fund’s investment approach is op-

portunity driven and “cryptocurrency-picking”. It is planned to include NAGA Tokens as a refer-

ence for the index-price-calculation and reporting.

NAGA Academy combines the advantages of an always available online academy with those of a 

stationary university. Everyone is welcomed to join its vast programs, which are specifically tailored 

by proven experts and professionals. Its students will have the opportunity to choose their preferred 

courses, according to their needs and in fitting with their lifestyle. Through NAGA Academy’s Degree 

system, it is easy to either learn from scratch, refresh, or even master one of the 4 offered educa-

tional paths.

can be mastered by completing the Degree Ladder, beginning with the Micro Degree. The very first 

Degree gives an overview of the topic and provides the most essential knowledge. Higher Degrees 

provide more insight, diversify the topic in further branches, and go more and more into detail until 

the point where the student has reached both Micro and Macro Degrees, which allows the student 

to apply for an undergraduate program. The NAGA Academy will operate fully within European reg-

ulations and thus the academic degrees will be internationally acknowledged. 

 

Students can also profit from the immense business network of The NAGA Group AG, such as in-

vestors, shareholders and business partners. Internships, on-side case studies and the possibility 

to become a student employee will be the very unique benefits for the students during their studies. 

NAGA’s experts, professors and proven professionals will support the students on their way of 

success.  

 

The goal is to provide education which offers both, theoretical and practical knowledge for students 

and industry enthusiasts in their endeavours to reach the top in the financial markets, FinTech and 

new business sectors (such as virtual goods).

3.2.7 Planned Projects – Peer2Peer Revolution 

NAGA also plans to launch two more ventures solving problems in the industry of online trading. 

Although further details related to the projects cannot be revealed at this stage, the plan is to 

launch a peer-to-peer platform for CFD and stock trading. The transformative feature of the plat-

form will enable sophisticated retail traders to be trading from their own inventory with a mark-

up/down as opposed to acting as the client of an agent who charges a commission.  

NAGA has a mobile application in its pipeline that provides face to face currency exchange by 

matching individuals. By using the app, users will be granted the choice to exchange physical and 

crypto currencies. The app offers a facility to exchange even small amounts of currency. In its next

stage of expansion, the app will allow people to connect with each other and build up a reliable 

network to exchange money globally. 

 

Figure 16: Zero Commission Peer2Peer Trading Platform 

3.3 COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS 

The business model of NAGA comprises the development, marketing and promotion of applications 

in the area of financial technology and online trading. In this respect, there is a risk that other 

companies with (much) more human and financial resources could enter the market as a compet-

itor and could possibly copy the business model of NAGA. These companies could offer more at-

tractive and competitive products and services, showing a longer company history, better estab-

lished customer relationships, and use their experience and resources in different ways in order to 

compete with NAGA, e.g. through acquisitions, aggressive investment in marketing, or the offer of 

more attractive conditions for customers, service providers and business partners. In addition, 

other start-up companies, could get access to equity and debt capital significantly easier than 

NAGA. Aa a result, NAGA might grow slower than expected thus losing its customers to its compet-

itors.  

NAGA offers an operational business unit headquartered in Hamburg with additional operational 

units in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, and Limassol. Future locations in Shang-

hai and New York are planned in order to directly address potential partners in the American and 

Asian market. Based on the project-oriented corporate structure of NAGA, projects are managed 

completely independently from each other. NAGA is able to develop cross-platform applications and 

to provide whole technology interfaces for multiple platforms on desktop and mobile (Ios and An-

droid). The founders of NAGA jointly have long-term expertise and complementary experiences in 

the fields of banking, law and technology (start-up). Due to the cultural diversity of its employees, 

NAGA is highly internationally oriented and is in a position to provide up-to-date technologies, sys-

tem processes and structures, both in IT and business.

Since the start in 2015, NAGA has gained the trust of strong and internationally 30witex30ual part-

ners. In particular, NAGA partners are Hauck & Aufhäuser and Fosun. Existing and future partner-

ships are 30witex30ualize by the exchange of knowledge, technology expansion, and synergy ef-

fects, allowing each partner to benefit from the network. The NAGA TRADER  technology is the cor-

nerstone of all NAGA products. It is adaptive, so that new business models can be implemented 

quickly and efficiently. The prototype for the planned software Switex is based on these modules. 

Thanks to the technological focus of NAGA, numerous new projects and innovative functions can 

be developed in short time periods, allowing the company to move fast and to scale aggressively.  

 

Figure 17: NAGA TRADER  – Competitor Matrix 

The entire NAGA TRADER  system, for instance, is self-learning and has established a “Social Fi-

nance Graph” which is a specifically designed algorithm that combines social-based user interac-

tion with a user’s trading interactions and correlates with the interaction of other users. With each 

interaction of users, be it trading, copying, sharing or consuming content, the system learns per-

sonal preferences of individual users. The collection of user’s social-economic data is used to seg-

ment specific user groups and target their preferences. This approach is key to more effective in-

bound marketing and enhances the scale effects of the platforms. Within the first months of oper-

ations of the NAGA TRADER  platform, the following advantages in comparison to its competitors 

were observed: 

• Customer acquisition is up to 5 times cheaper than the industry average according to in-
ternal evaluations. 

• Customers use the app as a social network and spend an average of 23 minutes per day 
on the platform, (Comparable to Facebook, Snapchat with usage times between 1 and 40 

minutes per day).21 

• Existing users refer new users free of charge through recommendations (so-called viral 
growth). The issuer’s internal evaluations show lower customer acquisition costs com-

pared to competitors.

Figure 18: Switex – Competitor Matrix 

It is estimated that there are around 1.8 billion gamers worldwide.22 As the accessibility to the 

internet highly correlates with the number of gamers, there is still a lot of potential left in this mar-

ket. Also, the increasing dominance of the mobile sector (mobile phones, tablets etc.) leads to a 

wider coverage with gaming enabled products, such as today’s smartphones & tablets. In 2018, it 

is predicted that the mobile sector will outperform the traditional Consoles and PCs sectors in the 

global gaming industry, which will then be worth $112 billion.23 Despite this being such an immense 

and significant market, there are still many rudimentary problems. Fraud, scamming, and money 

laundering are still big issues in the so-called “black-markets” for virtual goods. Gamers who trust 

these kinds of services will most likely suffer from being scammed and lose either their money or 

item because there is no trustworthy system which ensures the transaction.

Switex will solve these issues by offering a legal, trustworthy and easy way to trade items. It is 

estimated that the virtual goods market worldwide is worth over $40 billion (2016).24 The global 

games market has continuously grown with over 8% CAGR since 2013.25 This market in particular 

brings very promising business opportunities for Switex, since there are no other consolidated, legal 

and widely accessible cross-gaming-platform and cross-games-trading platform such as Switex will 

be. Moreover, Switex will always have a direct link to the game publisher and thus ensure a safe, 

legal and convenient way for the gamer to trade items and for the game publisher (or developer) to 

promote new items, activate gamers, and participate in its users’ activity in the vast Switex eco-

system. Switex sees the following points as advantages over similar or black markets: 

• Switex will be the first open, transparent and fair platform for virtual goods. 

• Switex will always have low fees. 

• Virtual goods from mobile games could be transferred to a user with a pc-game (if this is 
allowed by the game publisher). 

• Switex has received huge interest from Asia and is currently in very close discussions with 
big and influential game publishers from that region. 

In Switex’ opinion, the amount of data generated within the NAGA ecosystem in comparison to other 

services, and on the basis of the relatively high daily usage times of users, allows additional income 

through targeted marketing (via its own add-server, i.e., a 33witex33uali tool) and to market ac-

cording to specific user characteristics. Likewise, the data volume leads to faster 33witex33ualized 

adaptation of self-learning algorithms, such as the self-developed CYBO technology, allowing each 

user to automate his trading by using a robo-advisory tool according to their preferences.

4. THE NAGA COIN  

4.1 TOKEN SUPPLY AND SPECIFICATIONS 

A total of over 77 million NAGA tokens were issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart 

contract. NGC complies with the ERC-20 standard and is freely transferable on the Ethereum plat-

form. NAGA tokens do not indicate ownership of a company, NAGA does not pay dividends, and 

NGC holders do not earn any direct interest (which – by the way – qualifies NGC as a Sharia-com-

pliant Islamic investment opportunity).26 The token is an integral part of NAGA’s economy, and its 

value reflects the degree of penetration and activity within the platform. The more NGC are being 

used within the NAGA ecosystem – and thus driving customer adoption – the greater the demand 

for NGC will be. As NAGA’s popularity grows and more users join the platform, new features will be 

released, which will further increase the interest among NGC token holders. The exact details about 

the token creation, the token sale, the distribution as well as the proceed allocation can be read in 

chapter 5. 

4.2 NAGA WALLET 

NAGA will enable the transfer of Tokens via the NAGA Wallet into NAGA TRADER  and Switex and all 

future projects which will be part of the NAGA ecosystem. Every platform user can choose between 

different blockchain assets as a source of payment within the NAGA Wallet. Further, the user can 

conveniently convert a wide range of blockchain assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), 

Litecoin (LTC), etc. from one to another by simply using his personal NAGA Wallet (and of course 

the NGC). NAGA’s application facilitates the storage of all major cryptocurrencies, the easy man-

agement of crypto portfolios, simple transfers of funds between peers, and a multitude of other 

functionalities.

The NAGA Wallet plays a central role in the NAGA ecosystem. It serves as a secure wallet for its 

users which allows the deposit and exchange of cryptocurrencies and fiat money as well as a solu-

tion to invest in stocks or trade virtual goods. The NGC will serve as the universal base currency 

with direct integration into NAGA TRADER  and Switex as well as all upcoming products within the 

NAGA Ecosystem. The web and later mobile application facilitates the storage of all major crypto-

currencies, the easy management of crypto portfolios, simple transfers of funds between peers, 

and a multitude of other functionalities. Moreover, the wallet will be connected to the leading 

crypto-exchanges. 

 

Figure 20: The NAGA Wallet – Overview 

Every crypto investor faces the same problem: opportunities to exchange digital tokens for goods 

and services in our everyday lives are very limited. Buying goods and services with cryptocurrencies 

should be as easy as buying with USD, EUR, or JPY.  

To solve this problem, NAGA introduced the NAGA Debit Card, allowing users to spend their crypto-

currencies in millions of online and offline locations worldwide. In fact, everyone who purchased 

NGC is already an early user of the NAGA Wallet. As it allows users to buy NGCs with BTC, ETH, LTC, 

DASH or with Fiat currencies using their credit card or bank transfer, it is the first Proof of Concept.

The product advantages of the NAGA Wallet are the following:  

• Multi-asset (any blockchain asset compatible with and accepted by the NAGA Wallet). 

• Direct integration into NAGA TRADER  and Switex user accounts and as a payment gateway. 

• Best available foreign exchange and transaction fees (with no other charges). 

• Decentralised and risk-free storage. 

• Dedicated NGC Bonus Wallet inside the NAGA Wallet connected to NAGA Wallet itself, 
Switex and NAGA TRADER . Users will earn a percentage based bonus per transaction vol-

ume made on the mentioned platforms. The exact bonus scheme will be published and 

shaped forthwith. 

• NAGA debit card which will be connected to the NAGA wallet.  

 

 
 

Figure 23: NAGA Debit Card 

4.3 BENEFITS OF NGC USAGE  

The NAGA token will serve as the base currency and decentralized unit of account for all parts of 

the NAGA ecosystem: 

• NAGA TRADER – The Social Network for Traders 

• CYBO – Robo-Advisory Service 

• Switex – The virtual goods Exchange

• NAGA wallet – The Multi-Asset Crypto Currency 

• NAGA Academy – Online Trading University 

The long-term value of NGC will reflect NGC’s adoption and its active user base. Early participants 

who purchase NGC during the token pre-sale will receive the tokens at a steep discount, and they 

will have the opportunity to participate from the start in NGC’s traction and growth. 

Why does NAGA TRADER  require the blockchain technology to become the leading platform to 

trade financial markets? 

1. The safest deposit and trading account in the world – The NAGA Coin totally eliminates 

any counterparty risk against any bank or broker: 

2. Your cryptocurrency is stored within your NAGA wallet without anyone else but you hav-

ing access to it (no money/cryptocurrency is transferred to any third party).  

3. Smart contracts determine available margin to trade. 

4. Your profit & loss is simply being credited to / deducted from your account via trans-

parent and safe smart contracts. 

5. To enable everyone to trade the financial markets without having to open a bank ac-

count or using a credit card company. 

6. To cut out banks that add no value to the user. 

Why does Switex require the blockchain technology to become the leading platform to trade virtual 

goods? 

Fraud and fake items as well as safety and security are the core problems of virtual good markets. 

By signing all virtual goods with the blockchain, Switex ensures transparency and safety, as well as 

a smart contract based distribution of revenues between gamers, publishers and affiliates. The 

blockchain makes the entire Switex ecosystem transparent, efficient and prevents any kind of ma-

nipulation. 

1. Any fraudulent or scam/hack activity is made almost impossible in a network of trust and 

constant validity checks. 

2. Transactions are secured by smart-contracts, encrypted and double verified with external 

nodes. 

3. Any “movement” of data is tracked and thus is reversible.  

4. Enables the user to safely invest cryptocurrencies in virtual goods. 

5. Gamers need a fast and secure way to invest and to get what they want, without the has-

sle of traditional payment methods and the need to involve banks/credit card companies. 

6. User and transaction related data is stored anonymously and in a decentralized way. 

7. Publishers and Switex know as much as you allow them to and other users can only see 

your username – no account data is exposed to public.

Figure 24: Advantages NGC Usage 

The NAGA Coin (NGC) is the backbone of NAGA and will grant its users many advantages and sim-

ultaneously incentivize its holders to use their NGC for every transaction within the NAGA ecosys-

tem.  

4.3.1 Usage as Base Currency  

Token Holders will be able to use NGC as their base currency on NAGA’s platforms. This further 

implies that token holders will be allowed to trade all kinds of financial instruments or virtual items, 

using crypto-currencies. Furthermore, the NAGA Academy will accept NGC, granting users special 

benefits in comparison to “fiat users”. 

4.3.2 Lower Trading Fees on NAGA TRADER  on Every Asset Using a NGC Account 

NGC users will pay 50% less on the trading commissions for each trade they perform on NAGA 

TRADER . If, for example, the fee for an Apple Trade with 100 Apple shares would be $10 using an 

USD account and the NGC/USD rate at the time is 1 NGC = $1, a NGC based account would only 

need to pay 5 NGC in trading fees. 

4.3.3 Cashback per Each Trade Performed on NAGA TRADER  Using a NGC 

Account 

For each trade made (round-turn), the trader would receive – based on the formula below – a bonus 

booked to the NAGA bonus wallet inside the NAGA Wallet. This also applies for trades made with a

CYBO connected to a NGC account, as well as all auto-copied trades. This ensures a passive income 

that is generated with the help of NGC tokens. 

Example: If a user opens a trade and invests 100 USD then he/she should receive a percentage 

of the invested amount as a cashback. The final number depends on the traded instrument, the 

leverage of the trading instrument, and the trading volume. According to NAGA TRADER ’ current 

estimations, users can expect a cashback of 0.01% to 0.05% per trade based on the invested 

amount. The exact numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER  Terms & Conditions and will be updated 

on a regular basis.27  

4.3.4 Double Crediting of Copy Bonuses on NAGA TRADER  Using a NGC Account 

If a user opens and shares trades on the NAGA TRADER  platform using an NGC based account, 

NAGA TRADER  will credit a double bonus to the users NAGA bonus wallet inside the NAGA WALLET. 

If – based on the formula below – a copy bonus would result in $2 and the NGC/USD rate at the 

moment would be 1 NGC = $1, NAGA TRADER  would book 4 NGC to the user’s balance instead of 

$2.  

Especially with the NAGA TRADER  Auto copy feature, this can result in passive income generation 

for successful top traders. The copy bonus is calculated when the user’s trade gets copied and 

opened on the copying users Live Account and is further determined by the particular closing vol-

ume (round-turn). The bonus amount depends on the traded volume in USD on Live accounts from 

other users. Whenever a user gets copied, he receives a real-time push notification of how much 

Bonus he has made.

The generated income depends on the number of copiers of the trade and the capital that the 

particular trade “moves”. The following formula shows exactly how the bonus is calculated: 

 

Explanation: This multiplier (2) means that NAGA TRADER  pays a doubled Bonus for a round-turn 

trade. 

Note: NAGA TRADER  pays up to $50 in copy bonus per $1,000,000 traded volume. The actual 

amount may vary between $10 and $50 and is subject to the decision of the company. The exact 

numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER  Terms & Conditions and will be updated on a regular ba-

sis.28 

Based on NAGA TRADER ’ historical data, traders have received an average of 0.81 EUR in copy 

bonus per 1 trade which was copied by others (average value). The total amount of the monthly 

copy bonus for NAGA TRADER  will grow based on the number of newly acquired users and the 

virality effect of the network. Exact numbers are subject to the adoption rate of NGC and can be 

taken from the financial model available on the Token Sale website.  

It is further planned that traders can charge NAGA tokens for sharing their trades. If a trader opens 

a trade, he can decide if he wants to share the trade with the community and how much he wants 

to charge in NGC for his trade. When a potential copier sees the trade, he can unlock the copy 

function and copy the trade by paying in NGC for this information. 

4.3.5 Lower Trading Fees on Switex on every asset using a NGC account 

The Switex platforms plans to charge a 10% fee for each purchase on its platform. Using an NGC 

account, token holders will only pay 9% of the equivalent fee. 

4.3.6 Cashback Program Switex 

In Switex, users who have exchanged their NGCs into Switex Coins will receive an extra bonus and, 

thus, a better exchange rate in comparison to users who exchange their Fiat money to Switex coins. 

NGC users will thus receive 5% more Switex Coins. 

4.3.7 Discounted purchase of Ad Credits for the Switex and NAGA TRADER  Ad 

Manager 

Visiting ad.switex.com and ad.NAGA TRADER .com respectively, NAGA TRADER  and Switex will ac-

cept NGC as payment method for its Ad Credits. Based on the scheme below, it is planned to allow 

marketers and advertisers, as well as users who want to gain more visibility on the platform, to 

purchase more clicks and impressions on the Switex and NAGA TRADER  platforms. Users are able 

to target their traffic based on various attributes, such as country, platform, age, income level, and 

placement inside the app.

Figure 26: Example Calculation Advertisement Credit Scheme 

4.3.8 Community Status and Access to Paid and Premium Content  

Token Holders will get a more prominent status, so that their profiles are better ranked and more 

visible than the profiles of others. Their trades will be ranked better and they will get access to 

educational material, closed groups, and promotions activities that will be not disclosed to regular 

Fiat money platform users. 

 

Switex will offer token holders who successfully obtain an item on the platform a premium virtual 

good which can only be used within Switex for unlocking premium content and receive access to 

the newest games/new in-game-items. Furthermore, token holders will benefit from discounted 

and/or free access to NAGA Academy courses and online degrees. 

4.4 SMART CONTRACTS FOR BONUSES 

All bonus calculations and transfers are handled by the NGC Bonus Smart Contract, which will be 

published alongside the integration for NAGA TRADER  and Switex respectively. 

From all connected platforms, there will be a Smart Contract developed for the NAGA DONATION 

FUND. From each transaction on NAGA TRADER, Switex and The NAGA Wallet, the smart contract 

will take a percentage of the transaction volume, and allocate a portion of tokens to the NAGA 

DONATION FUND.  

4.5 THE NAGA DONATION FUND 

The NAGA Donation FUND will be operated by NAGA on the website (https://www.nagadona-

tion.com) and charity projects will be proposed to the token holder community. In quarterly polls, 

all NGC holders will be eligible to decide which charity projects will receive a donation. The projects 

will be assessed by a dedicated team and will include NGOs only. 

4.6 NAGA TOKEN PRICE VARIATIONS   

It is important to understand that the price of NGC will vary over time, based on a number of factors, 

which are outlined below: 

• Organic growth of user demand, 

https://www.nagadonation.com/
https://www.nagadonation.com/


 

 

 

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER 

_______________________________ 

 

44 

• Speculative demand, 

• USD/ETH exchange rate, and 

• The cost of gas within the Ethereum network. 

While NGC will fluctuate in value against fiat, BTC, and ETH, the listing fee will be regularly adjusted 

to track $1. For example, if NGC are each worth $1, then 1 NGC will be needed to reflect the value 

of $1. NGC tokens can be purchased directly within the app, or from other NGC holders on external 

markets (cryptocurrency exchanges, OTC, etc.). NAGA is making these tokens available ahead of 

NGC’s launch at a low initial price in a crowd sale.  

Once NGCs have been used within the NAGA ecosystem, these tokens will be continuously recircu-

lated into the market by selling them on exchanges.  

NAGA needs these funds for marketing and continuous development. Recirculating NGC tokens at 

market price helps to raise their value while engaging the user community. As NGC grows in popu-

larity, and more users join the platform, higher revenues will allow the completion and release of 

new features that are already in development. This will further increase the appeal of the platform 

and lead to higher transaction volumes within the NAGA ecosystem, which will lead to an increase 

in the value of the tokens.

5. TOOLS FOR NETWORK GROWTH 

5.1 A SUSTAINABLE CRYPTO ECONOMY 

For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must become the driver for a sustainable econ-

omy. As NGC is utilised by more users and adopted by more providers, the network effect of the 

NAGA ecosystem and its platforms will grow, building the value of the ecosystem for the benefit of 

long time holders and token sale participants. A successful economy requires NGC to have growing 

demand within the NAGA network. The core focus of the public listed NAGA AG is the acquisition of 

deposits and growth of users for NAGA TRADER , Switex and the NAGA Wallet. As NGC is the future 

currency of choice for these platforms, the NGC is backed and additional NGC demand is acceler-

ated and generated by the multi-hundred-million publicly listed NAGA AG. 

 

Why the NAGA-Crypto-Economy will work: 

 

Like every economy the NAGA crypto universe is determined by supply and demand. The core busi-

ness model of the NAGA Group is to grow their platforms and user base by generating deposits (or 

subscriptions in the case of NAGA Academy). The success of the acquisition of deposits/subscrip-

tions (demand generation) depends on the ratio between customer acquisition cost (CAC) and cus-

tomer life time value (LTV). The main monetary policy measure in the NAGA crypto-economy is 

hence the efficiency and budget for generating users and deposits. 

 

Existing market measures of The NAGA AG:  

 

Based on historic numbers, the current CAC to LTV ratio is around 1:5+ (CAC vs. LTV). The NAGA 

Group AG with its additional traditional access to the capital markets and investors is aiming to 

further increase the marketing focus and enhance the CAC vs. LTV ratio. An additional marketing 

budget will be generated by the proceeds of this ITS. NGC will be lent or paid to third parties such 

as The NAGA Group AG to carry out marketing activities and to generate more users and deposits. 

Marketing will be carried out via viral growth as well as organic growth (acquisitions). This will result 

in higher deposits, NAGA Academy subscriptions, revenues, demand and hence a higher NGC price. 

 

The user centric benefit and bonus system as well as the engaging and social user experience of 

the NAGA platforms further generate organic and viral growth. Furthermore, the re-investment of 

profits generated on the platforms will fuel the marketing activities and hence grow deposits and 

thus demand for NGC (it is crucial to understand that the supply of NGC is limited, therefore the 

demand for NGC, however, is not limited). Furthermore, the NGC utility token has a broad and di-

versified use case fundament that ranges from financial trading via in-game-item-trading, to pur-

chasing multiple benefits, including online education. Since participation in the NAGA ecosystem 

requires users to acquire NGC, demand for the token will grow in proportion to the number of active 

users and the number of transactions they execute.  

 

The ITS proceeds will further allow the network to grow in proportion to the number of active NAGA 

application users who are acquired via a diversified portfolio of marketing channels, incl. cross-

platform selling and potential M&A transactions. Buyers of NGC are incentivised to hold significant 

reserves of NGC in order to participate in the growth of the NAGA eco-system. Aside from spending 

NGC, the model also provides a means of earning NGC rewards for activity on the platforms.

Necessity for a decentralized and democratic solution in the financial trading and in-game-item 

space: 

 

Switex requires virtual goods to be based on blockchain to:  

 

a) Guarantee authenticity of items,  

b) Prevent fraud, 

c) Make transactions transparent, 

d) Make transactions traceable,  

e) Prevent abuse and money laundering, 

f) Allow partners within the ecosystem (publishers, affiliate partners etc.) to participate in the 
value chain and have a transparent way that allows such partners to have an “embedded 

live audit” with regards to any receivables.  

In the eyes of NAGA, the crowd/community and not a central institution needs to have control over 

the ecosystem and its full transparency and safety - as a natural evolutionary process within this 

industry. Most of these attributes will apply to NAGA TRADER  and the NAGA Wallet as well (pub-

lishers are brokers, banks, financial institutions within this context). NAGA believes that trading in 

the financial space will naturally evolve into the blockchain space and that financial transactions 

will governed by smart contracts.  

The NAGA ITS and NGC builds the foundation for NAGA and the NGC to play an important role and 

to secure a seat in the front row of this development. Furthermore, NAGA believes that such crucial 

functions should not be owned/governed by a centralised company but rather the token holders. 

5.1.1 Fully Barrier Free Entry 

In order to allow simple access to every user, both NAGA TRADER  and Switex offer a proven virtual 

trading mode. Clients can access and try out the platforms in a risk and hassle-free environment. 

Furthermore, the platforms and its Joint Venture partners, financial institutions, brokers, as well as 

providers are able to provide welcome credits as an incentive to join the platform. These mecha-

nisms have proven to be very efficient in attracting masses of users and traffic and have historically 

lead to the purchase of NGC (opening “live accounts”) in up to more of 50% of all registered users. 

Within NAGA’s decentralised universe, Joint Venture partners, financial institutions, brokers, pro-

viders and even users (i.e. to attract followers to increase their passive income on NAGA TRADER) 

are able to utilise these mechanisms to increase their follower and user base.    

 

Ever since the inception of Bitcoin, and throughout the entire history of cryptocurrency, one of the 

major barriers to entry for curious individuals has always been converting FIAT directly into Bitcoin 

and other cryptocurrencies. The process usually requires some degree of technical skill and 

knowledge, an understanding of security, and trust in a system which is unlike anything these peo-

ple have previously used. There’s no phone call to a broker to make a trade, there’s no speaking 

with an advisor in an office, and of course there are ways of being swindled. 

 

Currently, the process of buying cryptocurrencies is a tremendous multi-step hassle. Generally 

speaking, it begins with trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin from various platforms (e.g. Bitcoin 

ATM, website, cash-deal), sending it to an exchange (e.g. Bittrex, Poloniex) and then figuring out 



 

 

 

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER 

_______________________________ 

 

48 

how to make a trade for the desired cryptocurrency. These multiple steps can seem complex, in-

timidating, and incomprehensible in some cases. Even for experienced investors with technical 

knowledge, the process of converting FIAT into digital currencies is generally slow, limited, frustrat-

ing, and occasionally risky. Due to these inconveniences, NAGA believes that curious and qualified 

investors are still turning their backs on the crypto-markets and are consequently missing opportu-

nities they would have otherwise seized.  

5.1.2 Transparency and Trust 

NAGA’s crypto wallet is secured by applying the highest industry standards. NAGA works together 

with a leading wallet security provider in the industry to ensure the safety of funds. The funds are 

also secured by a combination of hot and cold storage solutions, which provide further security. 

The ID of the multi-asset wallet is the user's e-mail address and/or phone number. User registration 

automatically creates a blockchain wallet. Access to the user`s wallet is locked by a 6-digit pin-

code and any transfers out from your wallet ARE also secured by a 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) to 

provide an additional layer of security. 

 

NAGA’s number one priority is to provide an open and completely transparent process when getting 

this platform established, so that everyone can understand and appreciate the potential that this 

system will have. For this project to succeed, the diversity of currencies is going to be key, hence 

the large ITS amount. NAGA wants to create a strong and lasting relationship with its customers by 

providing responsive and helpful customer service, complete transparency, comprehensive secu-

rity, and the levels of anonymity that they desire. To accomplish all this, NAGA needs to have a 

thorough referral program that is going to encourage users to report all bugs and any security issues 

that may be present. Due to a strong desire to put forth the best system possible, NAGA still con-

siders the possibility of adding more members to its team to cover areas like crypto security experts 

and the hiring of an outside auditor. 

5.1.3 Liquidity and Volatility 

Unlike any other ITS, the NGC will be used within two eco-systems (Switex and NAGA TRADER  as 

well as future use-cases such as NAGA Academy) out of which NAGA TRADER  is already live and 

generating billions of Euros in trading volume every month. In addition to those concrete use-cases 

it is intended to list the NGC at several Crypto-Exchanges, such as Bitfinex and Kraken. The details 

and exact dates will be communicated during the sales period.  

 

NAGA has already managed to generate a thick and deep market with NAGA TRADER  and intends 

to further enhance these characteristics following its path of exponential growth. As NAGA has al-

ready established a functioning network for real money transactions, the liquidity risk is being mit-

igated from day one by running a “real money platform” in parallel that is linked and connected to 

the NGC. Furthermore, NAGA holds licenses as an EU-regulated financial institution (NAGA Markets 

Ltd.) that allows NAGA to act as a market maker and liquidity provider. Unlike any other ITS provider 

or token issuer, NAGA Markets has a team of 20+ highly skilled and regulated employees with a 

vast background of experience to facilitate such services as a market maker and liquidity provider 

in a regulated and fair environment. The procedures that are currently followed by NAGA Markets 



 

 

 

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER 

_______________________________ 

 

49 

are in accordance with the MIFID guidelines29 to ensure a safe, stable and fair operation of all 

services carried out.  

 

In addition to an already achieved critical mass to operate the platform NAGA TRADER , the linkage 

to the ECR-20 protocol provides exchangeability within the largest crypto exchanges and hence 

ensures sufficient and deep liquidity which naturally leads to lower volatility. The liquidity should 

furthermore naturally become deeper with Switex which in addition to the above mentioned primary 

market adds an additional pool of liquidity with the introduction of the Switex peer-to-peer second-

ary market. The ability to have access to an EU financial markets regulated market maker and 

liquidity provider, as well as the backbone of high volume trades worth billions per month and two 

use-cases, clearly differentiate the NAGA Token from most ITSs that have ever been performed. 

In addition to these factors to mitigate liquidity and volatility risk the usual procedures offered by 

all other token generators, such as using the ECR20 protocol and having the token listed on all 

major crypto-exchanges contribute to the portfolio of simultaneous risk mitigation strategies.  

5.1.4 NGC Monetary Policies 

NAGA will use smart contracts to limit the lifetime of certain bonus tokens or tokens held with 

specific partners, users, market makers, publishers or providers. This self-devaluation as well as 

NAGA´s ability to determine such self-devaluation intervals will allow NAGA to subsidise, promote 

and fuel certain services (or make non-beneficiary areas for the ecosystem less attractive), prod-

ucts or campaigns (i.e. "Welcome Deposit Bonus", "Copy Bonus" or "Referral Bonus").  

The limitation of lifetime is achieved by re-allocating such NGC tokens into the i.e. Donation Fund. 

By limiting the lifetime of the holders of such tokens they are highly incentivised to then immediately 

use such tokens for the desired transaction and service. Hoarding tokens (which is unattractive 

and undesirable to every economy) becomes less attractive or impossible. NAGA aims to further 

grow and stabilise its ecosystems by implementing such "smart contract based monetary policies" 

("SCBMP"), primarily applied by setting devaluation intervals and restricting the use of tokens for 

specific services or to specific holders only). Changes of SCBMP can lead to tokens being used to 

fuel the ecosystem in the desired areas and grow it. SCBMP also has a high impact on liquidity, 

volatility, and spreads. SCBMP is an active steering and controlling tool that can subsidise certain 

areas of the ecosystem such as virality, growth, trading volume, referrals, bonuses etc. 

Whoever wants to use NAGA TRADER  or Switex (or the NAGA Academy) will need to buy NGC. 

Hence, there should be a naturally increasing demand. Even though there is still the fiat-platform 

world, the NGC user benefits from various advantages, first and foremost from participating in a 

decentralised, safe, democratic, transparent and safe blockchain-based economy. Naga has 

proven to be able to consistently raise client`s deposits, which will soon be raised in NGC primarily 

or in Fiat which NAGA then will convert into NGC. NAGA will try to convert “Fiat users” into NGC 

users over time.

But like every economy, the NGC crypto economy requires an adjustment mechanism. This task is 

being performed by a discretionary Monetary Reserve pool. It is based on all NGC held by NAGA, 

plus a certain percentage of the generated revenues.  

The discretionary Monetary Reserve Pool can be used to: 

1. Ensure sufficient NGC liquidity. 

2. Create a market uplift (by buying or holding NGC). 

3. Prevent an overheated market (by selling NGC). 

The instruments are for example the following: 

1. Token buy-back programs (i.e. by using ITS proceeds). 

2. SCBMP (see above – by limiting the lifetime of i.e. bonus tokens). 

3. Market Repurchase Dividend Buy Back – i.e. buying back NGC with a premium to the cur-
rent market rate. 

4. Giving loans to user run market makers (see chapter peer2peer Trading Platform) – and 
letting them register as market makers. This increases liquidity, increases competition, and 

hence reduces spreads (by creating numerous decentralised user run liquidity providers). 

5. Install a dynamic exchange rate multiplier (NAGA reserves the right to introduce an addi-
tional sub NAGA TRADER /Switex coin in the event of extreme volatility with a dynamic ex-

change rate multiplier in order to provide a stable base currency for its platform. The utility 

benefits of the NGC remain unchanged for the user). 

5.2 PERENNIAL PLATFORM GROWTH 

Being traded and used on several internal as well as external marketplaces, platforms and ecosys-

tems carries a risk of high volatility, including inter-platform arbitrage. Both carry significant risk as 

well, as the opportunity to trade the NGC for price difference only. Subscribers should be aware of 

market risk as well as liquidity risk. Although NAGA intends to use the majority of the proceeds of 

the ITS for driving volume and traffic to the platform, there is no guarantee of the sufficient (or any) 

liquidity of the NGC.  

One of the most crucial user benefits and embedded functions for viral platform growth is the Fol-

lower Bonus paid in NGC.  Users can monetise their skills and earn NGC by posting attractive trades 

or strategies on NAGA TRADER  and get paid per follower or auto-copier. Users can hence earn NGC 

by generating their own community of followers. This feature has also proven to increase the virality 

of the platform. The user’s incentive to generate passive and steady income from followers if they 

constantly post and share sustainable trades and strategies generates visibility even beyond the 

borders of the NAGA TRADER  eco-system. NAGA TRADER  currently supports sharing functions into 

the largest (social) networks worldwide (i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp). The niche of a “Facebook for 

Finance” has yet to be taken on and NAGA TRADER  currently boasts a vast variety of features that 

can usually only be found in major networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or What´s app. 

These features will also be integral parts of the NAGA Cryptocurrency trading and investing services.  

 

By combining these features with a highly latency optimised real time data infrastructure connect-

ing the largest trading exchanges, NAGA TRADER  has an optimal foundation to grow both by intrin-

51 

sic user activity (triggered by sharing motivated through follower/auto-copier bonuses) and exter-

nally by investments in marketing or acquisitions (with its IPO The NAGA Group AG has created an 

acquisition currency (the NAGA Group AG share).  

 

The follower-bonus on NAGA TRADER  hence generates a concrete incentive – credited in real time 

to the user’s wallet- for the individual user at the same time as being the engine for exponential 

and viral growth of the community. Unlike conventional asset management or advisory services 

that are usually centralised in their nature, the NAGA TRADER  eco-system allows every user to 

publish his trade or strategy and get paid in NGC per follower and per copied trade. In addition to 

human users following and generating passive income, NAGA TRADER ´ algorithm based “CYBO” 

also triggers bonuses for users if and when CYBO follows and copies a user. 

 

NAGA TRADER  has successfully implemented this proven leader/follower system in 2016 with 

hundreds of millions of USD in volume traded every month and this system already generates thou-

sands of EUR for users from more than 100 different countries. Single users have made more than 

10,000 EUR in copy bonus per month and are already managing funds exceeding 1m EUR. By 

bringing the leader-follower logic to the world of crypto currencies and smart contracts, NAGA 

TRADER  is opening an additional segment to grow its community. It allows users to build their sub-

communities and to foster and grow them by allowing users to directly connect and use the in-app 

real time chat and messaging features as well as scoring and rating services (NAGA Guard). The 

NAGA Token based follower/leader system is a core component of the NAGA TRADER  eco-system 

and enables the platform users to make their participation in this crypto economy a factual income 

generating profession.

6.2 ROADMAP 

The further Development of the NAGA Platform consists of three tracks:  

 

• Technology development 

• Legal and licensing development 

• Community and business development 

 

The technology development track is dedicated to creating not only the smart contracts for NGC 

and its ecosystem, but also all the necessary infrastructure for fund administration, reporting, anal-

ysis, and integration with publishers, banks and brokers. Thanks to the extensive experience of the 

NAGA team in the development of trading platforms and the setting up of API connections with 

lending companies, these tasks rest on a solid foundation of expertise and successful track record. 

 

On the legal and licensing track, NAGA legal and executive teams will focus their efforts on setting 

up a fully transparent, licensed where necessary, and auditable structure, making sure that the 

envisioned structure is fully compliant with regulations. To do this, NAGA will perform in-house re-

search as well as contract with reputable legal firms.   

 

On the community and business development track, NAGA will continue its aggressive expansion 

strategy, sign new partnerships and build a strong international brand. Partnerships with leading 

online marketing agencies and consulting companies will accelerate NAGA`s future expansion 

plans.  

 

The funds collected in the token sale are used to meet predefined milestones in NAGA’s product 

roadmap as outlined below. The mentioned dates are the earliest dates possible. The milestones 

provide today’s view of the market needs. Due to the fast-evolving nature of the blockchain ecosys-

tem these milestones are indicative. NAGA commits to these milestones regardless of the outcome

of the token sales and total funds collected. As NAGA is already publicly listed and has a running 

business with an EU licensed brokerage, billions of $ in traded volume every month, and several 

offices around Europe, NAGA intends to use the proceeds mainly to expand the ecosystem, acquire 

millions of users, and build a powerful engine for NGC holders. Besides Marketing, Business Devel-

opment and diligent work on Legal & Regulatory, NAGA foresees the following roadmap on the 

product side: 

 

NAGA commits to build the following projects based on the raised amount in the ITS:

NAGA MARKET GUARD 

Looking at websites, such as coinmarketcap.com, which have 80 to 100 million users, to analyse 

the momentum of specific coins, there is clearly high demand for detailed learning about the spec-

ifications around the various tokens which are being issued nearly every day. NAGA believes that 

crypto Investors need a place to learn about tokens in-depth, instead of solely looking at the market 

cap or traded volume. 

Together with its partner Finery, who helped NAGA TRADER  with the development of its crowd & 

market-intelligence based robo-advisor “CYBO”, NAGA is already working on a sophisticated solu-

tion which allows users to evaluate a special risk score around tokens on the market, called NAGA 

Market Guard. NAGA thinks that there is too much scam around tokens, currencies and exchanges 

in general. Thus, NAGA partially sees itself on a social mission for its users to save them from suspicious 

players in the market.

Figure 35: NAGA Market Guard – Landing Page 

With NAGA Market Guard, NAGA will use advanced machine learning and data mining techniques 

and benefit from deep expertise in market microstructure in order to realise investment opportuni-

ties for retail clients, B2B algorithmic-traders, and brokers. With a normalised real-time market data 

feed from a number of venues, plus risk indicators, there are three core products NAGA wants to 

offer if the minimum funding goal of USD 50,000,000 is reached: 

EXCHANGE GUARD 

• Market statistics  

• Probability of default  

• Liquidity  

• Market manipulation  

• Arbitrage opportunities  

• Type of flow  

• Venue ranking 

 

TOKEN GUARD  

• Currency/Token statistics  

• Market manipulation  

• Liquidity  

• Real supply/demand

• Blockchain stability  

• Correlation with BTC/passive portfolio  

• Token ranking  

 

PORTFOLIO GUARD (direct integration into NAGA TRADER ) 

• Investment profiling  

• Recommended portfolios  

• Gainers/Losers  

• Back-testing + statistics  

• Tracking of portfolios 

• Leaderboard 

 

The NAGA Market Guard is planned to be implemented as an essential part of the NAGA Wallet, 

allowing users to analyse tokens in-depth and trade them instantly on the future NAGA Exchange. 

Given the rich data set generated from NAGA TRADER  and Switex transactions, as well as the 

access to real-time market data worldwide, NAGA believes it will be able to offer a complete eco-

system from market research through to direct execution.  

 

NAGA plans to develop and build a fully regulated and holistic exchange that allows its users to 

invest fiat, crypto currencies, as well as gaming items, into any virtual asset offered in the ecosys-

tem. Given the fact that NAGA has a track record, its own payment gateway and conversion service 

connected to multicurrency wallet, as well as an EU-regulated brokerage that can serve over 100 

countries in the world and already running platforms, the vision is to have a one-stop solution for 

investors of any liquid asset class globally - The NAGA Exchange. Moreover, NAGA plans the launch 

of peer-to-peer liquidity project in 2019, embodying the creation of a decentralised and democratic 

market maker and liquidity system. v 

6.3 FINANCIAL FORECAST 

NAGA’s financial forecast is primarily based on certain core assumptions (customer acquisition 

costs, life-time-value, conversion rates and other central metrics that are based on historical com-

pany data). Where available, NAGA has based the assumptions on real performance data. To allow 

ITS investors a completely transparent and unbiased assessment where such real performance 

data is not available NAGA has published an in-depth scenario forecast simulation model sheet. 

This sheet allows investors to adjust all relevant assumptions via a dashboard and analyse such 

adjustment effects directly and live within this sheet.  

 

Potential Investors can access this scenario forecast simulation model sheet under resources pub-

lished on the Token Sale website (www.thenagacoin.com). The financial forecast provides an out-

look to the post-ITS financial projections based on the most current indicators and expected reve-

nues. The forecast also provides long-term projections and in-depth analysis of the demand and 

revenues that will be the main driver for the value of the Token, and the monetary advantages 

realised by Token holders.

The funds raised will not only help us fulfill major milestones (as described in the roadmap), but 

also helps us generate more revenues by allocating the funds in direct value driver activities. Each 

additional product or feature that will be developed will also improve the overall strength of the 

NAGA ecosystem and add extra value to the NGC. Around 50% of the raised funds will be allocated 

to user acquisition (organic & M&A) and marketing activities, which will significantly increase the 

number of live accounts and deposits on NAGA’s platforms. This will have a major effect on the 

revenues generated, and boost NAGA’s established and already functioning business model even 

more.  

 

Since NAGA  already has an existing business with millions of EUR in revenues and several thou-

sand paying customers, the financial forecast also considers organic growth effects. Unlike other 

ITSs, the funds raised by NAGA will be used to scale an already well-established business model 

aiming to achieve a unique position in the market. Just a fraction will go towards operational and 

platform expenses and development. The major part of the funds will go to direct revenue generat-

ing activities. Regarding the token value, NAGA assumes that natural supply and demand will be 

balanced and additional demand will be stimulated by further company growth and through the 

generation of new accounts for NAGA TRADER  and Switex. 

 

Any increase in the number of live accounts (NAGA TRADER & Switex) will thus have a direct effect 

on the revenues generated as well as on the demand for NGC. This will boost the overall NAGA 

ecosystem and will drive additional value and monetary advantages to the token holders. Similarly, 

the development and integration of new products and features with a higher margin will also con-

tribute to the total value. According to NAGA’s estimates, even in the most conservative scenario, 

the overall performance will be very positively affected, taking into consideration the growth accel-

erating effect of the ITS proceeds that adds to the current existing growth rate of NAGA’s business.  

Please bear in mind that all the numbers are assumptions based on a moderate scenario. Benefits 

of token holders are linearly associated with the number of users and volume of payment through 

NAGA’s Platforms. This means that the token holder will get a considerable monetary advantage 

for using NGC.  

Please also note that potential revenues from NAGA Wallet, NAGA Academy, and other planned 

NAGA projects are excluded in the financial forecast. NAGA further does not consider the re-invest-

ment of earnings into marketing in order to keep the financial model simple and understandable 

for interested investors.  

6.3.1 Increase in the number of Live Accounts 

The funds raised from the initial token sale will allow NAGA to focus on customer acquisition activ-

ities through targeted wide spread marketing campaigns and business development efforts. This 

will ultimately drive the number of live accounts on NAGA’s platforms. 50% of the money raised will 

be allocated to marketing & customer acquisition (see ITS proceeds allocation). The increase in the 

number of live accounts will subsequently boost NAGA’s revenues, and NGC demand. The main 

focus of NAGA’s business model is to generate trading volume by increasing the number of live 

accounts and deposits (and NAGA Academy subscriber). NAGA expects a significant increase in the 

number of live account users for both Switex and NAGA TRADER as a direct result of the ITS. This 

will be the main driver of the token demand and subsequently the token value.

6.3.2 Monetary Advantage of Token Holders  

The monetary advantage for token holders is another very crucial element that will drive demand 

to NGC. The Token opens big opportunities to its holders in forms of cash back, fee discounts, and 

additional bonuses that can be collected within the NAGA ecosystem platforms. Token holders will 

have major incentives compared to Fiat currency users on NAGA’s platforms. Details about the 

general benefits of NGC usage can be found in the “benefits of NGC usage” section in this white-

paper.

7. TRANSPARENCY, REGULATORY & RISK FACTORS 

7.1 TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY  

NAGA’s group activities comprise of a large set of activities that may be subject to regulatory scru-

tiny in various territories. The NAGA entities already operate in a highly regulated environment. The 

holding company The NAGA Group AG as a public company listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange 

is subject to all transparency and market abuse regulations according to European legislation. The 

groups brokerage company NAGA Markets Ltd. is licensed as a financial services provider under 

supervision of the Cyprus security and exchange commission.  

This implies that not only the companies’ operations, namely its dealings with client funds but as 

well its personnel with respect to running a financial services institution are under constant super-

vision and control. Although the regulatory environment for companies and groups operating with 

tokens and cryptocurrencies of its customers is not yet clearly defined, the fact that the NAGA Group 

already has to comply with various compliance, transparency as well as regulatory rules, provides 

the groups customers as well as participants of the token sale with the most secure environment 

so far available for token generating events or initial coin offerings. 

The legal structure set up for the token sale has been and will be constantly reviewed and approved 

by the groups legal advisors to ensure that they are compliant with the existing laws and regula-

tions. As far as the group or its advisors will encounter legal uncertainties, these will be resolved 

with the responsible regulatory bodies involved. By sorting out any legal or regulatory exposures 

from the very beginning, the group is aiming for full transparency towards investors as well as reg-

ulators in order to achieve the highest level of investor confidence as well as legal and regulatory 

compliance possible.     

7.2 REPORTING  

NAGA will provide a reporting structure that gives the token holders full transparency on what has 

been achieved with the proceeds from the ITS as well as the use of the tokens and the status of 

the projects. NAGA Development Association Ltd. will provide the token holders with an annual 

reporting on: 

Balance and assets 

• Crypto currencies held 

• Fiat money held  

 

Use of the Token Sale proceeds 

• Platform development progress 

• Marketing 

• General expenses 

• Other costs according to financial forecast

• Reporting of KPIs, such as monthly users, volume traded, etc. 

7.3 RISK FACTORS 

The purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks de-

scribed below. Before acquiring NGC tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully 

weighs all the information and risks detailed in this White Paper, and, specifically, the following risk 

factors. Please further note that the NAGA project may be subject to other risks not foreseen. 

7.3.1 Dependence on Computer Infrastructure 

NAGA`s dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware, and the Internet 

implies that NAGA can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use 

of your NGC tokens. Despite NAGA's implementation of all reasonable network security measures, 

its processing centre servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins 

or other disruptions of a similar nature.  Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions caused 

by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the 

use of the ITSs tokens. 

7.3.2 Smart Contract Limitations 

Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of an 

experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputation 

and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by an independent third party in-

creases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as any form of war-

ranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the ITSS Smart Contract is fit for purpose 

or that it contains no flaws, vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the 

complete loss of ITSS tokens. 

7.3.3 Regulatory Risks 

Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in 

some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing laws or introduce new regulations regarding 

Blockchain technology-based applications, and such regulations may conflict with the current smart 

contract setup and token concept. This may result in the need to make substantial modifications 

to NAGA`s smart contract, including but not limited to its termination, the loss of NGS tokens, and 

the suspension or termination of all NGC token functions.  

It cannot be ruled out that services and projects described in this document will have to be adjusted 

or modified in certain countries, because of the regulatory environment. It also cannot be ruled out, 

that some services will be impossible to provide in certain jurisdictions.

7.3.4 Taxes 

NGC token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions contemplated 

herein. It will be a sole responsibility of NGC token holders to comply with the tax laws of the juris-

dictions applicable to them and pay all relevant taxes. 

7.3.5 Force Majeure 

NAGA’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circum-

stances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and 

circumstances which could not be prevented by NAGA and shall include acts of nature, wars, armed 

conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged short-

age or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or fed-

eral governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond NAGA's control, which were not in exist-

ence at the time of White Paper release. 

If such circumstances occur prior to the issue of NGC tokens and NAGA is unable to issue NGC 

tokens within one month from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at the 

request of the NGC token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original form of payment to 

the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds were transferred from. 

7.3.6 Disclosure of Information 

Personal information received from NGC token holders, the information about the number of tokens 

owned, the wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law 

enforcement, government officials, and other third parties when NAGA is required to disclose such 

information by law, subpoena, or court order. NAGA shall at no time be held responsible for such 

information disclosure. 

7.3.7 Value of NGC Token 

Once purchased, the value of NGC token may significantly fluctuate due to various reasons. NAGA 

does not guarantee any specific value of the NGC token over any specific period of time. NAGA shall 

not be held responsible for any change in the value of NGC token including the complete loss of 

value of the NGC. Even though the large scale and large magnitude use cases (with a proof of 

concept in billions of Euros already traded every month on NAGA TRADER ) implies deep liquidity 

and hence also lower volatility, there is no guarantee that NAGA will achieve those goals.  

There is no guarantee that users can acquire sufficient NAGA Tokens for their usage within the 

NAGA and external platforms and neither is there a guarantee that users can cash out their NAGA 

Tokens via external platforms. Furthermore, every NAGA Token holder naturally carries the risk of 

volatile exchange rate fluctuations of the NAGA Token towards both other Crypto Currencies and 

Fiat Money exchange rates. 

7.3.8 Bitcoin and Ethereum Volatility 

The NGC token may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends and NGC value 

may be severely depreciated due to non-NGC related events in the digital currency markets. Cryp-

tocurrencies exchange rate volatility may impact the company's ability to provide services at the 

indicated prices. Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve, among other things, judgments 

about the future economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of

which are beyond the control of the NAGA team and are therefore difficult or impossible to accu-

rately predict.  

7.3.9 Lack of funds from ITS proceeds 

NAGA may not reach the target sale amount and may not have sufficient funds to execute its busi-

ness plan. Furthermore, NAGA may not succeed in creating the necessary momentum and ac-

ceptance for the NGC token which may result in low liquidity and depletion of trades. The positions 

and plans outlined in this white paper may be altered as the project progresses. 

7.3.10 Delayed Projects & Competition  

Although the NAGA team believes that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements 

are reasonable, any of these may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, the NAGA team can offer no 

assurances that the forward-looking statements contained in this White Paper will prove to be ac-

curate.  

In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, 

the inclusion of such information may not be interpreted as a warranty on the part of NAGA or any 

other entity that the objectives and plans of the NAGA project will be successfully achieved. Com-

petition may introduce the same or better prediction market solutions and cause NAGA to lose 

market share and eventually fail to deliver on its business goals.

ANNEX 1 – FINTECH INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 

The FinTech industry has gained an increasing importance and economic significance in the last 

few years. The profit of30 investments of global FinTech companies in 2015 increased by around 

75% compared to 2014.31 In 2015 alone, investments in this sector increased by 22.3 billion USD 

in comparison to the previous year. The Federal Ministry of Finance estimates that there are cur-

rently around 346 FinTech companies in Germany alone. Based on historical and expected industry 

growth rates (between 2017-2021), the average annual growth rate for the FinTech industry in 

Germany, is estimated to constitute 9%, based on the transaction value.32 According to the auditing 

company KPMG and CB insights, Germany is the largest FinTech region in Europe.33 Among the 

strongest driving forces of the sector are the topics Blockchain, Robo-Advisory, Insurtech and Digital 

Payments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 40: FinTech Industry Outlook 

In 2015, the European FinTech industry grew in total by 215% compared to the previous year.34 Ac-

cording to a study conducted by Capital IQ35, the areas of "Financial SaaS", "Bank Technology" and 

"Payments" are the most profitable markets in the FinTech sector. In general, the current market

climate for FinTech is considered to be positive.3637 The third quarter of 2016, represented the 

height of the global "VC" investments (Venture Capital) in the FinTech industry, with total invest-

ments amounting to USD 2.9 billion.38  

As of 2017, experts predict that China and the United States will be the future key markets for the 

FinTech industry. The highest forecast of transaction volume for sale or IPO of companies in this 

industry amounts to 1,086,492.5 million USD –for China alone. The US, in comparison, with a fore-

casted transaction value of 1,025,519 million USD, is ranked 2nd.39 With an immense distance and 

a transaction value of 145,105 million USD, Japan ranks 3rd.  

Established DAX companies like Deutsche Bank AG40,41 and Commerzbank AG are also investing 

more and more in these or similar technologies. The interest of those companies underlines the 

current trend and the fact that especially the so-called millennials, (i.e., the population born be-

tween 1980 and 1999) have a strong affinity to new technologies, and have a rising interest in the 

services and products that the FinTech industry offers. Thus, this interest group also acts as a major 

growth driver for the FinTech industry as a whole.424344 

Online Trading and Social Trading 

A positive market development is expected for Forex and CFD trading in the coming years. The daily 

trading volume in the entire brokerage industry enormously increased over the course of the last 

years and is expected to rise even further.

Considering the constant increase in the number of users for the leading Social Trading and Gaming 

apps, the market prospects from the point of view of the issuer are very good and long-lasting. The 

customer group between the age of 18 and 35 does not feel addressed by the “classic offer” from 

brokers, although they belong to the most important target audience of the Social Trading market. 

This target group shows clear preferences for modern solutions.45 46 A modern and technologically 

sophisticated solution (i.e., an App) has the potential to achieve more in a shorter period of time, 

which is also reflected in the growth figures and reviews of comparable companies in the industry. 

In addition, it is also worth underlining the increased requirements for financial services here and 

the increasing preference for digital solutions, specifically in the prosperous middle class, who are 

the premier market prospects. 47

Robo-Advisory  

Robo-advisors are automated software asset managers, which, on the basis of ready-made strate-

gies, offer automated investments of customer funds. These robo-advisors build portfolios out of 

mostly index funds (ETFs). These portfolios usually contain common asset classes such as stocks, 

bonds and occasionally also commodities.49 In comparison to conventional portfolio management 

solutions, such as managed funds, robo-advisory strategies primarily are characterised as lower 

cost structures. In addition, this type of automated system is particularly attractive for younger and 

technology-oriented users.50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 42: Global Robo-Advisory Assets Under Management Growth Forecast 

Robo-advisors were popular in the late 1990s for the first time and have gained in significance 

since 2008. In 2016, there were around 200 suppliers of robo-advisory solutions worldwide, which 

were managing assets of around 224,802 million USD. In the coming years, an annual growth rate 

of around 47.5% is expected in relation to the managed total assets calculated (2017-2021). It is 

predicted that by the year 2020, robo-advisors will manage around 10% of all global assets. It is 

expected that by 2021, robo-advisory managed assets will rise to around 1,063,844 million USD.51

Gaming Market 

The total annual development of turnover in this industry shows an average growth rate of 7% per 

year. This means that by 2019, the gaming market will achieve a total forecasted turnover of 118.6 

billion USD.52 In 2016, the top 25 public gaming companies showed an additional 22% growth in 

sales in comparison to the previous year. When considering the mobile market, growth rates be-

tween 2015 and 2016 actually amounted to 40%. This indicates how Sony, for example, managed 

to increase sales by 45% in the same period. Tencent, by far the biggest gaming group, reported a 

record turnover of USD 5.3 billion in 2016.53 The most rapid growing market segment in the gaming 

area is the "Free to Play" genre (games are provided to the user free of charge, and additional 

content can be purchased such as in-game items), Virtual Reality, and of course, the mobile sector. 

The latter, according to a forecast from 2017, is surpassing the classic computer game sector by 

4 billion USD. In the "Free to Play" genre alone, the games League of Legends and DOTA 2 gener-

ated total monthly sales of over 173 million USD. 

 

Figure 43: Free-To-Play Games Market Growth54 

Considering the described development of the gaming industry, there is a clear trend in the gam-

ing market towards the sale of in-game Items within the free-to-play games. In comparison to the 

classic "Pay to play"-model (i.e. the game that you pay for) the annual and total worldwide sales of 

the "Free to Play" models is at least four times higher. It`s a clearly recognised trend to provide 

the user with a “Free to Play” game and to then encourage them through "Micro Transactions" 

(the purchase of in-game items individually for small amounts) to individualise and customise 

their gaming experience.

ANNEX 2 – INTERNET, BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCIES 

Without doubt, the internet has revolutionised how humans live, communicate, think, and how they 

live their everyday lives. It has turned their very existence upside down. Today, most humans take 

the internet for granted and cannot even imagine their lives without it. The internet was born nearly 

five decades ago, and since then, technology has rapidly advanced by huge leaps. About 15 years 

ago, only 12% of all people owned mobile phones. Now, more than six out of ten persons worldwide 

use a mobile phone. About 15 years ago, one third of the population in developing countries lived 

in extreme poverty, compared to less than 15% today. Facebook, which now has nearly 1.5 billion 

users, had not even been launched then. In another fifteen years' time, who knows how much 

technological innovation and developments society will see, and what changes this will bring? 

Cryptocurrencies offer a fundamentally different way of approaching money and conducting online 

commerce. The development of blockchain-based money solves a number of problems inherent in 

the current financial system. A properly implemented online trading platform with integrated cryp-

tocurrency payments has extensive advantages. 

 

Bitcoin 

 

The first cryptocurrency was the bitcoin. Articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 white paper, 

Bitcoin deals with the «double spending» problem through the use of a shared ledger that is main-

tained by a large number of network nodes. By contriving a system in which it is computationally 

expensive to add a block of transactions to the ledger, but easy for anyone to verify it, Bitcoin makes 

it unlikely for any member of the network to succeed in submitting a fraudulent transaction – and 

it is expensive to try to do so. Thus miners – those tasked with upholding the security of the network 

– are better off acting honestly and maintaining the integrity of the ledger. 

 

Financial independence 

 

Nakamoto's implementation of his white paper effectively removed the need for a trusted third 

party to act as a middleman in online transfers. This enabled real peer-to-peer transactions online 

for the first time ever: a remarkable breakthrough, and a task that many experts had believed could 

not be achieved. Money, which had been centralised for millennia in seigniorage, and for decades 

in terms of the payment system, could once again become purely a tool of commerce rather than 

a way to extract value and exert control. Because Bitcoin transactions take place directly – from 

sender to recipient, and without the involvement of a centralised third party – they cannot be cen-

sored. Once a transaction has been accepted into the ledger, there is no way of reversing it. This 

has a simple but powerful implication: if you want to send someone money, you can. There is no 

authority that can block or reverse the transfer. Bitcoin's financial system restores full autonomy to 

its users. 

 

Low-cost transfers 

 

Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to secure transactions, there are no 

middlemen to keep accounts, and therefore, there are no single entities that can charge fees for 

the service. Miners collectively process transactions and are rewarded for verifying a block with 

both new coins (block rewards, currently set at 12.5 Bitcoins per block) and the smaller fees in-

curred with each transfer. Unlike the legacy banking system, Bitcoin does not recognise geograph-

ical borders. Transferring funds to a neighbour on the other side of the road is as fast and efficient 

as sending money to the other side of the world. While banks and remittance services tend to 



 

 

 

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

74 

charge significant flat fees as well as unfavourable exchange rates between currencies, Bitcoin's 

fees are fixed and low by comparison. Other blockchain protocols tend to charge even lower fees. 

 

Privacy 

Bitcoin's use of a shared ledger to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions also has implications for pri-

vacy. The Bitcoin ledger is fully transparent by design, meaning that anyone can trace transactions 

from one address to another, right back to the block in which the coins were first created. However, 

because addresses are essentially strings of random alphanumeric characters, it is not inherently 

obvious to whom the address belongs. Bitcoin is, strictly speaking, pseudonymous rather than 

anonymous. While data may be leaked in a variety of ways that associate a Bitcoin address with 

other personal information to reveal the owner's identity, by using best practice it is possible to use 

Bitcoin privately. The lack of a trusted intermediary means that no information need to be registered 

to use a Bitcoin wallet. There is no administrative authority to control transactions or to collect user 

data. 

Initial Token Sale (ITS): a disruptive fundraising model. 

Since  of the year 2017, the world has witnessed an explosion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an 

innovative and unique method of financing for startups globally. ICOs are a completely new and 

game changing funding method done by issuing a corporate related token. This rise has challenged 

the conventional venture capital industry in its capacity to finance innovative startups and projects. 

ICOs have increased in popularity with over $2 billion raised since the beginning of 2017. The 

amount raised by startups through ICOs has even surpassed venture capital (VC) funding in the 

blockchain area in the first 2 quarters of 201755. ICOs raised nearly $1.3 billion in Q3 2017 alone 

vs. just around $259 million for early stage VC funding56. Companies have raised at least $2.6 

billion this year via initial coin offerings (as per October 2017). ICOs have already surpassed all 

historical VC investment in the blockchain space, which stands at $1.7B since 2010. Contrary to 

conventional equity funding, ICOs give specific rights to their holders to use or profit from specific 

company related services.

Figure 44: ICO Funding vs. VC Industry 

Startups specialised in Blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, are no longer the only ones to 

use ICOs for their funding. This trend is accelerating spectacularly, with funds raised from ICOs 

breaking new records on a monthly basis. The appeal of cryptocurrencies for investors is due to the 

flexibility and the potential of solid returns that have been been witnessed lately on the market. 

According to coinschedule.com57 there were 46 ICOs in 2016 and around 202 this year (as per 

Oct.23)58. The potentially disruptive funding model of the ICOs give companies the capacity to raise 

money from individuals more efficiently. However, and if we take into consideration the increasing 

exposure that ICOs have been gaining lately, the amount of funding generated is expected to keep 

increasing dramatically in the coming months. 

 

Ethereum 

 

Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralised software platform that enables Smart Contracts 

and Distributed Applications (D-Apps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control or 

interference from a third party. Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language 

(Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to build and publish distributed ap-

plications. The potential applications of Ethereum are wide ranging. 

 

Dash 

 

Dash was launched in January 2014 as Xcoin, and then changed its name to Darkcoin. In March 

2015, Darkcoin was rebranded as Dash. Dash was created as a fork of Bitcoin, which means it 

duplicated Bitcoin’s existent code and made it better by addressing the issues users faced with 

Bitcoin. So apparent flaws and weaknesses in Bitcoin are absent in Dash, making both digital coins

substantially different in terms of efficiency. As an alternative to Bitcoin, Dash provides a faster and 

more anonymous service to its users. 

 

Litecoin 

 

Launched in the year 2011, Litecoin is an alternative cryptocurrency based on the model of Bitcoin. 

Charlie Lee, a MIT graduate and former Google engineer, is Litecoin's creator. Litecoin is based on 

an open source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority. Litecoin 

differs from Bitcoins in aspects like faster block generation rate and use of scrypt as a proof of 

work scheme. 

 

ICO 

 

The acronym ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering. When an ICO is offered by a company, capital will 

be raised through the creation of a new cryptocurrency which can then be bought by investors with 

Fiat money or crypto-currencies. ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding. The big difference be-

tween an ICO and an IPO is the fact that investors in an ICO do not take an actual stake in the 

company, as is the case with an IPO. Investors in an ICO are invested in the company but only 

indirectly though the cryptocurrency that is being created. If the ICO is successful, the value of this 

cryptocurrency is likely to increase and the investors will have made profit. 

 

Smart contracts 

 

Developed by the Ethereum foundation, a Swiss non-profit organisation, Ethereum upends the tra-

ditional approach to offering services on the internet. Instead of building server farms across the 

world – staffing them, maintaining them, and securing them – Ethereum makes it possible to build 

a global computing infrastructure by using a type of coding called «smart contracts». These con-

tracts allocate computing resources across the blockchain and reward those who use their own 

hardware to support the calculations required. With the right skill and hardware, anyone can join 

this effort by creating an Ethereum node and be compensated for their contribution, all without a 

central coordination authority. Ethereum works in a fully decentralised manner, just as the Bitcoin 

blockchain does. Smart contracts are pieces of code, whose execution is ensured by the network 

as a whole, in the same way that Bitcoin's transfers and records of funds are policed by the whole 

network. This means that applications that run automatically can be built, and the reliability of the 

services they offer is guaranteed because there is no single point of failure. Ethereum's smart con-

tracts therefore offer the possibility of an e-commerce platform that has unique properties: privacy 

for both the buyer and the seller, complete freedom from censorship and interference, and very 

low fees for users.
