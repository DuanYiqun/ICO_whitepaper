CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  1

CashBag.co is a transactional cash back aggregator that 
rewards customers with cash back when they shop at 
participating merchants.

The site launched publicly in 2016 and has 135,000 
members and over 500 merchants.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PURPOSE OF THE TOKEN
THE TOKEN SALE

CASHBAG LEDGER SETTLEMENT

The purpose of the token sale is to enable instant settlement 
of cash back rewards by leveraging the Ethereum Blockchain 
for settlement. There are several distinct advantages 
to implementing ERC20 tokens for instant settlement, 
including lowered cost of operations, immutable record 
keeping and global reach and adoption.

CashBag is creating the CBC Token (CashBagCoin) which 
is used to reward members for transacting through the 
platform and enable advertisers to instantly reward 
members for approved transactions. 

Customers earn the CBC tokens by engaging with advertising 
& transacting online.

Advertising services are sold through the redemption of 
tokens. These tokens are earned by the members who 
transact with merchants through the platform.

CashBag is conducting a Token Sale for advertisers & 
early adopters of the technology, issuing 120M tokens 
and intends selling tokens to the value of $15M with a 
maximum cap of $30M.

CashBag will accept CBC tokens for CashBag advertising 
services at the minimum issue price of 0,000166666 ETH 
per token (6000 tokens / ETH).

Utilizing blockchain transaction authentication & smart 
contracts CashBag will revolutionize its transactional 
capability, enable instant settlement, disrupt the market 
and speed up consumer mass adoption. 

CashBag has developed its first generation CashBag 
Ledger Settlement platform as described in the 
whitepaper, and will implement & launch the customer 
wallet, tokenization of advertising and reward redemption 
in early 2018.



Retail ecommerce sales will increase from $1.095 trillion 
in 2016 to $4.058 trillion in 2020, making up 14.6% of total 
retail spending in that year .
 
Unique cryptocurrency wallet user base has grown to over 
5.8 Million unique users in 2017 , excluding wallets held in 
exchanges which may contribute even higher numbers.
  
Between Bitcoin and Ethereum alone there are over 
31 Million unique wallets  and the total cryptocurrency 
market capitalization exceeded $160 Billion in 
October 2017.
  
These trends prove that the adoption of tokens and 
cryptocurrency as a unit of stored value is rapidly 
becoming mainstream.

In a decentralised economy, democratising (rather than 
concentrating) ownership via incentives creates value. 

CashBag.co is a transactional cash back aggregator 
that enables consumers to secure discounts and cash 
back for shopping and transacting online at thousands 
of participating global merchants. For each transaction 
concluded CashBag members earn cash back which is 
collected by CashBag from the participating merchant, 
accrued to the member wallet and paid out in fiat  to linked 
bank or PayPal accounts.  

ABSTRACT
CashBag will through this token issue add a feature 
rich environment to its platform, including an ERC20 
compliant wallet which will enable features such as 
fiat / token conversion, advertising purchases, member 
rewards accumulation and redemption, instant transfers 
and the ability for members to transact both within 
CashBag and with any other ERC20 compliant wallet.

Ethereum underpinning technologies enable CashBag 
to empower its members to own, earn and trade tokens 
without requiring them to understand any of the 
underlying infrastructure. This will drive up adoption 
and use of the token, increase market liquidity and 
enable tradability.

The surge in adoption of cryptocurrencies & tokens as 
an investment and trading class will be exponentially 
increased when non-technical consumers can earn and 
use these currencies without having to understand the 
fundamentals of mining, cryptocurrency, blockchain or 
any other deeply technical terminology.

Utilizing blockchain transaction authentication & 
smart contracts CashBag will not only revolutionize its 
transactional capability but enable instant settlement, 
disrupt the market and speed up consumer 
mass adoption.

HOW CASHBAG EARNS REVENUE
CashBag has partnered with hundreds of global 
merchants and continues to onboard new merchants 
daily. These merchants all agree to share revenue 
based on transactional income generated by CashBag 
online shoppers. Through our direct & network 
integrations with the merchants we’re able to report 
transactions in real-time and accrue cash back savings 
for our members.

Advertisers pay CashBag transactional revenue, based as 
a percentage of the total sales revenue generated from the 
transactions facilitated through our platform.

Additionally, CashBag earns ancillary revenue from 
promotional and marketing opportunities on the website, 
toolbar & in the mobile application.

DESKTOP & MOBILE

CashBag has an Android Application and a Desktop 
Helper App (Firefox Safari Chrome) which once installed 
automatically alert consumers to savings when 
shopping online.

The site is mobile optimized and our Android App (iOS 
launching Q4) enables consumers to browse and search 
for products and services on the go.

CashBag launched in the South African market and 
rapidly gained traction, growing to 135,000 members 
within months. The next step was to expand into multiple 
markets and add multi-currency support including US$, 
GBP, EUR and AUD with more currencies following.  



ETHEREUM 
AS A PLATFORM

CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  4

WHY USE ERC20 COMPLIANT TOKENS

We set out to create a more seamless experience for our 
members, enabling them to earn rewards globally from 
thousands of participating merchants using our simple 
and intuitive website, coupled with an easy to use 
interface to track their rewards and earnings.

Our internal objective was to create a single, stable 
platform through which we could harmonize our reward 
issues, track our member token allocation and ensure 
transparency and accountability with seamless
immediate execution.

We identified Ethereum and its unique ability to leverage 
blockchain smart contracts would cut down on the cost 
and time of authenticating transactions and clearing funds 
to our member accounts.

Furthermore, through our token issue we wanted our 
initial backers to securely purchase redeemable tokens. 
These tokens may be redeemed through smart contracts 
for advertising services on CashBag, at the purchase face 
value, or may be traded.

Ethereum has created an ecosystem where everything 
works together seamlessly using tokens to power the 
network. Ethereum based tokens allows exchanges, 
crypto wallets, and smart contracts to know in advance 
how any new tokens will interact on the system. 

In addition, ERC20 defines six the functions  that allow other 
smart contracts to interact within the Ethereum network 
creating an immutable transactional environment. 

Because of its capacity for smart contracts — and other 
complicated computing capacities — Ethereum is viewed 
as more agile, adaptable and stable. Due to its reliability 
and the growth of decentralized apps (dapps) we felt the 
Ethereum platform was a logical choice. 

With the deployment of our ERC20 compliant wallet 
members could store their tokens, earn rewards in our 
token currency or redeem their cash back rewards 
into tokens.

THE CASHBAG TOKEN ISSUE

CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  5

RATIONALE
CashBag operates in multiple global markets. We have 
a roster of over 150 active advertisers, with more than 
685 in the queue for integration. We expect to expand 
to include 2500 merchants by Q2 2018 as we enter 
more territories. 

Members earn cash rewards when shopping online at 
participating merchants. These cash rewards are paid by 
the merchant and tracked by CashBag through our sale 
tracking integration with each merchant.

New members select from a base set of currencies 
including USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, ZAR with support for more 
currencies being added as we enter new markets.

Our multi-currency wallet tracks shopping activity and 
cash back rewards across all supported currencies and 
allocates cash back to members in their base currency.

Members can earn CashBag sponsored incentives based 
on their activity, transaction volume and social sharing of 
the platform.  

WHY UTILIZE BLOCKCHAIN?

By integrating our wallet to blockchain settlement we 
create a mechanism to speed up cash back settlement 
and incentivize our members by allocating them a token 
with a real world supported value which can be traded, 
redeemed and used across any ERC20 wallet 
supporting partner.

The intent is to differentiate CashBag by offering our 
members an easy to use and understand cryptoasset, 
which will be mass promoted as a rewards token.  

Members will earn tokens in addition to cash back, paving 
the path for mass adoption as consumers will have a way 
to ‘earn’ tokens just by shopping from our partners.

The token will drive customer adoption and new customer 
acquisition as we’ll incentivize members to sign up and 
earn tokens by spending through the platform. This will 
result in an increased revenue and associated profitability.

Advertisers will use the token to purchase advertising & 
incentivize customers through the CashBag platform. 

Members can opt to receive their cashback in their native 
currency or convert at ruling market price to CashBag 
Tokens and store their savings in our ERC20 
compliant wallet. 

Similarly, they can cash in their CashBag Tokens and 
receive fiat payments in their native currency.

TOKEN USE CASE

CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  6

THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMERCIAL AND END USER APPLICATIONS FOR THE TOKEN. DEPENDING ON THE USER 
REQUIREMENTS, THE TOKEN CAN BE USED EITHER TO STORE OR TRANSMIT VALUE OR REDEEM FOR SERVICES 

WITHIN CASHBAG. TOKENS ARE REFERRED TO AS CBC (CASHBAGCOINS)

EARNING INCENTIVES
CashBag members earn CBC each time they transact via 

the CashBag platform and purchase from a participating 
merchant. Initially, for every $1 or local market equivalent 

earned in cash back rewards the consumer will earn an 
additional 10% bonus ($0.10) in CBC.  

BUY TOKENS 

PAY FOR ADVERTISING ON CASHBAG
Merchants and advertisers offering services and products on 
CashBag can pay their advertising fees using CBC.

Advertising is paid in tokens and the token sale early adopters 
are guaranteed their US$ equivalent token value in advertising 
services in their local market.

As token value increases any redemptions will be valued at current 
market prices, effectively guaranteeing a discounted rate on 
advertising in the platform for early crowd sale adopters.

GAMIFICATION / REWARDS
Members may earn CBC for acting on and sharing curated advertising 
content ranging from news stories to videos, movie or product launches. 
On our platform, the end user benefits directly from viewing and engaging 
the content and is no longer considered just a product, but becomes an 
active participant in the transaction process.

WALLET
CashBag members can request / send CBC between 
members and pay for services on the platform. The 

wallet is ERC20 compliant so funds can be transferred 
out of our ecosystem and used in other wallets.



CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  7

DEBIT CARD
The addition of a linked VISA / Mastercard debit card will 
enable members to transact globally, using CBC to purchase 
at real world merchants, withdraw cash and instantaneously 
access their funds using just in time (JIT) funding.

SENDING TOKENS / MAKING PAYMENTS
The token can be used to send tokens to CashBag members or 

make payments through smart contracts initiated by users on the 
CashBag platform and beyond. Within the CashBag marketplace 

members will be able to gift tokens, pay for services, buy products 
from the CashBag marketplace and eventually purchase goods 
from integrated merchant partners who accept payments from 

ERC20 wallets in general and CashBag specifically.

TRADING THE TOKEN
The token can be freely traded, exchanged and sold. CashBag will 
honor the crowd sale issued tokens for advertising services at the

for purchases.

OUR ADVERTISER 
BUSINESS CASE

CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  8

The token can be used to purchase advertising 
inventory on CashBag by redeeming it through the 
advertiser interface. The token is transferred through 
a smart contract in return for advertising services and 
the services are delivered through the platform.

During the initial token sale the minimum redemption 
price will be guaranteed through a smart contract, so that 
the token can be redeemed against advertising at a future 
date up to 48 months, at the issue price.

USING TOKENS TO BUY 
ADVERTISING INVENTORY
Ad inventory is available in various formats including but 
not limited to Product Listings;  Merchant Store Listings; 
Display Advertising; Location Based Advertising; 
Coupon Redemption.

“Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.”
Simone Weil, Philosopher  

PRODUCT / STORE LISTINGS
In this relationship and advertiser integrates their 
ecommerce or physical in-store Point-Of-Sale solution 
to credit members who purchase using either a member 
referral link (pre-coded to identify the member), a uniquely 
identifying coupon or the linked debit card.

Advertisers will predominately use CBC to pay for 
transactional advertising, commissions and rebates on 
sales generated as well as promotional advertising space, 
newsletters and incentives to members. 

IN APP & WEB ADVERTISING 
In this relationship merchants can reach consenting 
members with targeted advertising, relevant to their 
prolife, interests and needs. Direct recipients of the 
advertising earn CBC for viewing and acting on the 
advertising, effectively driving up engagement and 
rewarding members for their attention.

Members can change their interests, opt out of the 
advertising entirely or by category, interest or advertiser, 
mute the advertising for a period or any combination of 
the above.

LOCATION BASED ADVERTISING
In this relationship merchants can reach consenting 
members with location geo-fenced notices delivered via 
mobile devices, relevant to their interests and needs.  
Recipients of the advertising earn CBC for viewing and 
acting on the advertising, effectively driving up engagement, 
rewarding members for their attention and action.

Members can change their interests, opt out of the 
advertising entirely or by category, interest or advertiser, 
mute the advertising for a period or any combination of 
the above.



INCENTIVISING MEMBER USAGE

Members earn cash rewards as per the merchant 
agreement for every transaction undertaken through the 
platform additionally earn a token incentive at a fiat 
10:1 ratio, which is funded from our transactional 
revenue stream.

So, for example.  If Mrs. Jones purchases a $1000 item 
from Walmart and the cash back amount payable is $50, 
Mrs. Jones will receive $50 + $5 value in CBC at current
market price.

THE MEMBER HAS THE OPTION TO RECEIVE 
PAYOUTS IN:

All in fiat (CBC will be immediately traded and cash 
equivalent held in their CashBag account until payout)

CashBag rewards in fiat and incentives in CBC

All in CBC

Any withdrawals requiring conversion of CBC to native 
currency will be done at ruling market prices and will 
attract published transaction processing fees, which may 
vary depending on market and withdrawal method used.

TOKEN TECHNOLOGY

Transactions are recorded using our proprietary beacons 
and web / instore tracking technologies linked to the 
advertiser Website and Point-Of-Sale.

B

C

D

Consumer (C) visits either a linked website or 
POS and transacts online.

The consumer is identified as a CashBag 
member through our technology.

The transaction is captured to the CashBag 
Ledger (CBL) by the integration onto 
Advertiser (A).

On receipt of an approved transaction the 
CashBag Ledger (CBL) executes the smart 
contract and pays the consumer (C).

A

The CashBag Token (CBC), a token based on Ethereum, 
is an important element of our marketplace. Ethereum 
is an open source, blockchain-based, distributed 
computing platform oriented towards smart contracts. 
Effectively, Ethereum is a distributed virtual machine 
that allows end users to construct smart contracts for 
transactions. Smart contracts are stateful applications 
stored in the Ethereum blockchain.

These contracts are cryptographically secure and can 
verify or enforce performance of the contract. Token 
contracts are a standard feature of the 
Ethereum ecosystem. 

Ethereum has been used for mobile payment systems, 
distributed exchanges, tokens pegged to commodities

and fiat currencies, market clearing mechanisms, 
micropayment systems for distributed computing 
resources, commodities and securities exchanges,
crowdfunding, and legal document verification. Large 
firms have invested in and deployed Ethereum with 
Deloitte, IBM, JP Morgan, Luxembourg Stock Exchange, 
Microsoft, RBS, and Santander Bank being key 
early adopters.

Micropayments of cash back rewards & incentives from 
advertisers to consumers using CBC will be accomplished 
for the first stage deployment with the CashBag 
Micropayments Ledger. 



CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  12

B

C

The advertiser sends a payment in CBC tokens or 
cash equivalent which is credited to an Advertiser 
escrow wallet (A) and converted to tokens. As the 
consumer shops online and earns the transaction 
fee, the flow of payments unlocks.

The advertiser remits payment through a smart 
contract (SC) which allocates the payment to the 
consumer from the advertiser wallet.  

The smart contract splits the payment, allocating 
part of the payment “the transaction fee” to 
CashBag (C1), and passing on the balance on to the 
Consumer (C2).

AEach consumer transaction will be verified by the 
advertiser utilizing our existing real-time transactional 
tracking solution which is integrated to our Advertisers. 
Our platform is established and currently tracking all our 
transactional revenue.

Additionally, we interface with 3rd party tracking solutions 
already deployed by Advertisers through our API interface, 
enabling advertisers to capture and approve transactions 
on the CashBag Ledger. 

Payment will be effected through smart contracts for 
Transactional & Advertising fees.

This flow shows the conceptual flow of the CBC payments 
using smart contracts.

WHY CONTRIBUTE?

CASHBAG TOKEN SALE - WHITEPAPER  |  15

Our token sale is an opportunity for early adopters to 
participate in a crowdsale of redeemable tokens with a 
guaranteed advertising redemption value.  

After the initial token issue is fully distributed no further 
tokens will be created and the company will buy back 
tokens to issue as incentive rewards to members.

CPC price will follow Hartwick’s Rule   where through 
our buyback program the tokens will maintain liquidity 

and increase in value over time as more users enter the 
ecosystem. Due to scarcity and the limited supply we 
anticipate that the unit price of CBC will rise as demand, 
driven by member earnings, increases the price.  

CashBag will pay it’s members incentives using an 
incentive ratio, currently 10:1 (one tenth dollar value 
equivalent in CBC to each dollar cash back earned). This 
incentive will be funded from profits and purchased on the 
open market.
