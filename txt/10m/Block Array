OVERVIEW 
Problem 

Barcodes don’t provide much information besides what company is associated with it and the product 
identification.  

Solution 

Create a protocol and infrastructure to enable consumers and businesses to be able to communicate with each 
other through the use of barcodes 

Products 

GS1 Barcodes anchored to the blockchain with ARY Tokens 
Software libraries  
Mobile Applications  
Visual SmartContracts 
Array.Network - Powered with ARY Tokens 

Goals 
Create a semi-centralized barcode system that offers both normal GS1 Barcodes along with unique anti-
counterfeit barcodes. In order to comply with existing laws and regulations (e.g. firearms, chemicals, biological 
agents, etc) necessitate a “party” to discern what products are not allowed to be anchored to the blockchain and 
tracked. Implement a protocol that can take blockchain transaction IDs and user permissions into EPCIS-style 
event data. 

Project Outline 

We will outline our Consumer, Enterprise, and Logistics mobile applications. Provide a brief overview of the ARY 
Token, the associated protocols that the token is for and various implementations of our protocols that use the 
ARY Token.  

• ARY Tokens are used to anchor new GS1 Barcodes to the Ethereum blockchain 
• ARY Tokens are used to validate software licensing for commercial use  
• ARY Tokens to be used for virtualized grey-pool for truck drivers 
• ARY Tokens to provide a “toll” for access to outputs of platform-specific protocols 



 

INTRODUCTION 
At the core of any traceability program is the requirement to identify and track individual products. BlockArray can 
revolutionize businesses’ supply chain operations product, shipment changes of custody, business processes, and 
traceability events. Block Array also can provide increased business intelligence and chain of custody logs via 
actionable analytics, demand forecasting and alerts. 

• Why does your project need to be on a blockchain? 
• Some countries restrict how data for sensitive products, such as weapons or chemical/biological/radioactive 

items can be stored on computers. Barcode data may be required to be hosted in the country and not on a 
global cloud system. See GS1 ONS 2.0.1 – Political Concerns 

• Are you creating your own blockchain?  
• We are using the Ethereum blockchain to “anchor” records by burning a token for creating a timestamp. A 

proof is a JSON-LD document, that contains the information to cryptographically verify a piece of data is 
anchored to a blockchain. It proves the data existed at time it was anchored. We also have our own 
chainpoint nodes for hashing additional information 



 

PROBLEMS 
Global operations need consistent global standards to be applied across their supply chain, 
and this is only going to become increasingly difficult with legacy enterprise systems and 
increased legal costs. Laws recently passed like The California Transparency Supply Chain Act 
or the Electronic Logging Data Mandate for Trucking add additional burdens to businesses 
trying to comply with the law, coupled with more demands on increasingly outdated IT systems 
- this then creates multiple problems for firms. Access to data required for different jurisdictions 
can be problematic, and barcodes provide an efficient and intuitive way to access that 
information. 

#1 Data Fragmentation 
From Suppliers, freight, retailers and vendors there is a lot of information available from disparate sources all 
concerning the same product 

#2 Contextual Problem 
Even if that data was available, the issue then becomes how can the consumer or relevant party access that data 
in an efficient and relevant manner? 

#3 Authoritative  
Information you find online might not be the correct information, you have to trust the results you are finding on 
google 

Being able to authenticate a product does not make sense if you don’t have a way 
consumers can easily find that information. The GS1 barcode is how we base everything 
off of. When you put the capability of a consumer to suddenly find out specifics, you might find 
out that they actually do care about where it came from, who handled it, what people have to 
say about it, etc. The business impact can also be seen in industries that still do faxing and 
physical storage of documents as well, such as healthcare. What good is it if you can 
authenticate a product if you don’t have an easy way to find out if it is authentic?

BDI - THE BLOCKCHAIN DATA INTERFACE PROTOCOL 

The Blockchain Data Interface is an electronic data interface protocol that allows communication between 
blockchains and existing software systems, such as ERM, ERPs, etc. The protocol uses a JSON schema to define 
queries, and can plug in existing RESTful APIs into the system to push requests. BDI is based off of the EDI 
specifications from GS1 along with some modifications. User activity tracking through a mobile device, such as a 
warehouse employee fulfilling orders and scanning a barcode for a specific order will be visually tracked through 
Emerge, our specific application within Visual SmartContracts. The Smart Contract pushes out to the user and the 
user is granted permission to complete it and pass it on to the next person (this is done automatically be user 
permissions already). This fulfillment process can be adapted to many industries and supply chain systems. 
Creating a blockchain protocol based on the ONS/EPCIS specification (eXtensible ONS, XONS) for the access and 
creation of barcode records (for the tracking and management for shipping and logistics) is a secondary objective. 
We can get out the gate using a Web based solution to interact with the blockchain, but down the line we fully 
plan on implementing the protocol specified as a free and open source project.Token holders will have the 
opportunity to host full nodes or partial nodes for the blockchain network. Block Array will have its own GS1 Prefix, 
allowing us to issue codes for those who wish to use our own prefix for their products. Token holders will be able 
to purchase ONS2.0.1 compliant barcodes using our prefix, and domain name service will be provided by us for 
such issuances. A proportion of the tokens used in the issuance of such barcodes will be burned, providing an 
anchor to the blockchain by means of the timestamp of the transaction.

XONS - EXTENSIBLE OBJECT NAME SERVICE  

In order to use DNS to find information about an item, the item’s GS1 Identification Key must be converted into a 
format that DNS can understand, which is the typical, “dot” delimited, left-to- right form of all domain names. As 
the purpose of ONS is to discover data and services associated with a GS1 Identification Key and multiple sets of 
data and services may exist for that key, the appropriate DNS record type is the Naming Authority PoinTeR 
(NAPTR) [RFC 3403]. This record type contains several fields for denoting the protocol, services, and features that 
a given service endpoint exposes. It also allows the service endpoint to be expressed as a URI, thus allowing 
complex services to be encoded in a standard way. The figure below describes a typical XONS query from start to 
finish from the viewpoint of a developer. In this example, the starting point is a bar code or RFID tag. However, the 
source of the GS1 IdentificationKey is not restricted to data carriers; it could be part of a transaction document 
(e.g. a purchase order), an event record, a master data record, or any other source.

GS1 BARCODES 
With a GS1 Barcode you will have access to large retailers, including Amazon FBA (fulfillment by amazon). It is an 
international standard that having access to allows your goods to be traded internationally. Buying a GS1 Barcode 
does not mean that these companies will sell your products, only that you can offer your goods at these retailers. 
This is only a few of the many retailers that mandate GS1 barcodes. https://www.gs1.org/

VISUAL SMARTCONTRACT FRAMEWORK 

Based on user permissions that are defined in our visual smart contracts platform we define a specific employees 
permissions. Their permissions are tied to a mobile device (smartphone, handheld terminal, etc). The actions they 
are allowed to do (such as moving an order onto a truck) are defined by their permissions. The events listed above 
in the table are the actions normally recorded on an EPCIS server: these events are now interpreted through 
Transaction IDs on the blockchain.

ARY GS1 PROTOCOL  
Description and Mechanics  

1) The small business registers the GS1 Barcode and products with us 
2) Upon receipt of information, we register the GS1 Barcode. 
3) The small business then must send us the tokens to a predetermined burn wallet address 
4) After completion of the GS1 registration, small business is given all the information (Barcode files, packaging 

placement, etc) 
5) We then burn the tokens from the wallet address, and the information associated with the burn like the 

Ethereum wallet address for the small business along with the GS1 Barcode information is included in the 
Transaction Field. 

6) GS1 Barcode is created and anchored to the Ethereum blockchain, 1 ARY Token is sent back to the Ethereum 
Wallet Address for the Small Business.

VISUAL SMARTCONTRACTS - USE CASE 
HOW INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS CAN HELP THE POINT OF CONTACT 
EMPLOYEE FOR COMPANIES USING VISUAL SMART CONTRACTS SYSTEM 
With Smart Contracts, standards can be applied, such as seeing how long an employee at a supplier works in a 
foreign country, or where the coffee beans were sourced through GPS tracking, seamlessly. The value of smart 
contracts exists in business logic: the ability to define user actions and permissions in a distributed and 
decentralized way. Visual SmartContracts follows the KANBAN methodology: Based on user permissions they are 
given access to orders as they progress through the system. You will be able to see work orders, purchase orders, 
etc in real time as they are processed through the system using barcode scans throughout the scans. We can see 
here how business logic can filter out what a point of contact person (in this example a customer support person) 
can be assisted through the use of business logic (smart contracts).

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 
 
In this paper we have outlined the major issues and current methodologies/technologies deployed in supply chain 
management. We can see that the system is hugely monolithic and requires a vast up-front cost to implement to 
truly have an adaptable global supply chain. Our approach to adapting these for use with a private & permission 
based distributed ledger system does not try and “re-invent” the wheel, but rather use existing terminology and 
design aspects to better adapt the system to current technology trends and allow easier integration among 
disparate systems. Ultimately we are not seeking to supplant any GS1 specifications or standards, but use them 
as they were intended to be used: as a global communication framework to allow companies to talk to each other. 

• How we can get normal barcodes to automatically point to a URL/URI 

• How we can use physical actions such as scanning a barcode to record transactions onto the blockchain  

• How we can provide that information in a similar fashion that supply chain companies are familiar with, but do 
not have access to necessarily, nor do they have the level of data or granularity that we can provide  

• Utilize new technology to improve QR codes to help fight counterfeiting 

• Create new product identification mechanisms to ensure product is authentic using current technology  

• How we can track assets without the use of RFID tags with only updated software  

• Create a virtualized “grey-pool” for businesses to have access to unused shipping capacity  

• How our token can actually be used for small businesses to gain access to larger customers  

• Lower the barrier of entry for new businesses in accessing existing marketplaces like Amazon 

• How our Protocol Anchors GS1 Barcode creation to the blockchain and points to that businesses associated 
Ethereum Wallet Address

crowd sale portion 

“VESTING” PERIOD 
Do not think that because we use the term “vesting” that his implies an equity ownership stake into Block Array 
LLC. We use the term out of convenience.   

Tokens held by us (Block Array LLC) will follow this scheme: 
9 month cliff - If employee leaves before 9 months, 0 tokens. 
4 year normal vesting afterwards. 
Right of First Refusal - Any tokens held by individuals associated with Block Array must be offered to us first 
before they can be sold to any individual or exchange or marketplace
