Abstract
Digital currency, represented by Bitcoin and 
Ethereum, is blazing through traditional 
financial systems with the force of a prairie 
fire. Although blockchain technology is still in 
the initial stages of development, its transpar-
ent mechanisms and open concepts show 
tremendous vitality. Wanchain seeks to link 
the present to the future, through the explora-
tion and implementation of blockchain tech-
nology.

Wanchain aims to build a distributed “bank”. 
Just as traditional banks are the infrastructure 
of the current financial framework, Wanchain 
seeks to build a new, distributed infrastruc-
ture of digital assets to form an improved, 
modern framework - an ambitious goal 
indeed.

Wanchain connects and exchanges value 
between different blockchain ledgers in a 
distributed manner. It uses the latest cryp-
tographic theories to build a non-proprietary 

cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger 
that records both cross-chain and intra-chain 
transactions. Any blockchain network, wheth-
er a public, private or consortium chain, can 
integrate with Wanchain to establish connec-
tions between different ledgers and perform 
low cost inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wan-
chain ledger supports not only smart 
contracts, but also token exchange privacy 
protection.

With Wanchain, any institution or individual 
can set up their own virtual teller window in 
the “bank” and provide services such as loan 
origination, asset exchanges, credit payments 
and transaction settlements based on digital 
assets. Under the guarantee of “banks” based 
on the blockchain infrastructure, more people 
can participate in financial services based on 
digital assets. To describe it more accurately, 
Wanchain is a distributed super-financial 
market based on blockchain.

1/  WANChain Design Concept

1.1/   Blockchain Emergence and Significance

Friedrich A. Hayek, the eminent Austrian econ-
omist, believes that if we let currencies com-
pete in the market by survival of the fittest, like 
other commodities, market mechanisms can 
filter out the most appropriate currency for us, 
just like it does for those other commodities. 

In January 2009, the first Bitcoin block was 
mined. The emergence of Bitcoin transcend-
ed Hayek’s ideal state where responsibility 
for controlling the total amount of money in a 
system is borne by specific institutions, 
whose self-interest keeps the total currency 
amount at a level acceptable to most users.

The switch from credit authorization by institu-
tions to inviolable mathematical laws for 
recording the exchange of value is another 
great innovation. In essence, currency is a 
consensus. It is an agreed upon accounting 
representation for a more convenient 
exchange of value. Reviewing mankind’s 
financial history, from the bartering of one 
thing for another, to the use of cattle, sheep or 
shells as universal equivalents, to the use of 
precious metals as money, and the current use 
of paper currency with a strong credit base, 
human currency is approaching abstract math-
ematics and its nature as symbols or ledgers is 
more apparent. Blockchains make human 
accounting symbols align closer to mathemat-
ics.It helps the entire accounting system get

away from control by a single institution and 
move in a more fair and transparent direction.

The concept of Financial Inclusion seeks to give 
disadvantaged people and small enterprises, 
worldwide, better access to the financial system 
and low-cost financial services. Two and a half 
billion people in the world are unable to use 
banks, open savings accounts or obtain credit 
cards and are therefore separated from the 
global economy. Cross-border remittances 
through banks incur high fees. Ordinary inves-
tors can only buy relatively low-end financial 
products from banks and other financial institu-
tions and can't take part in early-stage invest-
ments of technology companies such as Google 
and Alibaba before they are listed. It is also 
difficult for a large number of small to medium 
enterprises to obtain loan support from banks, 
in spite of good credit and outstanding perfor-
mance, because they are not the target custom-
ers of traditional banks under the 80/20 rule. 

Georg Hegel said “Reality is a historical process,” 
and the emergence of blockchain technology is 
changing the above situations. When Venezuela 
recently devalued its currency, Bitcoin became a 
popular safe-haven asset. Workers in foreign 
countries, such as the Philippines, remit their 
income to their weak hometown banking facili-
ties through blockchain networks. Investors who 
participated in the ICO of well-known blockchain

can be created and implemented and where 
the transaction privacy can be effectively 
protected. Of course, such "banks" will be com-
pletely different from traditional banks, except 
for some functions such as debit and credit, 
remittance, settlement, and sale of financial 
products.  With corresponding ability and capi-
tal strength, any organization or individual can 
set up their own business windows. They can 
provide various services, under the guarantee 
of a distributed blockchain infrastructure, to 
provide more financial services for more 
people. More accurately, this is a future finan-
cial infrastructure based on digital assets, and 
also a distributed financial market. 

1.2/   Design Background

projects, such as Ethereum, received returns 
hundreds of times the size of their initial invest-
ments. Blockchain technology is pushing Inclu-
sive Finance to brand new heights.

As of June 2017 there are thousands of digital 
currencies based on blockchain technology 
with a total market value of over $100 billion, 
and the number and value of digital curren-
cies continues to grow. Digital currency is 
becoming more acceptable as a form of 
payment in financial transactions; many 
organizations are exploring ways to record 
traditional forms of assets, such as commer-
cial bills and loyalty points, into blockchains, 
usually in the form of consortium chains.

Digital asset exchanges, which are similar to 
traditional financial institutions, have 
emerged. These exchanges perform the 
banking function of exchanging digital 
assets. They are a platform for buying and 
trading tokens, similar to those of a stock 
exchange. A platform for cross-border token 
transfers performs functions similar to 
cross-border bank remittances.

However, these platforms, in various degrees, 
are operating in a centralized manner, which 
not only brings about the security risks of 
centralization, but also blocks the wider adop-
tion of blockchain technology.

Based on this, we need a distributed "bank" 
where different digital currencies and digital 
assets can be transferred in, transferred out 
and exchanged by blockchains. A place 
where financial products and contracts 
based on digital currencies and digital assets 

In the early days of traditional banks, currency 
exchange was their main purpose, and func-
tions such as currency custody, payments, 
settlements and remittances were gradually 
developed. At last, modern banks with depos-
its and loans as their main business were 
born. It can be said that a bank is a ledger 
recording debtor-creditor relationships. Every 
receipt, payment and transfer of funds is, in 
fact, a change of corresponding assets in a 
bank ledger that supports more than one 
asset. An exchange settlement among differ-
ent banks is actually an asset record change 
on different ledgers. It must be ensured that 
the assets are not double spent, regardless of 
whether the asset changes are in the same 
ledger or in different ledgers. In general, the 
increase or decrease in the amount of an 

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 02



1.3/   Design Objectives 

asset in a ledger must correspond to an 
equivalent opposite change in another 
ledger. The block chain has a good solution to 
the problem of double spending in the same 
ledger in different accounts. Solving the prob-
lem of transferring assets among different 
blockchain ledgers is key to the wider appli-
cation of blockchain technology. Wanchain 
requires a distributed approach to support 
the access of different blockchains and the 
transfer of assets - that is, to support 
cross-chain transactions.

Effective protection of users’ privacy is one of 
the foundations of traditional banking. Any 
financial transaction is needed to be protect-
ed from a third party. Wanchain needs to have 
the same capabilities.

Wanchain is a distributed financial market. In 
principle, any organization or individual can 
develop and provide their own financial 
services based on Wanchain. It requires Wan-
chain, a blockchain infrastructure, to support 
the programmable smart contract function.

In summation, Wanchain is designed under 
such a context.

Cross-Chain Asset Transfer:
· Connect existing major digital currency 
networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and 
completing the asset exchanges without 
modifying the mechanism of original chains. 
This integrates newly generated digital 
currency networks with Wanchain at a very 
low cost.

· Integrate consortium chains with Wanchain. 
This fulfills the functions of transferring assets 
from original chains to Wanchain, transferring 
assets from Wanchain back to the original 
chains, and trading various assets on Wan-
chain.

· Ensure the security of cross-chain transac-
tions and the stability of cross-chain transac-
tion services.

Transaction Privacy Protection:
·  Allow trading parties to choose to conduct 
transactions with privacy protection.

· Provide privacy protection for transfers and 
exchanges of digital assets.

·  Provide anonymous protection of digital asset 
holders.

Functional Extensibility:
· Become a distributed platform for the 
exchange of various digital currencies.

· Carry out deposit and loan business for 
different digital currencies.

· Conduct transactions of digital assets using 
digital currency as a medium.

· Issue and trade brand new digital financial 
assets.

In order to build a more widely spread block-
chain technology and digital asset applications, 
Wanchain has set the following objectives 
based on the research on cross-chain technolo-
gy, combined with the characteristics of decen-
tralization and its application scenarios:

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 03

Architecture 
and Technolo-
gy

1.4/   Positioning

Wanchain provides an infrastructure for 
cross-chain transfers between different block-
chain networks.

Wanchain is a distributed ledger that:
· achieves the interconnection and interopera-
bility between different blockchain networks.

· completes records of cross-chain transactions.

· maintains cross-chain transaction details.

Wanchain supports cross-chain transactions 
between mainstream public chains, between 
private chains, and between public and 
private chains.

Through the establishment of links among 
different blockchains, the inter-ledger trans-
fer of assets can be achieved, providing an 
infrastructure for financial applications based 
on digital currencies and digital assets. We 
seek to give full play to the blockchain func-
tion of carrying and transferring value, and 
the equal and open concept of blockchain.

From a blockchain technology development 
perspective, Wanchain applies secure 
multi-party computation, threshold 
secret-sharing, a ring signature scheme 
based on elliptic curve cryptography, a 
one-time account generation mechanism, 
and many other cutting-edge cryptographic 
technologies. Wanchain also solves the priva-
cy protection problem of smart contract 
token transactions. To some extent, Wan-
chain is an advanced cryptographic applica-
tion that solves the real problems of block-
chains and represents the developmental 
direction of the blockchain technologies. 
Wanchain has a professional cryptography 
research team to apply cryptography to the  
blockchain field and contribute to the indus-
try as a whole.  

From a blockchain application perspective, 
Wanchain is more than just a blockchain proj-
ect of achieving cross-chain transactions and 
interoperability of multiple blockchains. 
Wanchain is a complete blockchain develop-
ment platform. Wanchain achieves the func-
tion of cross-chain transactions, but it is also
a blockchain running independently; it 

contains native coins, supports smart 
contracts, and has privacy protection mecha-
nisms for smart contract token transactions. 
Any developer may develop applications on 
Wanchain in accordance with its application 
development standards.

mechanisms for cross-chain transactions. 
These mechanisms are discussed in the 
following sections. 

2.1.4 Intra-Chain Transactions
Common transaction methods in Wanchain 
are the same as in Ethereum, but we have 
added a privacy protection mechanism that is 
implemented through a ring signature 
scheme and a one-time account mechanism.

2.1.5 Cross-Chain Connection
Both blockchains and assets that integrate with 
Wanchain first need to be registered on Wan-
chain to make sure that they can be uniquely 
identified. These functions are completed via 
chain and asset registration protocols. 

For cross-chain transactions, we use secure 
multi-party computing and threshold 
secret-sharing joint anchoring schemes to 
achieve minimal-cost integration through the 
cross-chain communication protocol without

2.1/  Architecture

2.1.1 Distributed Ledger and Smart Con-
tract Virtual Machine
Wanchain is an Ethereum-based generic 
ledger that runs applications independently, 
with account models and smart contracts 
that implement various original Ethereum 
functions.  On top of those, we added 
cross-chain transactions and achieved smart 
contract token privacy protection. 

2.1.2 Native Coin
Wancoin is the native coin of Wanchain. Both 
cross- and intra-chain transactions consume 
a certain amount of Wancoin. Wancoin is also 
used in security deposits for the cross-chain 
verification nodes.

2.1.3 Consensus Mechanism
Wanchain adopts a Proof of Stake (POS) 
consensus mechanism for ordinary transac-
tions and implements consensus and incentive 



changing the original chain’s implementa-
tion. Wanchain is a complete platform that 
can be applied to broad financial applica-
tions with privacy protection for smart 
contract token transactions of public and 
private chains. What’s more important is 
that other blockchains developed on Wan-
chain are equivalent to the homogeneous 
blockchains of Wanchain and have the same 
cross-chain mechanism and seamless inte-
gration with each other.

2.1.5 Cross-Chain Transactions
When an unregistered asset is transferred 
from the original chain to Wanchain, Wan-
chain will create a new asset using a built-in 
asset template to deploy a new smart 
contract based on the cross-chain transac-
tion information. When a registered asset is 
transferred from the original chain to Wan-
chain, Wanchain will issue the corresponding 
equivalent tokens in the existing contracts to

ensure that the original chain assets can still 
be traded on Wanchain.

In order to describe the transfer of assets 
between a public chain and Wanchain, we’ll 
illustrate an example using Ethereum:

Transfer-In Process: Alice and Bob have 
accounts on Ethereum and Wanchain respec-
tively, and Alice needs to transfer 10 ETH to Bob.

Alice makes a cross-chain transaction request 
using the Wanchain wallet and initiates a 
transfer on Ethereum, with the recipient being 
an Ethereum cross-chain Locked Account. 
Wanchain’s validator node receives the 
cross-chain transaction request, verifies that 
the transaction has been recorded on Ethere-
um, and creates a new smart contract token 
ETH′ (ether prime) on Wanchain, which corre-
sponds to the ETH needing to be cross-trans-
ferred to to Bob on Wanchain.

2.2/  Technology

2.2.1 Fully Decentralized and No Trust-
ed Third-Party Participation
Currently, most cross-chain transactions are 
conducted through exchanges and third-par-
ty trading platforms. But the blockchain 
cross-chain transaction platforms need the 
involvement of a third-party custodian 
account. This leaves the secure and smooth 
completion of the entire transaction to the 
reliability of third-party participants. The 
locked account mechanism of Wanchain

Transfer-Back Process: Bob wants to trans-
fer the 10 ETH he received from Alice to Chris.
 
Bob uses his Wanchain wallet to initiate a 
cross-chain transaction with the ETH′ asset 
contract. Upon receiving the request, the 
validator node locks the corresponding 10 
ETH′ assets. After successfully locking the 
assets, the validator node uses the threshold 
secret-sharing mechanism to create an

Ethereum transaction with the transferor 
being the Locked Account that was previ-
ously locked by Alice’s assets and the trans-
feree being Chris’s account on Ethereum.  
After the validator node verifies the 
confirmed transaction on Ethereum, the 10 
ETH′ locked under Bob’s account will be 
cleared, meaning the equivalent asset is 
transferred back to the original chain.

The above describes the asset transfer-in and 
transfer-back processes between Wanchain 
and the public chain, which is essentially the 
same as that between Wanchain and the 
private chain. For details of the asset transfer 
process and data transmission process, 
please refer to Section 3.2 Cross-Chain 
Transaction Data Transmission Process.

curve cryptography to ensure the security of 
the original signature solution, Wanchain uses:

· threshold secret-sharing technology,

· the locked account management solution 
based on multi-party computing,

· the privacy protection mechanism for smart 
contract token transactions, based on ring 
signatures and one-time accounts.

All subsequent operations are automatically 
done between validator nodes of Wanchain 
and don’t need coordination from transac-
tion participants after initiating an cross-chain 
transaction. This leaves the smooth operation 
of the entire system to the security of cryp-
tographic algorithms.  

2.2.4 Cross-Chain Transaction Privacy 
Protection
In Wanchain’s cross-chain transaction solu-
tion, assets on the original chain exist in the 
form of smart contract tokens after they are 
transferred into Wanchain. On one hand, we 
hide the initiators of smart contract token 
transactions in a collection of accounts, via 
ring signature technology, so that they are not 
traceable. On the other hand, we allow 
one-time use of accounts in smart contracts, 
so the corresponding relationship with the 
original account on Wanchain cannot be 
established. By using a combination of the 
above two methods, Wanchain achieves the 
confidentiality of smart contract token trans-
actions, allows cross-chain transactions of 
assets under privacy protection, expands 
application scenarios and provides a better 
user experience.

uses fully decentralized, multi-party comput-
ing and threshold secret-sharing technology 
to perform the account management without 
the need of any third-party participation or 
credit endorsement of any entities.

2.2.2 Unmodified Original Chain and 
Low Integration Threshold
In our cross-chain transaction solution, the 
account locking mechanism doesn’t use 
two-way anchoring, and doesn’t need addi-
tional script extensions to identify and verify 
the Simple Payment Verification (SPV) proof. All 
transaction data is transmitted into the node 
network of the original chain after reconstruc-
tion and integration on the Wanchain validator 
node. The format of the validator node is in line 
with the transaction type requirements. This 
enables certain operations and computations 
of cross-chain transactions to be completed 
within the Wanchain network, without the 
need to modify the various original chain 
mechanisms. This allows existing public and 
private chains, based on other platforms, to be 
integrated with Wanchain with a low integra-
tion threshold, thus reducing the cost of 
cross-chain transactions.

2.2.3 Cryptography Based Security 
Guarantee
Mechanisms used by many existing 
cross-chain exchanges often use logical secu-
rity, relying on participants to look out for 
their own self-interest. In other words, the 
participants will not break the cross-chain 
transactions at the expense of damaging their 
own interests. This can be called “The 
Hypothesis of Rational Participants”.

  In addition to the application of original elliptic

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 08



The Wanchain cross-chain communication 
protocol defines the specifications for data 
transmission between Wanchain and other 
chains, allowing interconnections and data flow 
between chains. The following paragraphs 
describe the module functions and data trans-
mission processes.

3.1/  Functional Modules

The cross-chain communication protocol consists of 
three functional modules:

Registration module: this module provides two 
functions.

The first is to register the original chain partici-
pating in cross-chain transactions.  This gener-
ates a unique ID through specific algorithm 
rules for the original chain, maintaining the ID 
registry of the original chains to avoid fraud 
caused by false chains.
 
The second function is to register the asset to be 
transferred. This generates a unique ID through 
specific algorithm rules for the asset to ensure 
the uniqueness of the assets.

Cross-chain Transaction Data Transmission 
Module: this module provides three functions. 

The first function is that the user on the origi-
nal chain makes the cross-chain transaction 
request to Wanchain. This is the starting point 
of the Wanchain asset transfer-in transaction.

The second function is the acknowledge-
ment of receipt of Wanchain’s validator node 
returning success or not.

The third function is that Wanchain’s valida-
tor node sends the legal transaction to the 
original chain to complete the transfer-back 
process.

Transaction Status Query Module: this 
module mainly provides the function of que-
rying the confirmation status of the asset 
transfer-in transaction on the original chain 
to Wanchain’s locked account and the trans-
fer-back transaction of Wanchain’s locked 
account to the original chain. These are the 
control marks of the cross-chain transaction 
progress.

3.2/ Data Transmission 
Process

Here we take the user Alice, who wants to 
transfer value from an original (Ori) chain to 
Wanchain, as an example to illustrate the 
asset transfer-in data transmission process:

3/  Cross-Chain Communi-
cation Protocol

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 09



WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 10

Step1：  Alice initiates a transaction OriTx with her OriAccount on the original chain to send an 
asset OriAssetID to Wanchain’s locked account LockedAccount and broadcasts the cross-chain 
transaction request InterTxReq to Wanchain via the cross-chain transaction data transmission 
module. 

The function takes the transaction data as parameters, such that:

OriTxInfo=(OriBlockNum,OriTx)
InterTxReq=(OriAccount,OriChainID,OriAssetID,value,OriTxInfo,sig)

Step2： ：The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) on Wanchain receives a cross-chain 
transaction request and checks whether the transaction has been confirmed on the original chain 
through the transaction status query module. 

The function Token Locked Flag (TLF) takes OriTxInfo, OriChainID and OriAssetID as parameters, 
such that:

TLF=CheckCommitment(OriChainID,OriAssetID,OriTxInfo)

Step3：   The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) gathers consensus on the TLF results 
and if TLF=true, then OriTx has been confirmed. The verification node (Validator) receives the data 
TLF=true, and then checks the asset registry of the original chain. If it is a new asset, the asset will 
be registered and added into the registry. The public account WANAccount, maintained by the 
Validator initiates a transaction WANTx, deploys a smart contract for the new asset and distributes 
tokens of Value for OriAccount in the contract. If it is a registered asset, the transaction WANTx 
distributes tokens of Value for OriAccount directly into the existing asset contract. If WANTx is 
confirmed, the Validator uses the cross-chain transaction data transmission module to reply to 
Alice about the successful receipt of the cross-chain transaction: 

response=(WANAccount,InterTxReq,True,addressSC,sigvalidator)

If WANTx becomes invalid, the locked account management node (Storeman) initiates a transac-
tion on the original chain to transfer Alice’s locked asset back to her account OriAccount.

If the consensus result for TLF is confirmed by the Voucher as false, the cross-chain transaction is 
considered invalid.



WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 11

In the next example, we have user Bob transferring Value from Wanchain back to the original 
chain to illustrate the asset transfer-back data transmission process:

Step1：  Bob uses BobAccount on Wanchain to send the transaction WANTx , which calls the asset 
transfer-back function of the smart contract corresponding to the asset of the original chain.

Step2：   The Validator calls the smart contract after receiving the transaction. The Voucher tests 
the results of the contract execution and gathers consensus. If TLF=true, which means that the 
token value for Bob in the contract has been locked, the Storeman then broadcasts the transac-
tion of Locked Account, which transfers Value to BobAccount on the original chain, via the 
cross-chain transaction data transmission module:

OriTx=(LockedAccount,BobAccount,value,sigstoreman)

The Voucher checks whether this transfer is confirmed via the transaction status query module, 
and gathers consensus on confirmation flag TL F.

Step3：  If the Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) = true, the Validator will clear the assets locked in the 
smart contract; if TUF=false, it means that transaction on the original chain is not confirmed and 
the Storeman will re-initiate the transaction.

is subject to the threat of 51% power attack, 
while similarly, the POS consensus algorithm 
is theoretically subject to a threat of collusion 
attack of participants. As a result, Wanchain 
introduces the this mechanism to increase 
the opportunity cost of verification node 
collusion, allowing Wanchain to record 
cross-chain transactions faithfully and follow 
the cross-chain processes objectively.

Wanchain adopts the Proof of Stake (POS) 
consensus algorithm, the description of which

um, so it is not detailed here. Theoretically, the

4.2.1 Verification Nodes
The Vouchers receive transaction fees from 
the corresponding shares as a security depos-
it. If the proof provided is found to be false, 
the security deposit is  deducted from the 
holding account and the node authority 
status will be revoked.  

In short, the verification nodes on Wanchain 
are divided into three categories:

·Cross-chain transaction proof nodes (Vouch-
ers)
·  Locked account management nodes (Store-
men)
· General verification nodes (Validators) 

Vouchers are used to provide proof of transac-
tions between the original account and the 
locked account. A Voucher is required to pay a 
certain security deposit. The higher the 
deposit, the greater chance the proof if 
provides will be adopted. If the proof is found 
to be false, the security deposit will be 
deducted from the holding account and the 
authorization of the Voucher is revoked.

The Storeman, upon receiving a notice, is 
responsible for computing the signature 
shares according to its own part of the key and 
merging the signatures parts into a complete 
signature for the lock account. When this is 
done, operations related to the locked 
account are performed (see the specific 
process in section 4.3). 

The Validator informs the Storeman of opera-
tional actions related to the locked account 
and complete the record of operations on the 
Wanchain whenever a transaction proof 
reaches a consensus.

The security of the Wanchain network 
depends on its overall value. When the value 
of all cross-chain transactions is far greater 
than the overall value of the Wanchain 
 

network, i.e. where the gains for collusion are 
greater than the opportunity cost, the risk of 
collusion between verification nodes will 
increase. 

On the contrary, when the overall value of the 
Wanchain is sufficiently high, collusion 
between verification nodes means giving up 
margin held by them that are staked to the 
tokens on Wanchain, greatly increasing the 
opportunity cost of collusion. The nodes will 
not collude to destroy the entire network for 
cross-chain asset risking their existing inter-
ests and long-term income, thus reducing 
the risk of collusion. 

Furthermore, the more cross-chain transac-
tions are involved in the Wanchain, the great-
er the value carried by Wanchain. The higher 
the risk for verification nodes to collude, the 
more secure the entire network, which will 
attract more and more cross-chain transac-
tions. This is an interactive process, with the 
value transferring to the Wanchain network.  
Wanchain is bound to become increasingly 
robust.



Such an incentive mechanism ensures that 
stakeholders in Wanchain can earn stake-re-
lated benefits while also motivating them to 
entrust their stakes to trusted verification 
nodes.  This improves the security and stabili-
ty of Wanchain.

The Locked Account Generation Scheme is 
based on secure multi-party computation 
and threshold key sharing.

A Validator completes the recording of transac-
tions on Wanchain to gain a part of the transac-
tion fees. 

A Storeman receives a corresponding key 
share according to the stake it holds, and 
calculates the corresponding signature share 
to be added into the transaction.  The Store-
man obtains the transaction fee involved in the 
verification transaction according to the key 
share proportion. If the key share information 
is offline or lost, the transaction fee can not be 
claimed. Likewise, if the nodes sign the error 
transaction, the credentials of the Storeman 
will also be taken away. 

In summary, the verification node incentive 
mechanism will motivate the Vouchers to 
provide correct transaction proof, the Valida-
tors to complete the recording of Wanchain 
faithfully, and the Storemen to stay online and 
safely keep their own key shares.  

4.2.2 General Nodes
Only those holding a high enough stake in the 
Wanchain network can become a verification 
node.  Nodes that fail to be verification nodes 
are known as general nodes. The general 
nodes cannot participate in the verification 
process of cross-chain transactions, but they 
can entrust the stakes they hold to the trusted 
verification nodes. The entrusted verification 
nodes distribute the transaction fees they 
receive to the general nodes in proportion to 
the entrusted stakes. If the entrusted verifica-
tion node is punished, general nodes will bear 
a corresponding loss. 

4.3.1 Introduction
Secure multi-party computation is both the 
theoretical basis of distributed cryptography 
and a fundamental problem of distributed 
computing. The theory arises from “Yao’s 
Millionaires’ Problem” in 1982. Simply speak-
ing, secure multi-party computation is about 
a group of participants, referred as P1��Pn, 
who work together to compute the function 
f(x1,��,xn )=(y1,��,yn) securely. The n 
inputs of function f are held, one each, by n 
participants. Pi holds the secret input xi, and 
after computation Pi gets output yi. In this 
situation, security requires that even if some 
participants cheat in the computing process, 
the correctness of the computing result must 
be ensured. This means that when computa-
tions are completed, every participant must 
get the correct output yi and all  input from 
participants remain privileged. Pi can get no

eration Scheme



extra information except (xi,yi) through the 
computation.

The threshold key sharing scheme is designed 
to solve the secure key management prob-
lem. According to design principles of modern 
cryptography, the security of cryptography 
depends on the security of the keys. Compro-
mised secure keys will ruin the security of 
cryptography. So key management is of great 
importance in security research and design of 
cryptography. In a situation when an account 
is managed by multiple parties with different 
interests, securely  managing the distribution 
of the keys can be difficult. To solve this prob-
lem, Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir 
proposed the Shamir’s Secret Sharing 
threshold key sharing scheme. 

In this scheme, a key is divided into n pieces 
and distributed to n participants. Every partic-
ipant holds one piece of the key share,  a 

minimum collection of k key shares are 
needed to reconstruct the key. Thus, any 
operation on an account will require at least 
k participants’ participation to ensure the 
account is secure and trustworthy.

4.3.2 Design Description
We designed the Locked Account Generation 
Scheme based on secure multi-party compu-
tation and threshold key sharing. Validators 
of Wanchain (Storemen) are in charge of 
maintenance and management of the keys 
of the Locked Accounts to ensure they are 
secure and trustworthy. In addition, this 
mechanism lowers the risk of losing keys and 
has strong adaptability and stability in an 
ad-hoc network, which has no fixed topolo-
gy. 

The Locked Account Generation Scheme is 
as follows: 

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 15

Step1：  Select a secure random number.
There are n validators on Wanchain, named as P₁……Pn. Each validator selects a secure random 
number di and k-degree polynomial fi (x)=di+ai,1 x+⋯+ai,k-1x       . The scheme sends fi ( j)to other 
validators through secure channel and broadcasts di G to every node of the network, G being the 
base point of the elliptic curve. 

Step2：  Check the correctness of the messages.
After receiving other validators’ messages, Pj will check the correctness of the messages: 

�lag=Check(f₁ (j),……,fn (j))

If flag=true, then Pj  accepts and saves it locally.

k-1



If flag=false, then Pj  rejects it and requires other validators to resend the messages.

Step3:   Receive key share.
When all messages are sent and checked out, then every validator gets their key share:   

key_sharek=∑(j=1) fj (k) ，k=1,……,n

Step4:   Compute the address of the Locked Account.

Locked_Account_Address=GenerateAddress(d₁ G,……,dn G)

After all the operations above, the Locked Account is generated, its key is divided into n key 
shares and then distributed to n validators of Wanchain. 

Any operation on the Locked Account will require at least k of n validators’ participation to 
complete.

4.3.3 Scheme Generation
During the generation process of the Locked Account, the private key is never generated or recon-
structed in the entire network. Generating the signature of the Locked Account needs at least k 
validators’ participation. They compute the signature shares separately through the key shares 
they hold, and then reconstruct the full signature using signature shares. 

The Locked Account Signature Scheme is as follows:

Step1：  Compute the Signature Shares
A quantity of n Wanchain Validators compute signature shares of the message using key shares 
they hold: 
  

signature_sharej=Generate_Sig(m,key_sharej)

Step2：  Send out the signatures shares.
Each Validator sends its signature share to other Validators.

Step3： Reconstruct and broadcast the complete signature.
When a Validator receives more than k signature shares, it will reconstruct the full signature and 
broadcast it to other Validators: 

signature=Construct_Sig(signature_share₁,……,signature_sharek)

Step 4: The full signature of Locked Account is generated

4.4/  Smart Contract Token 
Transaction Anonymity

On Wanchain, ring-signature and one-time 
accounts are implemented to achieve ano-
nymity in smart contract token transactions. 
Ring-signature mixes the transaction sender 
in a set of fake members to make the sender 
untraceable. A one-time account is generated 
for each transaction, so it can not be linked to 
the true owner.

the whole system operates with stability and  
security even in unforeseen circumstance 
where some part of network paralyzes or lose 
some key shares. At the same time, the key 
share of every validator is updated periodical-
ly or when a triggering condition is met, in 
order to eliminate the threat caused by key 
share exposure.

· Easy Integration and Efficient Data Stor-
age
Any operation on the Locked Account is done 
by the original transaction of the original 
chain. No new transaction type or verification 
mechanism is added. So theoretically, any 
chain can be integrated with Wanchain, and 
the cost is negligible. At the same time, com-
pared to the multi-signature account scheme 
that relies on the logic of smart contracts to 
achieve multiparty management, the Locked 
Account generation scheme achieves multi-
party management through principles of cryp-
tography. The final transaction has only one 
signature, not several signatures. Thus this 
mechanism is more efficient on data storage. 

4.3.4 Advantages 
Almost all cross-chain transaction schemes 
need a mechanism to lock the assets of the 
original chain. Only when the triggering 
condition is met will the locked assets be 
unlocked and returned to the original 
account or some other account. 

Existing mechanisms use the Hashed 
TimeLock Contract scheme, the Trusted 
Third-Party Escrow Account scheme and the 
Multi Signature Account scheme. 

Compared to these mechanisms, the Locked 
Account scheme has several advantages: 

·  Fully Decentralized without Third-Par-
ty Participation
The Locked Account is generated through 
secure multi-party computation. In this process, 
no participation or endorsement of a trusted 
third-party is needed. All we need is information 
interaction and computation by Validators 
through secure channels. Compared to the 
trusted third-party escrow account scheme, the 
Locked Account generation scheme has a lower 
cost and more flexibility.

·  Secure and stable
The key for the Locked Account is distributed 
to validators of Wanchain through Shamir’s 
Secret Sharing Scheme (a.k.a  Shamir’s (k, 
n)-threshold secret sharing scheme). Each 
Validator holds one piece of the key share. 
Even when some Validators are offline or lose 
their key shares, the signature of the Locked 
Account can still be generated and the trans-
action can be executed with the participation
 of  at least k validators. Therefore, the Locked 
Account generation scheme can ensure that

(A₁,S₁ )=OTA_GenerateAccount((A,B))

Alice invokes the function OTA_ScanAccount( ) with her own scan key to scan every sub-account 
(Ai,Si):

�lag=OTA_ScanAccount((Ai,Si ),(A,b))

When it comes to (A₁,S₁), the flag returns true. So (A₁,S₁) belongs to Alice. She invokes the function 
OTA_GetPrivateKey( ) with her main private key to get the private key of (A₁,S₁):

sk=OTA_GetPrivateKey((A₁,S₁ ),(a,b))

 In the One-time account system, the scankey helps Alice learn which sub-account belongs to her 
and the main private key guarantees that she is the only one who can get the private key. No one 
could change the owner of a sub-account without the associated scan key and get the private key 
without main private key. Therefore, anonymity and security is guaranteed.

4.4.1 One-Time Account System
As a foundation for anonymity, the one-time 
account system is especially important. Each 
user has only one main account and lots of 
sub-accounts. So if anyone wants to keep 
anonymous in a smart contract token trans-
action, he needs to generate an associated 
account to create an one-time main account 
together with his original one. 

On Wanchain, Alice has an original account 
(A,a). A is the public key and a is the private

 key. In order to create an one-time main 
account, she generate a new account (B,b).  
The main account is ((A,B),(a,b)) with main 
public key (A,B), main private key (a,b) and 
scan key (A,b). Usually a sub-account is 
generated by a transaction sender for the 
receiver. For example, Bob wants to send 
some tokens to Alice. He invokes the function 
OTA_GenerateAccount( ) with Alice`s main 
account as a parameter to generate Alice`s 
sub-account (A1,S1):

4.4.2 Ring Signature Scheme
The Ring Signature scheme was first provided in 2001 by Rivest and others. It is a special kind of 
Group Signature scheme. A Group Signature scheme needs a trusted center and secure setup, 
which would mean that the signer can be traced by the trust center. The Ring Signature scheme 
solves this serious problem by removing the trusted center and secure setup. 

Since the Ring Signature scheme was introduced, many practical schemes have been designed 
based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), such as the  trapdoor technique. Generally speak-
ing, there are four kinds of Ring Signature schemes: Trapdoor Ring Signature, Linkable Ring Signa-
ture, Anonymity Revocable Ring Signature, and Deniable Ring Signature.

In order to provide anonymity in Smart Contract Token transactions, the Ring Signature scheme 
based on ECC is implemented in Wanchain.

There are three parts to the Ring Signature scheme. Details are as below, taking the signer (P,x) as 
an example:

Figure 4.3: One Time Account System

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 20



GEN： Get the public parameters. The signer generates a public key set including n members from 
the world state through the function GeneratePublicKeySet( ) with the public key as a parameter:

publickeyset=GeneratePublicKeySet(P)

The signer makes a key image I by invoking GenerateKeyImage( ) with the public key and private 
key:

I=GenerateKeyImage((P,x))

SIG： Generate the ring signature. The signer generates the ring signature of message m through 
GenerateRingSignature( ) with publickeyset, I and x:

ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,x)

VER： Verify the ring signature. The signer verifies the ring signature of message m through 
VerifyRingSignature( ) which returns true or false with publickeyset, I and ringsig:

�lag=VerifyRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,ringsig)

If the flag is true, the ring signature is valid. Otherwise it`s invalid.

In the Ring Signature scheme, the key image and ring signature can not be matched with the signer 
who is among the publickeyset. Anyone can verify whether the signature is valid or not, but no one 
is able to identify the signer.

4.4.3 Privacy Protection Transaction Flow
Alice wants to send some tokens to Carl in the smart contract whose address is SCAddress. Alice`s 
main account is (A,B) with main private key (a,b). Carl`s main account is (C,D) with the main 
private key (c,d). Alice has a sub-account Onetime_account1 with the private key sk1 in the smart 
contract. The transaction flow is as follows:

Alice sends a transaction:
Step1：  Alice generates an one-time account for Carl with his main account:

Onetime_account2=OTA_GenerateAccount((C,D)) 

Step2：  Alice generates the signature for the transaction data in the smart contract through Gen-
erateSignature( ) with sk1 and makes the final data Payload:

sig=GenerateSignature(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce)
Payload=(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce,sig)

Step3：  Alice generates the public key set:

publickeyset＝GeneratePublicKeySet(A)

Step4：  Alice generates the key image and makes the transaction message m:

I=GenerateKeyImage((A,a))
m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)

Step5：  Alice generates the ring signature and makes the final transaction data:

ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,a)
transaction=(publickeyset,SCAddress,Payload,I,ringsig)

Step6：  Alice broadcasts transaction on the Wanchain.

The Validator verifies a transaction:
Step1：  The Validator receives transaction and makes the transaction data m to verify the ring 
signature:

m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)
�lag=VerifyRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,ringsig)



5.1/  Borrowing and Lending increase.Take Ethereum (ETH) for example. A 
service provider uses a smart contract to 
create a deposit application and set the inter-
est rate on Wanchain. A user transfers ETH 
from the Ethereum blockchain to the corre-
sponding Wanchain smart contract address 
through a cross-chain transaction. The 
deposit on Wanchain releases a correspond-
ing voucher (tokens on Wanchain that are 
similar to deposit bank receipts) to the user’s 
account on Wanchain. The smart contract 
then automatically calculates the interest. 
When the user needs to withdraw the depos-
it, the voucher will be transferred back to an 
intermediary address, and a cross-chain 
transaction is executed. The ETH corre-
sponding to the voucher is unlocked  on the
 

As digital currency becomes an important 
medium of value exchange and a value stor-
age carrier, using it to create new value and 
generate income is an inevitable trend. For 
example, Bitcoin is used to invest in block-
chain mining businesses and other ICO proj-
ects. With the increasing number of applica-
tions for digital currency, direct investment 
opportunities for digital currency have 
increased. 

People who use digital currencies to create 
value need more digital currencies, and 
people who hold digital currencies want to 
increase their value, so the demand for 
borrowing and lending digital currencies  will

Step2：  If flag is true, the Validator goes to step 3. Otherwise the transaction is invalid and thrown 
out.

Step3：  The Validator invokes the smart contract with Payload as a parameter. Then the smart 
contract verifies the signature in Payload and executes the transfer.

After step 3, the transaction is committed on Wanchain. Carl scans the sub-accounts with his scan-
key and recognizes that Onetime_account2 belongs to himself. Then he gets the private key for 
Onetime_account2 with his main private key. Therefore he takes the tokens of Value.



5.2/  Payment and Settle-
ment

5.3/  Transaction and Ex-
change

5.4/   Investment and 
Financing

More and more businesses accept digital 
assets, like Bitcoin, as a means of payment. In 
the future, there will be more applications in 
which a variety of digital currencies are used 
for payments. Currently, there are many 
payment methods such as VISA, Paypal and 
Alipay, each with their own payment proce-
dures and settlement processes. Wanchain is 
a distributed multi-currency platform, inte-
grating different banking ledgers into one 
unified ledger. Any business or user can 
install the Wanchain wallet to implement 
multi-currency payments and settlements 
without having to install multiple digital 
currency wallets.

original chain and transferred back to the 
original user’s account. The deposit reserves 
(the locked assets on the original chain corre-
sponding to the intermediary address) are 
always transparent.

At present, the completion of digital currency 
exchange depends on centralized exchanges 
and over-the-counter markets. All transac-
tions are based on trust of the exchanges and 
intermediaries. After multiple currencies are 
integrated with Wanchain, the exchanges or 

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 24

intermediaries can achieve multi-currency 
auction trading and one-to-one curb transac-
tions via smart contracts. The privacy protec-
tion transaction mechanism on Wanchain 
provides support for transactions that require 
privacy protection. Wanchain allows for 
importing digital currency into Wanchain, 
launching private transactions on Wanchain 
and transferring digital currency back to the 
original chain. To some extent, the privacy 
protection of the original chain is achieved by 
masking the fund tracking paths. 

There is a trend toward traditional institutions 
to use consortium chains to hold assets such 
as commercial bills, loyalty points, future 
earning rights, accounts receivable and so on. 
In the future, more financial assets will be 
recorded on distributed ledgers based on 
consortium chains. When these consortium 
chains are linked to Wanchain, they become 
financial asset providers, and the investors 
can use their digital currencies to buy these 
assets. As in the traditional banking business, 
it's akin to buying financial products in a 
bank. The difference is that more intermediar-
ies can participate and that the asset holders 
can carry out financing directly.

An ICO has become an important means of 
financing in the blockchain space, and this 
trend is spreading into non-blockchain areas. 
More and more projects, especially the ones

5.5/   Other Applications

based on Ethereum, directly use smart 
contracts for ICO, which makes the whole 
process more transparent and fair. But ICOs 
that only use Ether cause inconvenience to 
investors holding other digital currencies. On 
Wanchain, the ICO issuer can issue a smart 
contract that supports multi-currency invest-
ments. More conveniently, investors can 
invest by using Ethereum, Bitcoin or any 
other blockchain tokens integrated with 
Wanchain, and issuers can more easily 
manage their funds. Furthermore, when a 
new blockchain is launched, the conversion 
between the crowdfunded shares and the 
native currency can be completed via the 
Wanchain cross-chain transactions. With 
Wanchain, we are entering an era of digital 
right issuance fully based on blockchain.

The financial applications described above 
are intended to give readers a better under-
standing of the logic and value of Wanchain. 
From these, we can come up with more 
examples such as: multi-currency credit 
cards based on digital currency, asset backed 
securities that package up a variety of assets, 
Peer-to-Peer lending businesses based on 
digital currencies, crowdfunding, and so on.

Application of blockchain technology has 
been regarded as an important strategy  by 
major banks, but mostly they use of block-
chain technology to transform the traditional 
business. In the field of digital currency, 

banking business, like currency exchange, has 
been booming. Blockchains progress in these 
fields on two parallel tracks, but with the rise 
of digital assets and their increasing integra-
tion into the real economy, these two tracks 
will eventually intersect. Digital assets will be 
included in the banks' balance sheets (banks 
that support the loan and deposit of digital 
assets) and the banks' balance sheets will be 
partially transferred to blockchains (fiat 
money is represented and accounted by 
blockchain tokens). Wanchain’s inter-ledger 
technologies will support this future integra-
tion.



Conclusion
In this paper, we put forth the concept of a 
future “bank”. The term “bank” is an analogy 
used to give readers a more intuitive under-
standing of the concept. Abstracting block-
chain technology, from the concept of Bitcoin 
into a neutral technology, greatly improved 
the global popularization and application of 
blockchain, however it still faces huge obsta-
cles. It’s risky and expensive for traditional 
banks to solve existing business problems by 
using blockchains. Decision makers are 
unlikely and unwilling to take such a big risk 
due to investor return expectations, and for 
just one bank to change is not enough.

The financial framework based on digital 
currency, is similar to traditional banking at the 
business level but is different in nature and 
organization. Just as ecommerce did not 
sprout from traditional industries, but generat-
ed new commercial modalities that changed

 the traditional industries. As the proportion of 
digital currency in the economy increases, 
new financial industries based digital currency 
will flourish. Of course, given time, traditional 
banks will join the digital currency economy in 
their own ways and a financial ecosystem inte-
grating traditional assets with digital assets 
will gradually be developed.

Wanchain aims to design a new decentralized 
financial infrastructure, that allows the 
exchange of value among different blockchain 
networks. Based on this new model, interme-
diaries will develop their own financial 
services and build a distributed super finan-
cial market via Wanchain. We believe that a 
flexible, decentralized, value exchange system 
is the future of the financial infrastructure, and 
will help to promote financial inclusion and 
standardize future financial transactions.

Appendix: Glossary of Terms

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 28

Chain ID: The chain identifier in Wanchain’s registry. OriChainID is used to mark the original chain 
in transactions.
  
Cross-Chain Transaction: An asset transfer between two different blockchains (which means 
transfer-in or -out of the original chain.) When an asset on one chain is transferred to another 
chain, the total amount of the assets in the two ledgers stays unchanged, which will not cause any 
inflation or deflation. 

Homogeneous Chain: Either a public or  private chain developed based on Wanchain, which 
contains the same cross-chain protocol and asset cross-chain mapping methods, and can be inte-
grated with Wanchain seamlessly for two-way asset transfers. 

Inclusive Finance: Providing affordable financial services to disadvantaged and low-income 
segments of society.

ICO(Initial Coin Offering): An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding the release of a new 
cryptocurrency. Generally, tokens for the new cryptocurrency are sold to raise money for technical 
development before the cryptocurrency is released. Unlike an initial public offering (IPO), acquisition of 
the tokens does not grant ownership in the company developing the new cryptocurrency. 

Locked Account: The account to lock the assets transferred out of the chain.

Mapping Token (MT): The tokens on Wanchain corresponding to the original assets.

OriAccount: The account for the original chain that initiated the cross-chain transactions. For 
example, the OriAccount of Alice is written as OriAccount(Alice).

Private Chain: A blockchain network with limited openness and decentralization compared with a 
public chain, where authorization under specific rules is required for a new node to join the network.
  
Public Chain: A blockchain network fully open and decentralized, where any participants can join 
the network as long as they follow the protocol of the public chain.



WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 29

Storeman: A Wanchain node that holds the key shares of locked accounts, uses the key shares to 
generate signature shares and combine them into complete signatures, and carries out other oper-
ations on locked accounts.

Token Locked Flag (TLF): During the process of asset locking, Wanchain nodes verify the transac-
tion OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TLF consensus results to other nodes.

Token Unlocked Flag (TUF): During the process of asset unlocking, Wanchain nodes verify the 
transaction OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TUF consensus results to other nodes.

Validator: The blockchain node used in packaging and verifying the transactions. Wanchain’s verifica-
tion nodes are divided into three categories: the general verification nodes (Validators), the cross-chain 
transaction proof nodes (Vouchers), and the locked account management nodes (Storemen).

Voucher: A Wanchain verification node that is responsible for verifying whether the assets on the 
original chain are locked or unlocked for cross-chain transactions.

WAN Account: An account maintained by Wanchain’s Validators to initiate transactions on Wan-
chain and deploy or call smart contracts.

Wanchain: A public blockchain referred to in this white paper, including distributed ledger, smart 
contract, cross-chain protocol and other contents, which can achieve the cross-chain transactions, 
privacy protection for token transactions and other functions.

Wanchain Cross-Chain Protocol: The communication specifications for Wanchain cross-chain 
transactions (WIP for short), which includes Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Requests (WITx-
Req), Token Locked Flag (TLF), Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) and Mapping Token (MT):

Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Request (WITxReq): A package of information, which 
includes two parts - the Cross-Chain Transaction Request (InterTxReq) and the Origin Chain Trans-
action (OriTx). If the original chain is “BTC”, then it will be written as OriTx(BTC). If the original 
chain is the Wanchain, then it will be written as OriTx(WAN). For the public chain, OriTx is struc-
tured as the public chain transaction data format,  and the wallet uses OriTx to initiate the asset 
transfer to Wanchain’s locked account on the original chain. Wanchain and the homogeneous 
chain can construct a transaction UnlockedOriTx in accordance with the original chain transaction 
data format. An OriTx is used to lock the original chain assets. An UnlockedOriTx is used to unlock 
the original chain assets.
