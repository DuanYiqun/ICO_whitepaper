Thank you very much for taking the time to look into 
Invacio. My name is William James Dalrymple West, 
Invacio’s founder and CEO. I’d like to break with convention 
slightly by adding a few words to the top of this paper, 
in order to place the ICO in the much larger context of 
Invacio’s evolution over its five years of development, 
and where it stands relative to the world of tech and the 
current state of the crypto-economy. 

I fully appreciate how overwhelming 
the company can appear at first 
glance. Standing back to survey 
what’s been accomplished after so 
many years the effect even on me 
is startling. Invacio’s development 
has been an enormous project 
that’s required not only years but 
significant financial investment, 
which because I have believed in 
the project so fiercely I have always 
funded myself. At its peak, our 
development team included more 
than 70 developers working under 
my direct supervision; and even 
today, with the company relatively 
quiet before we begin to scale our 
systems, we retain 18 core full-time 
developers and 14 operations staff. 
It is no exaggeration to say Invacio 
has from its conception been not 
just the centre and circumference of 
my life, but its very meaning.

Over the course of its development 
Invacio has become a truly 
remarkable complex of integrated 
systems and products that cover 
a whole range of the world’s most 
exciting industries. Jean (Invacio’s 
AI), and the many technologies 
and solutions her capabilities are 
expressed by, are groundbreaking 
achievements. As you’ll come to 
understand, all of these offerings 
have undergone (and continuously 
undergo) rigorous testing so that 

they can be refined and eventually 
perfected. Both because we are fully 
confident in Invacio’s technologies, 
and because we are a company 
founded on and committed to 
transparency, we frequently run 
open tests of this kind for the public 
record.

Some aspects of Invacio have 
been good to go for a while already 
(our Zero-Knowledge end-to-end 
encrypted communications systems 
for example, and our AI-driven 
social network) but we’ve held off 
because of the growing importance 
of the entire architecture to their 
functioning. Over time, because 
of the integrative character of the 
technologies involved, they have 
each become more interesting 
and effective to run as a group. 
Why this is so is discussed in the 
white paper itself, but by way of 
illustration let’s consider Jean. Jean 
is Invacio’s nucleus, and just like any 
nucleus she is not self-sustaining 
but depends on other things for 
growth and activity. She’s continually 
informed by Invacio Data, which 
she has depended on — not only 
the way a brain depends on blood 
and nutrients and oxygen, but even 
more the way a child depends on 
the world for experience. 

A Personal 
Introduction

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 8 1



Her eyes and ears open to it always, 
when our systems are fully powered up 
she receives real time feeds from live 
CCTV networks worldwide, interprets 
images, listens in on audio broadcasts, 
processes shipping news, tracks 
aircraft, cars, sea-vessels, knows the 
weather, is very interested in market-
data of course (especially this); she also 
surveys the masses of data we receive 
from NASA, from live satellite feeds, and 
takes in data even from Hubble. The 
amount and disparateness of this data 
is of course astounding, but far more so 
what she does with it. Although Invacio 
Data’s original purpose had been to 
serve as Jean’s learning data, it now 
works quite as much the other way. 
Her analyses enrich our data resources 
continually, so that more and more the 
available data is proprietary, and to be 
found nowhere else in the world. The 
constant flow of this real time data, and 
Jean’s analysis of it, are no small part 
of what makes it possible for her to 
comprehend and react even to systems 
as famously difficult as stocks and the 
foreign exchange market. Exactly this 
sort of creative interdependence of 
technologies can be seen in every other 
area of Invacio’s activity.  

It was only recently that we determined 
to pursue an ICO, having originally 
intended to pursue a more conventional 
course. Yet as we came to understand 
how completely an ICO accords with 
the values that lay at the heart of the 
company — with our concern for privacy, 
security, innovation, and inclusiveness 
— it quickly became obvious that an 
ICO was far the most appropriate route 
for the company to take. In some ways, 
because of how we’ve structured this 
ICO and the measures we’re taking to 
ensure our coin becomes a significant 
player in the cryptocurrency markets, 
it now feels as if it had always been 
central to our plans. Invacio’s complex 

of technologies have not only allowed 
us to adapt to compensate for this new 
development, but have situated it in 
such a way that the existence of Invacio 
Coin has directly given rise to numerous 
other important solutions — such as 
our card and banking system Tamius of 
course, which you’ll read about below 
— but also in other ways, also touched 
upon, that will have tremendous 
implications for the long-term. Truly 
our reaching into cryptocurrency and 
blockchain has been something of a 
capstone.

The future strength and growth of 
Invacio post-launch is hardly in question. 
As you’ll see, we’ve done everything 
we can to make sure our launch and 
continued development are equal to the 
company’s promise; so in conclusion 
I’d like to highlight yet another of the 
significant differences between this ICO 
and others. I will offer every qualifying 
participant in the (INV) ICO coin sale an 
allocation of some of my personal stock. 
I hope this gift will enable those who 
might otherwise never get a chance to 
take stock in a tech company to do so, 
and allow all coin holders a second way 
to grow with Invacio through the years.

Invacio is the result of years of research 
and development by a team whose 
conceptual and practical ingenuity is 
advancing original solutions not only to 
the world’s most obstinate financial and 
intellectual interests, but also in fields as 
diverse as communications and social 
media, online privacy, and security. I ask 
that you forgive us therefore if this paper 
has no simple problem-statement-
solution structure. Quite frankly we’re 
solving problems all over the place, and 
I would have it no other way...

After five years in development, 
Invacio reaches ICO having 
evolved eleven distinct 
company divisions, each an 
expression of the capabilities 
of our core multi-agent system 
Artificial Intelligence.

No mere white paper or prototype, Invacio’s 
achievement has already shown outstanding 
performance in live tests that have run the 
whole range of our products and services, 
from our ‘Zero-Knowledge’ end-to-end 
encrypted communications, groundbreaking 
data repository and financial offerings, to 
TAMIUS, the revolutionary decentralized 
blockchain banking system that underlies our 
cryptocurrency. Several of these tests have 
been conducted live. Here for example, you 
can follow the progress of Invacio’s current 
open experiment designed to test and refine 
the interaction of certain of our financial-AI’s 
most basic features.

In the main body of this white paper you will 
find these and other of our solutions and 
research areas described in some detail, both 
to introduce the array of services your Invacio 
Coin will open for you and to demonstrate how 
— by covering key interrelated areas including 
big data, research and development, online 
security, social networking, Zero-Knowledge 
communications, blockchain technology, 
intelligence, and with our banking, fintech and 
hedge fund divisions, finance, all grounded 
in our cutting edge artificial intelligence 
technologies — Invacio’s business model is 
both rich and incredibly resilient.

Executive 
Summary

As will be seen, this 
resilience is in no small part 
due to Jean. Our core AI, 
Jean is not only a locally 
adaptive technology.

Should any combination of Invacio’s 
elements not be performing as 
we’d like, Jean has of course 
been designed to evaluate and 
refashion them so that they do; yet 
because the successes and failures 
of those elements occur always 
within a machine-learning context, 
those successes and failures 
immediately contribute also to the 
enhancement of Invacio as a whole. 
In consequence of this, Invacio is 
characterised by an astounding 
plasticity. Even now as we reach 
from data and fintech into banking 
and cryptocurrency, a greater 
part of our evolution is a matter 
of Jean’s ever more perfect and 
subtle adaptation to what secures 
Invacio’s advancement.

By taking part in this coin sale 
you are involving yourself with 
a company composed of forex 
traders, coders, data security 
specialists, “white hat” hackers, 
engineers, statisticians, thinkers, 
and entrepreneurs. Our team is 
innovative and curious and because 
fully encouraging of new ideas and 
approaches, we continue to make 
very sudden and often unpredicted 
advances in many fields. We 
therefore invite you to spend your 
time coming to know us and the 
work we’re doing by reading this 
paper, exploring our pages, and 
listening to the informational audio 
and video we have made available. 
Should you have questions not 
answered somewhere in this paper 
or on the site, you can contact us

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 8I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 8 3



In early November 2017, Invacio addressed the united Nations 
(ESCAP) on the uses of our multi-agent system AI for the ethical 
generation of wealth and the administration of disaster situations.

This honour has allowed Invacio to 
begin forging ties with several national 
governments, and has opened the door 
for discussions regarding putting our 
technologies to work in the international 
arena. Invacio therefore comes to this ICO 
in the unusual position of having already 
aroused international governmental 
interest, and, with fully conceived plans 
for the further development of several of 
our divisions (including the incorporation 
of blockchain technologies into our 
distributed AI and transactional services, 
and the refinement of the ways our core-
AI surveys, analyses and reacts to Invacio’s 
enormous data resources), a clear ethical 
mandate. Our roadmap below (see section 
5) outlines how we plan to deploy our 
technology as quickly and as effectively as 
possible.

Our ICO is also unusual in at least two 
further regards, both extensions of this 
ethical mandate. First, as detailed in 
section 1.3, (INV) ICO offers an opportunity 
to obtain shares in a company that stands 
to become a dominant force in the worlds 

of applied-AI, big data, communications, 
and finance. Gifted by Invacio’s founder 
and CEO, William James Dalrymple West, 
these shares will allow those who might 
otherwise never have had the chance to 
involve themselves in a promising tech 
startup pre-launch, usually a preserve 
of venture capitalism, to do so. Second, 
Invacio pledges to establish on launch a 
fund in its hedge fund Aquila, the returns 
from which will be devoted exclusively to 
philanthropic use. This fund will receive 
regular contributions from the company 
profits, and is to be distributed according 
to Effective Altruistic criteria. For more 
information about Effective Altruism, and 
the evaluative techniques necessary to 
ensure charitable donations are put only 
to effective use, please see the links in the 
relevant addenda of this white paper.

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 84



Due to the immediate utility of Invacio 
Coin, all areas of Invacio’s development 
are directly relevant to its value.
In the context of this ICO however, we encourage you to pay special 
attention to TAMIUS and its associated financial products and solutions. 
Tamius and its offerings function to unite crypto- and fiat currencies in 
a single secure, user-friendly multi-channel platform that offers all of the 
expected conventional banking services in addition to a number of very 
important innovations.

A free cryptocurrency-management 
highspeed app that holds both fiat and 
crypto-currencies. This app will have the 
ability to exchange an exhaustive range of 
currencies eventually, and offers INTERBANK 
RATES of exchange between fiat currencies. 

The Tamius Card, which has all the 
functionality expected of conventional 
fiat-based banking facilities, such as card 
services, bank transfers, direct debit, current/
sorting and savings accounts, IBAN, etc., 
with the added functionality of automatic 
currency conversions at interbank rates of 
exchange between all supported fiat and 
crypto-currencies. The Tamius card will allow 
instant access to funds in multiple currencies 
at ATMs worldwide. Transparent price points 
and fees are also calculated at interbank 
rates.

An Invacio Application wallet (INV Wallet) 
that will allow the user several holding 
accounts across multiple currencies (both 
fiat and crypto-currencies), each with a 
unique account ID. A solution that simplifies 
the previously complicated management of 
assets across all currency platforms.

A trial ‘INV-account freeze’ capability that will 

allow you to freeze the value of your Invacio 
Coin for up to a week at a time.

Supported by Aquila, Invacio’s AI-driven 
Hedge Fund, Tamius will offer credit services 
at market-beating rates.

With a minimum cap of 2% regardless of 
fund performance, Tamius will offer interest 
rates that track the profitability of Invacio’s 
products and company revenue growth, 
allowing customers to benefit from Invacio’s 
success directly.

Tamius will offer a long-term, hard storage 
facility.

Zero-Knowledge end-to-end encrypted 
communications services, for your security.

In the relevant sections below (see 3.1) you will find a range of original 
crypto-banking facilities described, such as:

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 8I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 8 5



Because Tamius’s capabilities are grounded on our already developed and tested AI, data, financial and Ze-
ro-Knowledge communications technologies, the time from the completion of this ICO until Tamius’s full operation 
can be expected to be greatly reduced. It is intended that the first of Tamius’s services will be launched immediate-
ly, with all remaining services to come as soon as the appropriate full operational licensing has been granted. For 
the projected timetable of Tamius’s launch, please see the Tamius section of this paper (3.1). 

A complex of solutions grounded in mass data analysis and multi-agent system artificial intelligence, Invacio stands 
to revolutionize every industry it touches. Along with the numerous developed technologies described in this 
white paper, we have plans in place for the staged release of several other services that for tactical reasons we’ve 
been unable to describe here. A further expression of our existing capabilities, these will work to make secure 
cross-border exchange easier than ever before, in ways of especial use to developing economies but of universal 
interest, and will further integrate traditional fiat and crypto-currencies. Announcements about these applications 
and services will be made in due course. Invacio will also proceed with its research into blockchain technologies, 
incorporating them into our distributed systems as appropriate. (INV) ICO is intended to permit us to launch and 
scale our resource-hungry systems independently, without making recourse to VC investment, and so to continue 
to develop according to our vision.

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 86



When we talk of Jean as 
Invacio’s core-AI, we must be 
understood to be describing 
this entire decentralized and 
autonomous community 
of collaborating intelligent 
agents and not to be 
positing some monolithic 
central computational 
architecture. This is 
important not only because 
to imply a structural centre 
to a distributed system is 
to misconstrue its character 
but also because the great 
advantage and promise 
of Multi Agent System AI 
relative to monolithic AI 
architectures is very well 
established. Whether in 
terms of real-time object, 
pattern or natural language 
recognition, or the gathering, 
cataloguing and mass 
analysis of data, or in terms 
of self-directed learning and 
emergent properties, M.A.S. 
is at the cutting edge of AI 
research. 

M.A.S. technology is 
able to solve problems at 
remarkable speeds, and 
due to Jean’s enormous 
live and historical data 
repositories, her ability to 
monitor and comprehend 
natural language and 
streaming media in real 
time, in addition to the 

over 100,000 satellite and 
CCTV networks she is fed 
by, feeds resulting from the 
help of and agreements with 
institutions such as NASA, 
she is always invigilating 
and improving her real world 
performance. She is an 
intelligence so sensitive to 
the world and its changes 
she is able both to enact 
strategies by weighing these 
historical and live data, and 
to react to the world if the 
world fails to coincide with 
her expectations.

You can hear an audio walk-
through of how Invacio 
Labs’ Applied AI and Internal 
Research divisions work 
to help augment Jean’s 
performance here. You can 
read more about Invacio 
Labs in the section devoted 
to Labs below.

Who or What is 
jean?

‘jean’ is the name we have given to the 
full operational capacity of our multi-
agent system artificial intelligence, 
a convenient way to express the 
capabilities that emerge from our 
complex of collaborative autonomous 
learning nodes, machine learning 
systems and artificial neural networks.

Jean is the ‘perfectly parallel’ autonomous 
architecture at Invacio’s core enabling us 
to gather data intelligently from the entire 
web (including the deep web) and which 
allows our fintech, for example, to project 
and act upon the movements of the various 
markets. Jean’s activity is essential to what 
has had Invacio’s fintech able to make such 
impressive returns on capital.

Jean is names after Jean West, 
grandmother to the founder William

This array of interdependent AI, Data, Investment 
and Financial technologies is an important part of 
what makes Invacio Coin such a special token. 
Invacio Coin is a new, secure, user-friendly 
cryptocurrency of immediate utility, and which 
will be available for exchange as soon as possible 
after the ICO.

An aim of this ICO is to work cryptocurrency 
fully into the mainstream, with e-commerce 
in the short term and elegant and intuitive 
cryptocurrency solutions to all real-world 
commercial transactions thereafter. It will do 
this in several ways, via the innovations of our 
Tamius Card, which will operate at interbank 
rates, and the many other fintech-backed 
offerings described below in the Tamius section 
of this white paper. These solutions are original 
crypto-banking offerings with all the conventional 
fiat banking facilities consumers are already 
familiar with, including current accounts, savings 
accounts, business accounts, hedge fund and 
merchant services. Invacio’s cryptocurrency and 
banking innovations will become as necessary 
as any major credit card or payment system is 
today. 

Recognizing early that with the inevitable coming 
regulatory pressure on tokens, as an asset class, 
may well come a very great pressure on the 

Ethereum network generally, as its grounding 
technology, we are working to put in place 
measures to ensure Invacio Coin has the greatest 
possible chance to become a dominant token, 
whatever the future brings. We have already 
ensured the utility of Invacio Coin — the access it 
will give you to the markets via Invacio’s fintech, 
is almost a key to wealth management, making 
Invacio Coin (with careful equity strategy) a kind 
of Aesop’s hen — but we also are looking very 
far ahead. 

Watchful for the character of any potential 
regulatory changes, and sensitive to the potential 
global ramifications of the recent adoption of 
cryptocurrency by certain countries and banks, 
we are developing our own blockchain — built 
for speed, privacy, stability, and security — to suit 
our future plans. To this end we have teams in 
place looking at the applications of blockchain to 
distributed-AI, and also at work testing ways that 
we can establish a blockchain able to work off-
grid (an interesting aspect of which can be seen 
in the appendix of this white paper). Just as our 
current fintech tests have been, all research after 
a certain point in development will be conducted 
with the greatest practicable transparency.

An ICO unlike any 
other before

Invacio Coin (INV) is a utility token that not only allows you to access the 
range of Invacio’s market-ready systems, from our Zero-Knowledge end-
to-end encrypted communications to our groundbreaking data repository 

and financial offerings, but also comprises the doorway to tAMIuS, 
Invacio’s decentralized blockchain banking system. 

I N V A C I O  ( I N V )  W h I t E  P A P E r  -  I N V A C I O ™  2 0 1 3 - 2 0 1 88



At the time of (INV) ICO, Invacio 
Coin is a token developed 
to ERC20 standards. These 
standards ensure that 
interactions, exchanges, smart 
contracts and wallet storage 
are seamless, secure, swift 
and straightforward, across 
all token platforms. ERC20 is 
the current gold standard of 
blockchain technology used 
by fortune 500 companies, 
with more than half of all 
cryptocurrency transactions 
conducted across the network. 
This standard is stable, strong, 
and has been widely adopted. 
Additionally, in September 
2017 ERC20 was formally and 
permanently defined, and as 
such is no longer subject to 
major change.

The widespread adoption of 
the ERC20 framework across 
multiple token platforms also 
means that any tokens built 
to the ERC20 standard can 
be easily and instantly listed 
across multiple exchanges with 
nothing more than the token 
contract address. The same 
applies to the listing of any and 
all ERC20 compliant tokens 
in one wallet, providing a 
centralized point of access for 
all your cryptocurrencies. Due 
to its widespread use in token 
creation and distribution at this 
time, therefore, as well as for the 
other conveniences outlined 
in the paragraphs above, we 
have felt ERC20 far the most 
appropriate solution for Invacio 
Coin. Our development team 
are however paying particular 
attention to the development of 
the ERC223 protocols, which 
are currently evolving, and 
should ERC223 be shown to 
be a definitive improvement it 
will be adopted. 

The launch of INVACIO COIN 
will serve several purposes, 
raising the capital required 
to begin launching our many 
solutions to market, quickly 
and robustly. All platforms and 
services outlined in this White 
Paper are either ready or close 
to ready for market release 
and can be read about in their 
dedicated sections below, as 

well as on their webpages. 
There are also a number of very 
helpful audio walkthroughs of 
our developed solutions to be 
found on the landing page of the 
main site, alongside an audio 
recording of the presentation 
Invacio made to the United 
Nations (ESCAP) in early 
September this year on the 
use of our multi-agent system 
AI for the ethical generation of 
wealth and the administration 
of disaster situations.

 Invacio’s AI technologies are 
extremely resource hungry, 
and our biggest overhead 
currently is the expense of 
running the powerful servers 
that support our system (Jean) 
and her infrastructure. As we 
scale out this will become an 
increasingly pressing issue. 
How the funds resulting from 
this coin-sale will be put to use 
— including the scaling of the 
company’s infrastructure, the 
recruitment of appropriate staff, 
server upgrades, data centres 
created, and stringent systems 
testing to ensure performance 
— is detailed clearly in the 
company forecast sections.

Invacio’s founder and CEO, 
William James Dalrymple West, 
has chosen to offer to qualifying 
participants a gift of shares in 
the company as part of this 
coin sale. From the outset he 
has insisted on inclusiveness 
as a value essential to his vision 
of the company. We have 
therefore taken great care in 
our calculations to allow those 
who might otherwise never 
have had the chance to obtain 
shares in a tech start-up, to do 
just that. Three percent of the 
company equity has been set 
aside for this purpose, to be 
distributed manually via British 
Companies House, Invacio’s 
Seychelles division, and our 
legal team, following the 
completion of the ICO, to those 
who choose to accept this 
offer. The details and process 
of William’s gifting from his 
personal stock allocation are 
listed on the next page.

the launch of INVACIO 
COIN will serve several 
purposes, raising the 
capital required to begin 
launching our many 
solutions to market, 
quickly and robustly.

Due to the range of solutions 
Invacio offers and our global 
reach, we have sites in several 
regions specific to purpose.
These sites are necessary for reason of law, 
taxation, accountancy, property-development, 
and infrastructure. After INV ICO these registered 
sites will increase in number by a further 7 or 8 
we estimate, in order to install servers for our 
own networks and to enable Jean and our 
services to come online. 

Some of these registered locations are privately 
owned by members of the Invacio team, 
and in a number of cases operate in other 
industries, such as logistics, fisheries, finance, 
or accountancy for example. Invacio to-date 
has utilized these locations in some instances as 
server rooms, with a logistics compound in the 
heart of Bangkok. In the case of the West Quay 
of the family owned RC enterprise, ownership 
dates back some 300  years.

Tamius is Invacio’s 
decentralized blockchain 
banking system.
ts transactional solutions effectively 
integrate crypto- and traditional fiat 
currencies, making cross-currency and 
cross-border transactions simple and 
intuitive for all users. The following is a 
breakdown of Tamius:

 

What Tamius Will Achieve?
Tamius and its offerings function to unite 
crypto- and fiat currencies in a single 
secure, user-friendly multi-channel 
platform that offers all of the expected 
conventional banking services in 
addition to a number of very important 
innovations. 

Currency 
Management 
Application
A free cryptocurrency-
management highspeed app 
that holds both fiat and crypto-
currencies. This app will have the 
ability to exchange an exhaustive 
range of currencies, and will offer 
interbank rates of exchange. 
This to our knowledge is the first 
offering of its kind to come to 
market.
 

Desktop UI 
Application
A simple and intuitive desktop 
and online user interface that will 
allow fast and secure exchange 
and transfer of cryptocurrencies 
and traditional fiat currencies.

Integrated 
Functionality of 
Services
Tamius has all the functionality 
expected of conventional fiat-
based banking facilities, such as 
card services, bank transfers, 
direct debit, current/sorting and 
savings accounts, IBAN, etc., 
with the added functionality of 
automatic currency conversions 
at interbank rates of exchange 
between all supported fiat and 
crypto-currencies. 
 

Tamius Card
The Tamius Card will finally allow 
you to take your cryptocurrency 
out into the world. Because 
the card is directly connected 
to your INV digital wallet, 
transactions can be made 
virtually and at point of sale 
(POS). The Tamius Card is 
international and provides 
holders with instant access 
to funds at ATMs worldwide. 
Transparent price points and 
fees calculated at interbank rates 
make the Tamius Card the ideal 

medium for using digital currency 
to make real world purchases. 
Your cryptocurrencies can 
be accessed whenever and 
wherever you need them. 
 

Ease of Use 
Our Invacio Coin banking 
platform allows all necessary 
exchange and conversion 
calculations to be performed 
instantaneously, which means 
that at long last the currency 
holder can make cryptocurrency 
transactions without having to 
transfer exact currency amounts 
to a vendor, making the process 
as simple and effective as 
traditional fiat card transactions.

Short-Term Fund 
freezing capability
A trial short-term ‘INV-account 
freeze’ capability that will allow 
you to freeze the value of your 
Invacio Coin for up to a week at 
a time. One of the reasons that 
cryptocurrency has enabled so 
many people to make so much 
money has been its historic 
volatility. In consequence of this 
volatility traders and holders 
have seen significant increases 
in the value of their holdings, all 
within relatively short timeframes. 
As with any asset however, 
cryptocurrency values can 
decrease as well as increase, 
meaning the ideal crypto 
investor will follow and account 
for market movements at all 
times in order to maximise gains 
and minimise losses. In daily life, 
however, this is often impossible. 
Invacio’s crypto account (INV 
Account) has therefore been 
designed to allow you to freeze 
the current exchange value of 
your Invacio Coin holdings. In 
effect this means that if you can’t 
monitor your wallet, or if you 
wish to lock in gains that you 
have made, without exchanging 
your cryptocurrency, then you 
can do just that, for up to 30 
days.

One Wallet/
Application For 
Everything
Tamius’s wallet Application 
(INV Wallet) allows the user 
several holding accounts 
across multiple currencies 
(both fiat and crypto), each 
with a unique account ID. 
A solution that simplifies 
the previously complicated 
management of assets 
across all currency platforms. 
The INV Wallet will launch 
with the following:

• INV 
• BTC
• LTC 
• ETH 
• USD 
• GBP 
• EUR 
• Fiat Exotics 
• Crypto Altcoins 

The wallet will release 
in stages according 
to licensing, legal and 
capability requirements, 
and will comply with Anti 
Money Laundering / Know 
Your Customer rules and 
regulations where required.

Credit, Loans, 
Savings, Bonds, 
Investments and 
Trading Services
Supported by Aquila, Tamius 
will offer credit services at 
market-beating rates. Aquila 
is likewise an important 
part of the power behind 
Invacio’s savings, bonds, 
investments and fintech 
services. With a minimum 
interest cap of 2% regardless 
of fund performance, Tamius 
will offer rates that track 
the profitability of Invacio’s 
products and company 
revenue growth, allowing 
customers to be able to 
benefit directly from Invacio’s 
success.

Long Term Funds 
Securing Option
Invacio will offer a long-term, 
hard storage facility. This will 
be a secured vault, protected 
from both the elements and 
external connectivity. This 
facility will allow us to pull 
funds offline and freeze them 
at your request, offering you 
also the ability to deposit 
funds into a highly secure, 
24/7 guarded site. We will 
secure these funds in the 
same fashion as any other 
regulated bank. Invacio 
Labs is currently working 
on a similar mechanism to 
be rolled out for our crypto-
banking offerings, to give 
our users peace of mind that 
their funds are fully secure. 
Just as with our loans, 
investments, savings and 
credit solutions, secured 
funds will receive exceptional 
capped-minimum rates of 
interest that track and benefit 
from Invacio’s performance.
 

Unhackable 
Communications 
Channels
The ultimate in 
communications security, 
Invacio’s Zero-Knowledge 
end-to-end encrypted 
communication systems are 
the framework upon which 
all of Invacio’s technologies 
are built. We have developed 
our systems to give you 
complete peace of mind 
when communicating 
even the most sensitive 
information. Whether by 
email, messenger, voice, or 
video call, no content (not 
even any metadata) can 
be intercepted or hacked. 
Everything sent is client-side 
encrypted so that not even 
Invacio can access it without 
the appropriate permissions. 
Such communications 
security is offered 
automatically by Invacio. 

Off-grid Secure 
Transactions
In consequence of the 
research done by the Applied 
Tech division at Invacio 
Labs, Tamius is able to offer 
a military grade, secure 
and free to operate online 
communications framework 
that will allow transactions 
to be conducted even in 
the remotest and densest 
of environments. WeNet 
(for details about the 
development of WeNet, 
please see the appendix) 
does not require the internet 
infrastructure, nor does it 
require a cellular network. 
Instead it uses ingenious 
methods to create a stable 
and portable internet 
gateway, in areas with 
zero internet connectivity. 
WeNet offers completely 
secure, stable, independent 
end-to-end encrypted 
communications systems 
for voice, video, financial 
and data communications in 
areas where this would be 
otherwise impossible.

Developed in consultation 
with experts from 
institutions including 
NASA and Facebook 
HHVM, as well as 
world-experts in IT 
and security, predictive 
analytics, statistics, and 
trading, Invacio Data is 
a truly groundbreaking 
achievement.
Already far in excess of two billion data 
sets and ever growing, Invacio Data is 
the richest resource of organized real 
time and historical data of its kind.

Because our AI is constantly at work 
seeking out, gathering and organizing 
all the available data it can, reaching 
through and harvesting from database 
and non-database sources all over 
the web — including even the deep 
web — as well as mining from data-
rich objects, such as the more than 
100,000 satellite links and CCTV 
networks Invacio Data is fed by, with 
natural language comprehension and 
sentiment analytic capabilities so that 
the content of live news and media 
can be continually monitored and 

comprehended in real time, Invacio 
ingeniously transforms noise from the 
diversest possible range of material into 
valuable and actionable information. 
In addition to the movements of the 
exchange markets or other industry 
specific information, Data tracks and 
registers the movement of the oceans, 
of the weather, of shipping and air-
traffic control data, fishing routes, the 
orbits of satellites, tracks floods and 
crop yields, population distributions, 
electricity consumption, and so much 
more, even extending far beyond the 
Earth's boundaries, being fed data-
streams by NASA. Indeed, Invacio’s 
AI is able to see so much data at 
once that it can track the whole 
world through its changes, registering 
growths and diminishments and 
correlations that open the incredible 
complexity of the interactions and 
routes these objects and events weave 
and are woven into. For the first time 
we are perhaps beginning to glimpse 
certain deep constitutive relations 
that might otherwise have remained 
completely unknown, but which 
known are exploitable. These datasets 
and streams comprise also the vast 
pool of training data essential for 
Jean’s development. Nourishing and 
honing herself on this data, they are 
an important reason she has become 

such an accurate and formidable 
a technology. In turn, the results of 
Jean’s continuous analytic work on 
this mass of data directly supply 
Invacio Data, so that the available data 
is increasingly proprietary, and is to be 
found nowhere else.

Invacio Data provides companies 
and individuals with all manner 
of data in any conceivable area 
or discipline. No matter whether 
what’s desired are data on finance, 
manufacture, research, is statistical 
or logistical, pertains to business, or 
governance, to geopolitical relations 
and anthropogeographic distributions, 
to climatology, meteorology, industry, 
mining, agriculture, to the travel and 
hospitality sectors, consumer-habits, 
or health — and however that data is 
to be related and analyzed — if there 
is a database on it somewhere Invacio 
should have it, and where a database 
does not exist Invacio’s AI will attempt 
to determine and generate it. 

Whatever the client’s experience in 
data analysis our team can help find a 
way to establish the correlations and 
predictions by analysis that matter 
for them, whatever their industry or 
purpose. Invacio data is Invacio’s 
engine room, opened up for you to fuel 
your own innovations by...

Note roll-out of APIs (inc billing) will be post ICO.



Invacio API (Application 
Programmer’s Interface) 
is the result of our having 
isolated certain key 
functional components 
from the machinery of 
Invacio’s solutions, and 
making these components 
available for your own use.
Several are essential utilities such as 
our media analysis API, which provides 
access to raw and analyzed media-
content, and among other things is 
able to recognize objects, establish 
identities (to put names to faces), 
approximate biometrics such as height 
and weight, specify gender, and can 
even evaluate and track emotional 
states. 

 We have also made available APIs able 

to identify, interpret and extract written 
language, which can then be subjected 
to sentiment-analysis; being able to 
appreciate the tone of phrase, even 
when the language use is sarcastic or 
ironic, this is an invaluable capability in 
a world where a single tweet can so 
vehemently and drastically affect the 
markets. Additionally, there are APIs 
for Landmark Detection, identifying 
natural and man-made structures 
within media, and therefore able to 
locate the picture or video. 

 Using machine-learning technology, 
Invacio’s media API enables users to 
moderate offensive visual, audio and 
written content. It also uses the power 
of Invacio Spider AI to find topical 
entities like Public Figures, logos, and 
products, which combined with our 
comparative visual-similarity detector 
can locate and retrieve similar images 
from the web at large. There is also 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR), 
and Voice Recognition, enabling you 

to detect text and the spoken word 
within media, and to collect and run 
sophisticated sentiment analysis on 
them as a group.

These APIs have been described by 
way of example and are few among 
the enormous range of APIs Invacio 
offers...

Begun in late august 2017 
the Archimedes fund is 
an experiment intended 
to test and help refine 
the interaction of certain 
features of Invacio’s 
financial technology.
Though originally intended to be only a 
reactive trading-bot, designed to listen 
in on the written and spoken news — 
and to social networks such as twitter, 
and Facebook — since conception 
Archimedes has undergone several 
enhancements and the experiment 
broadened to incorporate other 
elements of Invacio’s fintech, such 
as that responsible for anticipating 
movement in the exchange markets. In 
consequence of this it is now able to 
project into the future, and also react 
to current global and financial events. 
This means Archimedes has become a 
trading intelligence so sensitive to the 

world and its changes that it is now 
able both to enact trading strategy 
by weighing the historical and live 
technical data …and also to react to 
the world if that world fails to coincide 
with its expectations.

The kinds of analysis Archimedes 
conducts can be found sketched in 
the non-linear flow diagram on the 
Archimedes webpage, along with a 
little of the Archimedes code that we 
have chosen to make open source. 
The flow diagram shows how the data 
streams enter the system and are first 
processed so that any inconsistencies 
in the data are resolved and then 
analyzed and evaluated so that 
Archimedes knows whether to open 
new trades, or to keep or close on 
existing positions.

Archimedes has been designed 
always to push an advantage so that 
gains are maximized; yet there are 
also rules of equity management in 
place to ensure that drawdowns are 

kept to a minimum. As the Archimedes 
fund has grown the experiment has 
further broadened to apply longer-
term trading strategies.Though only a 
tiny part of Invacio’s fintech division, 
Archimedes has become a formidable 
technology, and a successful test will 
result in its being fully incorporated into 
our combined trading division, Aquila. 

At this time Archimedes remains a 
private Friends/Family/Developer test-
fund, and is not open to the public. 
The Archimedes page is updated soon 
after market close each week.

Powered by Invacio’s 
live and historic data 
resources, and by Jean, 
Invacio’s groundbreaking 
Multi-Agent System 
Artificial Intelligence, 
Agnes is a flagship 
product of Invacio’s 
fintech division offering 
analysis and projections 
for every major currency 
pair and equity.
Agnes collects and tracks companies 
from all the world’s main stock 
exchanges — including NYSE, 
Euronext, Nikkei, and NASDAQ — and 
presents the results of its analyses 
and projections by way of an easy to 
use online console, via SMS, or by 
CSV file. Featuring market sentiment 
scores, probability indicators, and 

predicted End of Period prices, among 
many other features, Agnes gives clear 
market intelligence and entry signals 
enabling users to quickly identify the 
day’s best trading options and pre-
empt market movements, regardless 
of the market being targeted. 

In addition to exploiting the vastness 
of Invacio’s data repository for its 
projections, Agnes works with 
historical and real-time information on 
every company and currency, tracking 
news, analyst coverage, social media 
mentions, financials, industry-specific 
trends, as well as surveying satellite 
feeds, weather reports, and evaluating, 
for example, regional conflicts and 
natural disasters. In consequence 
of this it is able to react to changes 
in sentiment to anticipate market 
movements. 

In October 2017 Invacio Labs extended 
Agnes’s range to offer analysis and 
projections also for each of the major 
Forex currency pairs, and intra-day 

projections for the major equities, and 
will soon further extend into crypto-
currencies. Agnes’s projections will 
cover intraday, end of quarter, and end 
of year values.

Because it is an expression of Jean’s 
autonomous machine learning 
systems, the accuracy of Agnes’s 
forecasts, currently around 80%, 
is showing steady improvement. 
This means that with careful equity 
management Agnes can offer a 
significant edge to the experienced 
and novice trader alike.

Hedge funds allow 
investors to increase 
holdings in both up and 
down markets, and are 
the secret behind the 
largest fortunes made 
and kept growing in the 
investment world.
Unlike traditional investments which 
buy an asset or instrument and hold 
it for a certain period of time in the 
expectation its value will increase, 
hedge funds not only buy-and-hold 
assets but routinely go short, selling an 
asset or instrument they do not own 
with the expectation that the asset 
or instrument will be worth less at a 
future time. This means that whereas a 
market downturn is a serious threat to 
a Buy and Hold Fund, for a hedge fund 
it is an important opportunity. Anyone 
who held traditional investments 
through the 2008 crash, the earlier 
Dotcom Bubble in 2000, or the many 
other periodic market crashes, will 
know the sinking feeling of opening 

up balance statements during those 
treacherous times. Those invested in a 
hedge fund however would have been 
waiting expectantly for their balance 
statements. And when the market is 
booming and making higher highs? 
Hedge funds also trade in Buy & Hold 
mode, so either way a market is going, 
a correctly managed hedge fund is 
going along with it.

Aquila is a hedge fund led by 
experienced hedge fund managers, 
senior executives from Wall Street, 
Canary Wharf, and the private wealth 
management sectors. Aquila applies 
the full power of Invacio’s fintech, 
which working with enormous 
resources of organized historic 
and real-time data and responsive 
technologies has already showed 
such outstanding results in testing.  
Because Invacio’s multi-agent system 
AI is constantly educating and testing 
itself, and utilizing natural-language 
comprehensive and sentiment-analytic 
technologies is scanning always for 
the best opportunities in any kind of 
market, the opportunities it identifies 
and the swiftness of its reaction to 

changes in market behavior promise 
to situate Aquila at the very pinnacle 
of the investment world. Due to this 
— in addition to its team of industry 
professionals able to monitor, interpret 
and evaluate the investments, and to 
impose proven equity management 
controls — Aquila has a very real edge 
on the investment market.

In late August 2017, Invacio Labs 
began a live test of certain elements of 
its financial technology.

In 2012, Dennis A. Chen 
and Mark Sebastian 
published a landmark 
book titled The Option 
Trader’s Hedge Fund – 
A Business Framework 
for Trading Equity and 
Index Options. TOMIC 
is an acronym coined in 
the book that stands for 
The One Man Insurance 
Company.
The book lays out a practical model 
for trading options: buying and selling 
them while limiting the risk involved, 
to generate steady profits from the 
operation, as well as allowing good 
exposure to Black Swan events. Black 
Swan events are extreme shifts in 
the market, such as the 2008 market 
crash. While these events are rare, they 
do happen frequently enough to allow 
for extreme profits where a portfolio is 

properly structured.

Tomahawk is Invacio Aquila’s 
implementation of the TOMIC 
framework, combining its strength 
with our proprietary stock and index 
analysis for selecting trades, and 
our equity management protocols. 
Tomahawk relies on 5 components to 
select trades with the highest likelihood 
of profit, all handled by our AI:

• Market Selection
• Market Direction
• Timing
• Volatility
• Pricing

Managing these 5 components across 
all markets that trade options allows 
Tomahawk to select the best trades for 
any given week or month. And since 
this is being done by our AI, there is 
no sleeping at the wheel. Everything 
is being looked at constantly and no 
good opportunities are missed.

Once a trade has been identified 
as meeting the conditions, risk 
management kicks in. Every trade 
is assessed to determine the right 

position size (number of contracts) 
and the strategy to be used (buying, 
selling, both) to allow for the desired 
profit and keep the possible loss within 
the guidelines.

The combination of all the above 
elements constitutes Tomahawk’s 
Trading Plan, a proprietary strategy 
that allows us to increase the assets 
under management as safely as is 
possible in market trading. We are 
obviously looking for profits beyond 
what can be had through “safe” 
instruments such as CDs, Municipal 
Bonds, T-Bonds, and the like, that offer 
tiny but guaranteed returns and almost 
no risk of capital loss. TOMAHAWK 
looks for faster growth and accepts a 
higher risk profile in order to gain it.

Zero-Knowledge and a 
commitment to privacy 
sit at the very heart of 
Invacio’s design. But what 
does Zero-Knowledge 
mean?
Zero-Knowledge was originally a 
cryptographic concept relating to the 
ability to prove a statement true while 
disclosing no information about the 
content of that statement. For Invacio’s 
email-service Invmail however, Zero-
Knowledge means we’ve not only 
zero information about the content of 
any file you send but we have zero 
information about any related content 
or metadata either. Everything sent is 
client-side encrypted — becoming 
before we receive it merely a chaos of 
data blocks, of ones and zeros — we 
can’t even tell the type or the size of 
the file sent — and what is sent can be 
decrypted only by a recipient with the 
appropriate key. 

This matters for privacy because it 
means however many subpoenas 
are issued, however many servers 
confiscated, however much money is 
offered or however many threats are 
made, there is nothing we can do to 
hand over the content of any file, nor 
any information about the content of 
a file. No one can intercept and read 
that content or access it through us, 
because not even we can access your 
data. There is simply no possible way 
to do so. This is a solution that allows 
all content to be instantly secured 
and securely transmitted through 
a notoriously insecure medium. So 
regardless of which of our services you 
are using — and we have extended 
our Zero-Knowledge technology to 
cover all of Invacio’s communications 
services, including messenger service, 
video and audio calls and — you can 
do so in complete confidence. 

Moreover, should your communications 
no longer be needed or wanted, 
Invmail comes with ‘burn functionality.’ 
This means messages can be instantly 

destroyed, irretrievably, and even 
the pathways used for their storage 
repeatedly overwritten, obliterating 
every trace of the exchange. After 
choosing to burn, the systems these 
communications are channeled by 
retain no record of the information 
that has passed through them. This is 
one of the ways Invacio is redefining 
online privacy, providing secure portals 
through which sensitive, confidential 
information can be sent, and allowing 
users the peace of mind that comes 
from knowing that their Invacio-
mediated correspondence cannot be 
subject to keyword tracking ...indeed 
cannot be subjected to tracking or 
hacking of any kind.

How does the market 
view you? Your product? 
Your company? Your 
competition? What does 
the world think?
Assisted by Jean’s spiders (bots which 
trawl the webs) and Invacio Data, Alise 
pulls in and analyzes all data relevant 
to a targeted organization or product 
and returns the results to you clearly, 
via dynamic charts and reports. This 
enables detection of problems or 
opportunities far in advance of what 
would otherwise be possible. Alise will 
tell how an organization or products 
stands in public opinion, allowing 
reputations and brands to be finessed 
and the actual market position to be 
determined. It similarly allows the 
evaluation of the performance and 
standing of competition. 

Through the noise and chatter of 
the internet Alise is able to make 

sense of the complex interactions 
which are having or will have an 
impact on a business, and Alise is 
where Invacio’s great strength in 
sentiment analysis and real time 
natural language comprehension is 
seen at its most immediately effective. 
Able to recognize changes in market 
conditions, to read, sentiment analyze 
and respond to the written and spoken 
word, with historical and real-time data 
on every company and product, able 
to track news, analyst coverage, social 
media mentions, financials, industry-
specific trends, and extending its 
reach into even the darkest corners of 
the internet to retrieve all data relevant 
to a company or product. With Alise 
you will know what is being said as it 
is being said, and whether the market 
climate is positive or negative.

There is a real, very significant 
advantage given by understanding 
where your own or a competitor’s 
strengths and weaknesses lay; and 

because Alise’s work is relevant both 
immediately as well as in long term, it 
is of value also to investors and traders 
interested to know how a company is 
performing or is likely to perform.

Our AI’s ability to conduct these kinds 
of targeted and exploratory searches 
mean that Alise is a technology without 
competition that will very soon be 
found indispensable to a company’s 
everyday operations, whatever its 
market or industry.

security specialists — 
experts in areas such 
as “white hat” hacking, 
cryptography, automated 
threat intelligence, 
penetration testing, threat 
analysis, and vulnerability 
management — and 
growing directly from the 
research done at Invacio 
Labs.
Invacio Security works to combine and 
apply the whole power of its artificial 
intelligence, machine learning and 
data-analytic technologies to create 
original intelligence and cyber-security 
solutions.

Using visual, auditory, and natural 
language recognition on streaming 
media, and the over 100,000 live 
satellite and CCTV networks Invacio 
is fed by — networks that span the 

entire globe, including public places 
such as airports, car parks, shopping 
malls, and entertainment and industrial 
complexes — Invacio is able to keep 
autonomous, inexhaustible, and 
intelligent watch for notable and 
wanted figures. The system is not only 
able to be trained to recognize, locate 
and track these figures in real-time, 
but because constantly seeking out, 
gathering, analyzing and marshalling 
all the data it can from every available 
source — reaching through and 
harvesting directly from database and 
non-database sources all over the 
web, including the deep web — this 
enormous wealth of data is associated 
and clustered to reveal relations 
and patterns which might otherwise 
never come to light — allowing 
comprehensive pictures of movements 
and associations to be drawn.

Such technologies in combination 
with Invacio’s APIs — allow identities 
and locations to be established, 
biometrics such as height and weight 
approximated, gender specified, 
key facial attributes and decorations 
determined, emotional states evaluated 

and tracked, and allow even the written 
and spoken word to be picked out 
from media in real time, comprehended 
and sentiment analyzed. Invacio 
ingeniously transforms noise from 
the most diverse possible range of 
mediums into information invaluable 
for intelligence, defence, and security.

Invacio Security has created a 
technology so sensitive to and 
observant of the world and its changes 
it is able to keep pace with security and 
intelligence threats, however quickly 
they evolve.

The above are only a small number of 
the ways in which Invacio’s data, API  
and AI-technologies might be applied, 
and given by way of example. Our

politics and business. labs falls into several 
departments: 

APPLIED AI DIVISION
Led by William James Dalrymple West, Invacio’s 
Applied AI division looks to the performance of our 
multi-agent system Artificial Intelligence and associated 
technologies, and is responsible also for the private 
and public experiments and tests we conduct …such 
as our current experiment examining aspects of our 
fintech, which you can follow at Archimedes.invacio.
com. Whether Investigating applications of blockchain 
technology, creating new API or developing the 
technical, statistical and analytical tools used elsewhere 
by Invacio, the Applied division is the engine rooms of 
Invacio’s Research division, which has both Internal and 
External departments…

INVACIO RESEARCH DIVISION 

(i) Internal Research

As impressive as any artificial intelligence and data 
store might be, there are always gaps and limitations 
of some kind in ability and resources. Original research 
never conducted before — so where there simply is 
no data of relevance available — is one such an area. 
Recognising this, Internal Research works to find ways 
to help the AI overcome any expressive limitations by 
conducting precisely the research that is lacking, finding 
and introducing novel perspectives and avenues for 
investigation, and working out what information would 
be most useful and relevant to have Jean recognize 
a need to revise her assumptions. Internal Research 
therefore attempts to formulate and study vital questions 
which have never been asked.  
 

(ii) External Research

Invacio’s External Research department operates almost 
as a think-tank — this ‘almost’ is important, because the 
way it works is in certain respects very different, being 
hardly top down at all. With no favourite theories and 
theoretic structures that determine the results of our 
work, and certainly not the work of any AI we utilize, the 

only informative prejudicial structures are those which 
have to do with the nature of scientific practice itself. In 
contradistinction to other think tanks, at Invacio Labs the 
world has the last say always, however much one might 
prefer the world were otherwise. We check and recheck 
our data and analyses as carefully and rigorously as 
possible, to make certain it’s right. This, in short, just 
is the meaning of the scientific method. No matter 
how much one desires the world to conform to some 
favoured model, there’s only one way to find out whether 
it does, and that’s by prioritizing the world itself — and 
so our analyses and data utilizes the work of our core-
AI, which we have developed and sensitized so that it’s 
able to feel its own way into the world, and modify itself 
accordingly. Because of this bottom up approach, from 
information to interpretation and solution, the world itself 
always being the tribunal — because we test our ideas 
and data — our External Research division is better able 
to advise agencies and governments and companies on 
effective policy than think tanks and research institutes 
which are ideologically structured, and which grow ideas 
and strategies from that ideological base. The AI-driven 
natural language and statistical technology we use for 
example, being not only sensitive to public sentiment 
but being capable of anticipating and projecting 
shifts of public opinion, will be an extraordinarily 
powerful instrument for determining governmental and 
economic policies and solutions. Invacio Labs is also a 
resource extremely valuable to anyone looking for new 
perspectives and intelligence, whether to enable them 
to improve profits or hit certain targets, or to generate 
new ideas for ways to develop and refine and perfect 
their own practices…

APPLIED TECH DIVISION 
Development in Labs pursues also practical tech 
solutions. For an example of the many ways in which 
Invacio Labs has already explored real world solutions, 
please see section three in the Appendix.

Invacio’s systems have been built from the ground up with security as a 
priority. We use proxy servers for our front-end interfaces because they 
allow us to utilize global frameworks to deliver our sites and products to the 
end user with little or no downtime. Importantly this also protects Invacio 
from DDoS attacks.

System 
Security

In the heart of our team you will find James 
Smith, the crypto and security specialist who 
guided the development of Invmail, our Zero-
Knowledge communication system. Due to 
his guidance and our development team’s 
tenacity, we are able deliver a functional 
system that builds on the theory of Security 
through Obscurity (STO). 

The concept of security through or by obscurity 
relies on non-disclosure of information 
related to the structure, the functioning and 
implementation of the object/data or of the 
considered process/flow in order to protect 
its security. This applies to the sensitive fields 
of computing, cryptology, weapons, etc. -

System Development Executive, Ben 
Rengsomboon had this to say about 
our financial security precautions:

“In a nutshell the computers holding the keys will 
be kept offline, in a secure location, constructed 
from reinforced concrete so nobody can break 
into the vault to physically steal the computers 
containing the keys. This would be further protected 
by a Faraday Cage so that no wireless signals can 
actually penetrate the room where the computers 
will be located.

There will be a rolling amount of liquidity available live 
which customers will use but the bulk of the currency 
will be kept offline or in cold storage and backed up 
so it's physically impossible for any hacker to steal 
any major amount from Invacio.

Then there will be a computer which transacts 
with that computer which will also be offline but 
connected to another computer which will be several 
layers behind our firewall, making it more difficult to 
make off with anything of major value.

The firewall will be cutting edge, a number of 
computers and the main storage computer will be 
kept in a vault which only communicates with one 
other computer and the vast majority of the time will 
be kept offline. Then another computer buried a few 
layers in behind a firewall which will have the daily 
purse for cash flow. Basically, it’s totally safe.”

DNS reflection 
Attacks

In the case of an DNS reflection 
Attack, an attacker gathers 
resources such as botnets or 
unsecured DNS recursion, and 
imitates the target IP address. 
the resources then send a flood 
of replies to the target knocking it 
offline. 

Invacio’s client identification and registration 
systems are rigorously protected against 
hijacking. Domain hijacking can occur at the 
registrar level if an attacker compromises 
a registrar account and changes the name 
server or other registration information 
associated with a domain. The registrar, 
believing that the changes originated from 
an authorized registrant, sends the new 
information to the registry. Recently several 
ICO’s have been subjected to these types 
of attacks, costing them millions of dollars. 
Invacio takes security extremely seriously. We 
use every available means to protect you, your 
personal information and your money.

this security capability has 
been fully audited by a third 
party security consultancy 
and will be subject to regular 
upgrades and ongoing threat 
analysis.

As you have seen, Invacio is a unique start-up with an 
astounding complex of products built around multi-agent 
system AI and mass data stores gathered by and derived 
from Jean’s exploratory and dedicated analysis, and our 
research at Labs.

Strategic Vision 
Post ICO

Our finance specialist, 
Andres Pedraza describes 
his vision for Invacio’s future 
in the following words:

“My passion lies in the financial 
markets, and trading specifically, 
but the markets are influenced 
by everything else. At this point, 
Operations encompass guiding 
the development of each of the 
areas that Jean is focused on, and 
making sure that the initial direction 
is the proper one. Jean will quickly 
surpass the capacity of its creators 
to teach her new things, and is 
already applying herself to build new 
rules and data relationships. But a 
guiding hand is key at this stage.”

By her very nature, Jean always 
works to seek out and process 
all the data she can, adapting 
her methods to further refine 
and generate new capabilities. 
In consequence of her activity, 
she continually pushes into the 
diversest areas of activity. 

It is essential, especially given 
the global nature of Invacio’s 
operations, that Invacio ensures 
all regulatory aspects of the 
business are adhered to. In a 
global marketplace this is no 
small task. As almost our first 
act following the acquisition 
of adequate funding, Invacio 

will employ the services of a 
panel of international regulatory 
consultants whose duty it will be 
to ensure these requirements are 
fully met.

In order to  promote our services 
successfully, Invacio will launch 
with a marketing budget of 
approximately 3 million USD. 
Chief Marketing Officer Oded 
Ilan has analysed the necessary 
requirements for bringing Invacio 
to global public attention and 
has made the following budget 
recommendations:

Invacio’s team already has a 
network of contacts, clients and 
suppliers that spans the globe. 
Moreover, In November 2017 
Invacio was extended an invitation 
to address the United Nations 
(ESCAP). This honour allowed us 
to explain how countries might 
use their access to Invacio’s 
Da t a / e n c r y p t i o n / s e c u r i t y 
offerings to enable them to attract 
tech investors, to use that data to 

create “co-operative tech Hubs” 
or “A.I. Zones,” and allow them 
even to skip foreign investment all 
together, and access our trading 
technologies and strategies to 
generate their own profits though 
our AI-driven Hedge Fund. One of 
Invacio’s central strengths is the 
remarkable variety of integrated 
solutions it has to offer.

John Marshall, Chief of Strategy 
and Director of Studies at Labs 
External Research has this to say:

“Our company strategy has long 
been in place, and the question is 
not a matter of how that strategy 
will evolve so much as how we have 
made certain the company is such 
that it can evolve… Among the most 
impressive and interesting of Invacio’s 
qualities is its plasticity, due in large 
part to a multi-agent system AI much 
of whose work is autonomous and 
generalizable. This means Invacio is 
not just locally adaptive — i.e., should 
any combination of Invacio’s divisions 
not be performing as we’d like, Jean 
will already have begun to evaluate 
and refashion them so they do perform 
— but also that the success or failure 
of any one activity by the AI occurs in 
a machine-learning context, and so 
contributes to the enhancement of 
Invacio as a whole. Even now as we 
reach from fintech into banking and 
cryptocurrency, our evolution is only 
a matter of an ever more perfect and 
subtle adaptation to what secures 
Invacio’s advancement.”

He goes on to say:
 
“Covering key areas as diverse as 
big data, research and development, 
online security, social networking, 
natural language and media analysis, 
Zero-Knowledge communications, 
blockchain technology, intelligence 
and finance, the fronts we have 
opened have been chosen quite 
deliberately. They not only ensure a 
rich and incredibly resilient business 
model but also that the business — 
precisely because guided by our AI 
— develops almost with the cunning 
of a fluid. There is no false rigidity 
of purpose or willful insistence on 
company direction, to operate which 
way would be to deprive us of our 

greatest advantage. We know both 
what we want for the company, and 
that whatever comes we are ready for 
it.”

Over and above our technology, a richness 
we greatly prize is the variety and depth 
of experience that our team members 
— including the several institutes and 
numerous advisors we continue to lean 
on for counsel — bring to the project. 
Invacio has been outstandingly fortunate 
during its development in this regard. This 
wealth of experience comes from areas 
as disparate even as high-end luxury 
fashion, mountain resort technologies, 
finance, trading, science, mathematics, 
online security, finance, international 
taxation law, AI technologies, heavy 
engineering, academia, and literature... 
Invacio’s spirit has always been one of 
collaboration and discovery,  and as a 
team we are excited to begin scaling our 
infrastructure and manpower, so that we 
can put the resources we have created 
to work and realize the many benefits 
these technologies make possible.

Immediately after the launch of the 
services and technologies in place for 
Q1-2, Invacio has in mind a number of 
communications and financial offerings 
which for various tactical reasons 
we have decided not to include. The 
technology for these is already in place 
and announcements will follow after the 
ICO, as soon as their development has 
advanced near enough to launch. Our 
research into innovative blockchain and 
distributed AI technologies will continue 
to be a priority, as will our preparation for 
an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the near 
future.

Financial 
Forecasts 2018

Based on the data available to us, 
including valuations of our tech offerings, 
estimated customer base and other 
variables Invacio have calculated revenue 
projections for the business in 2018.

There is a wide spread between our 
conservative forecast and optimistic 
forecast because initial revenue forecasts 
for any new business are always tough to 

accurately predict. For this reason Invacio 
have overall been very conservative in 
order to safeguard us from the risk of 
operational costs outstripping revenues.

These have been extrapolated from the 
following information;

Invacio have also calculated the 
following projected baseline operating 
costs, in line with our most conservative 
revenue forecast for 2018. These 
overheads will allow Invacio to become 
operational and liquid immediately 
that the ICO closes in all working 
capital scenarios. Should more than 

our baseline revenue projections be 
raised, Invacio will be able to increase 
spending, particularly in areas such 
as R&D, M.A.S. AI-infrastructure, and 
product testing.

From these figures, Invacio have also 
estimated the expected working 
capital for 2018, which will be allocated 
according to the needs of the business, 
which are likely to be dominated by 
product development, testing, and 
launch.

Inspired by his work as a border official while attending law school in Canada, David Lesperance 
JD has specialized in tax and immigration issues since being called to the Ontario Bar in 1990, 
where he was an active member for for 26 years prior to establishing his consultancy firm, 
Global Citizenship Group. After his first US citizen expatriation client in 1990, David has been 
particularly focused on the integration of tax, immigration and citizenship for American-based 
clients. Since then he has assisted several hundred US clients to legally and permanently leave 
the US tax system. In addition, by working with their existing trusted advisors, he has assisted 
many other American clients to establish their personal and family “Backup Plans”. Along with

Benjamin is our hardware and database management champion. Having studied finance 
& economics at Imperial College London, in addition to programming (multiple languages), 
electronics & communications, he is without question the most absurdly overqualified grunt in 
history. Despite his extremely valuable experience in global sales and marketing, and his skills 
as a Forex trader, he spends his time playing with cables and tearing insulating tape with his 
teeth. He also spends time:

Constructing our backbone GPU server racks
Overseeing and managing very-large-databases (VLDBs)
Keeping most of Southeast Asia in essential produce with his two transportation companies

Ben manages Invacio’s data retrieval and storage facilities.

Arvind has worked as Invacio’s developer for five years.  His formidable skill set includes his 
mastery of an array of backend/front end programming languages. He is co-founder of NLite 
Web Solutions, is Front End UX Team Lead, and has worked as Senior PHP Developer and 
Senior Website Developer at I-Quall Infotech and Om Web Solutions. He attended Saurashtra 
University in Rajkot, Gujarat, India and is an Invacio architect with a wealth of programming, 
coding PHP development and website development experience. Arvind also just completed 
residency in Canada, where Invacio will base him.

The Invacio team spans five continents, and with certain of us more usefully thought of 
as entropy-generators than human beings, Linleeya’s ability to violate the second law of

Demon is to Brownian motion. She is Invacio’s very own entropy pump. And she is a vital 
part of what has held us together as we launch. Linleeya holds degrees in education and in 
hospitality management, and as we develop she will take responsibility for the management of 
our international events and public appearances.

EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM
Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to 
help others the most?
Rather than just doing what feels right, we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very 
best causes to work on.
But it's no use answering the question unless you act on it. Effective altruism is about following 
through. It's about being generous with your time and your money to do the most good you 
can.

Invacio’s PLEXCOIN COMPENSATION
https://www.prlog.org/12680897-ininvacio-ico-offers-consolation-to-cheated-plx-token-
holders.html

In light of the recent charges filed against PlexCoin by the SEC and the 
freezing of all PlexCoin assets, fintech startup Invacio has pledged to 
compensate the investors burned by the fraudulent ICO.

One of many thousands who invested and lost money in PlexCoin’s ICO, Invacio founder and 
CEO William West has generously offered replacement tokens to all those caught up in the 
PlexCoin scam.

500,000 INV have been set aside for distribution to those wishing to exchange their now 
valueless PLX for Invacio’s own token, which will become available at the launch of the Invacio 
ICO. Every PlexCoin customer will be eligible for a maximum of 100 tokens. No financial 
exchange will be necessary to claim the INV tokens. (By Set Date).

According to Invacio’s vision statement, the company has worked more than five years on a 
technology that applies their ground-breaking machine learning, artificial neural network and 
multi-agent system AI to the world’s most comprehensive catalogue of up to the minute and 
historical data of its kind:

“Our company will also greatly benefit from this offer of compensation as it’s an opportunity for 
us to gather valuable feedback on our signup systems from people who are already familiar with 
cryptocurrency investments. The process will enable us to enter pre-sale having conducted the 
best possible live test of our systems. It’s very unfair how people lost money to PlexCoin, and 
the least Invacio can do is give a little back: to do so is in the spirit of our company’s founding 
principles.”

WeNet and VADGAMA BLOCKCHAIN
Invacio’s Labs is constantly imagining and developing an array of technical solutions. 
WeNet is just one example which we will take the time to go into some detail to allow 
us to convey some sense of the scope of Invacio’s research and development branch.

WeNet is a military grade, secure and free to operate communications network 
framework. It does not require the internet infrastructure, nor does it require a cellular 
network. Instead it uses the ingenious Vadgama Blockchain, which relies on any 
available radio link (or any device capable of transmitting audio to create a stable 
and portable internet gateway in areas with zero internet connectivity; we have even 
made a working prototype which employs light and laser transmissions.) WeNet was 
conceived to provide secure private communication in remote and dense surroundings. 
This is achieved by making use of the availability of low-cost modern radio devices. 
Invacio used this as a starting point to develop new ways in which people can free 
themselves from expensive, commercial, government controlled and heavily surveilled 
infrastructures with the aim of building this functionality into our own end to end 
encrypted communications systems for voice, video and data communications. Proof 
of concept was achieved and testing carried out in the mountains of South Asia, in the 
Indian Ocean, and in the jungles of West Papua. It is a simple and elegant solution with 
boundless applications. 

WeNet has endless real world applications such as:

• Medical teams working in remote areas and under difficult conditions who wish to 
build basic communications infrastructure in order to coordinate efforts such as 
the delivery of medication and food reliably and securely. 

• Disaster response, rescue and medical teams who are working in devastated 
zones without the availability of standard telecommunications infrastructure. 

• Ships who wish to obtain news updates from some approaching coastlines or 
from another ship which has internet access. This may be a simple exchange 
of information about news, weather conditions, provisions etc or crucial data 
transmissions that cannot be easily relayed via traditional methods. This capability 
is once again particularly relevant to disaster response efforts.

• Expedition basecamps who need a simple solution to build a common gateway 
for establishing radio communication and messaging service links with camps, 
remotely located basecamps and/or rescue teams to coordinate tasks such as 
logistics, rescue efforts, routes and schedules. 

• Military applications allowing secure connectivity anywhere in the world.

Many ideas have been posited as we developed this secure communication system.. 
We have experimented with broadcasting UDP packets within mesh network solutions. 
We have experimented with using patched wireless network card drivers to inject 
crafted Wi-Fi management frames. We have also considered crafting TDMA packets 
via cell phone’s inbuilt RF hardware. We considered custom firmware with patched 
drivers. We also thought about a Wi-Fi interconnected cellphone net approach, but 
found the coverage range to be inadequate. We saw others working on different mesh 
related projects and we thought concluded that one solution shouldn't necessarily 
discard another but rather try to complement it. We found huge potential benefits 
during this period of development, but what we also uncovered was just how locked 
down and over-regulated our communication devices are.

As a result of these hurdles, we decided to start thinking even further outside of 
the box. Initially WeNet used code from 'minimodem' and then from 'soundmodem' 
sources but after suggestions from ham radio experts involved in ARES, we decided to 
separate it and to make it modular using Fldigi software, a broadly deployed solution 
for use with ham radios, the premise of this being that workstation, connected to 
radio is controlled by means of XML-RPC calls which can be made even between 
remote systems.

This led to the development of WeNetPacket, a simple protocol packet. This contains 
information to verify that there was no corruption during the transmission and a 
randomly generated code to pseudo-identify the packet. We define the addresses of 
network nodes by their ability to decrypt a given packet. Addresses are derived from 
the hashes of asymmetric encryption keys. Every radio node defines its own address 
by the pair of keys it has generated for itself and the addresses change if users choose 
to regenerate their keys. Each node only cares for what is being received. No hardware 
identification, no transmitter identification. only packets matter. Transmissions are 
anonymous. Whenever an address is needed to reply to a packet, it is encrypted 
inside the packet. Packets targeting specific addresses are encrypted and must be 
decrypted by the private key that only the target possesses. Anyone trying to spoof an 
address will be unable to decrypt the packet. Symmetrical encrypted packets are also 
available, and can be used as an extra layer too. General non-encrypted packets are 
available by default for general broadcasting and community discussion as well as for 
those users in countries where laws forbid encryption on certain radio frequencies.

The current release remit focuses on messaging and can be used as a simplistic 
message board within a LAN network, and to relay communications between radio 
nodes. It has inbuilt internet gateway capabilities which can offer access to social 
networking, news and other media. The gateway can can be used whenever a WeNet 
running station gains a working internet connection and chooses to share it and it’s 
traffic can be anonymized via the Tor network and by using it’s inbuilt proxy support.

Initial release will be a minimal set of useful functions, however now that the 
framework is in place it can easily be built upon. For instance we have already played 
interactive chess games with people 10,000 miles away from a yacht in the Indian 
Ocean, shared pictures, and established encrypted low bandwidth digital voice chats 
and video chats. We have 3D printed over distances of 1000 miles and transmitted 
medical orders at distances in excess of 500 miles. All without phones or internet 
access.

radio transceivers come with many different interfaces. 
Each brand deploys different connectors even within their 
own range of models and sadly there is usually no standard 
which they follow.
We understand that some people have experience using more expensive radio 
equipment and will know how to link those transceivers to their computers and as 
such we focused on supporting the cheapest and most accessible models which 
are able to offer the worldwide democratization of this solution, in even the poorest 
and most remote regions.

We have experimented with cheap vhf/uhf fm handheld transceivers available 
worldwide for as little as as $40. These devices come with a Kenwood 2-pin 
connector composed of a 2.5mm and 3.5mm jack. The 2.5mm jack transports 
the speaker signal whilst the 3.5mm jack serves as the microphone input. We kept 
things very simple by using the VOX function on the transceiver to avoid more 
complex PTT setups.

Of course although this goes into some depth about WeNet it still remains merely 
an outline of the offering as it stands, but still it serves as a fascinating window into 
Invacio’s development operations.
