JET8’s platform allows brands and agencies to target, publish, syndicate 

and track the social life of branded content, transforming the way brands 

and consumers interact.

JET8 - the creator of social currency JETpoints, is now launching the JET8 

Token (J8T) in order to open and scale its ability to reward influencers, 

brands and consumers within the JET8 ecosystem of peer to peer 

engagement, user generated native branded content and IoT connectivity 

to convenience stores, supermarkets and retailers.

With the proceeds of the crowdsale, the JET8 Foundation will open the 

JET8 mobile engagement platform, allowing unlimited stakeholders to 

participate in the ecosystem through scaling the current JETpoints social 

currency for worldwide accessibility.

The influencer marketing industry is expected to grow to a $10 billion 

industry by 2020, and is rated as the fastest-growing customer acquisition 

channel for marketers (1). With more affordable smartphones and an 

under-30 mobile population in dynamic growth (70% of millennial 

consumers reported peer influence of purchases (2) ), JET8 is in a prime 

position for expansion.

Whilst conventional influencer marketing (connecting brands to a database 

of influencers) is 3 x more likely to accelerate referral flow (3),  it is in fact 

peer-to-peer marketing that is the leading driver behind 20-50% of all 

purchasing decisions (4), with 81% of consumers reporting peer influence 

on purchases (5).

Since its launch in 2015, JET8 has become the first company to tokenize 

social influence by allowing top Fortune 500 brands to buy its social 

currency called JETpoints in order to reward influencers for peer to peer 

branded content. In this space, JET8 stands alone in providing the tools 

necessary to connect brands to their audiences, and convert them into 

consumers.

Currently JETpoints are injected into the ecosystem by brands, and JET8’S 

technology rewards users with JETpoints for creating, sharing, liking and 

commenting on content such as brand-supporting selfies. Users then spend 

their JETpoints on products in the JET8 brand ecosystem. Individuals are 

empowered by determining which brands they engage with, when and 

how, whilst brands are granted a more convertible audience, and the 

currency is kept circulating within the ecosystem through direct sales.

With over 4 billion coins already in circulation, and more than 2 million 

branded selfies and videos published, 60 million engagements (likes, 

comments and shares) rewarded and over 15,900+ convenience stores 

already accepting the coin as payment for consumer goods, JET8’s mobile 

engagement platform is fertile ground for growth with the introduction of 

the J8T.

Unilever, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Danone, Nestle, Heinz Company, Avon, 

Friesland Campina, Kimberly Clark, CellC, Watson’s and Pepsico are just few 

of the global brands already using JET8’s social currency to manage 

influencer payment and rewards.

With an average ROI of 260% achieved by brands using JET8’s Co2Co TM 

(Content to Commerce solution), they also enjoy the most complete data 

analytics dashboard in the mobile engagement industry today. Companies 

with formalized referral marketing tools saw 86% more revenue growth 

over the past two years when compared to those that don’t (6) , placing 

JET8 in a prime position to lead this burgeoning industry.

Founded in 2014 in Singapore, JET8 has since established offices in Jakarta, 

Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Barcelona and Cape Town. In the past 18 months, 

JET8’s social applications have allowed over 30+ global brands to engage 

with more than 15 million influencers and reach over 1.8 billion consumers 

through branded selfies and videos. Some of the brands already engaging

JET8’s vision is to scale the JETpoints social currency into the global 

standard for managing relationships between brands, influencers, 

audiences and retailers. In the past 12 months, JET8's API, SDK and 

connected applications have connected over 200 million consumers with 

branded content, and over 3 billion JETpoints have rewarded mobile 

influencers for their user generated peer to peer native branded content.

JET8 boasts a connected ecosystem of offline convenience stores, online 

retailers and other products and services that have transacted more than 

200,000 redemptions of consumer goods in the past 12 months.

JET8’s mission to become the standard solution for interconnected and 

decentralized engagement networks is being accomplished. JET8’s Full 

Stack App, a social media application linked to all major social media 

platforms, is made widely available to all stakeholders in the JET8 

ecosystem.

With the introduction of the J8T token and by taking the numerous features 

of its existing software suite to the masses, JET8 will narrow the gap 

between brands of all sizes, creators of mobile content, and consumers.

The future value of the J8T Token can be seen in JET8’s success in creating 

and managing this functioning ecosystem of tokenized apps and services. 

Integrating the current JET8 activities and transactions onto the blockchain 

will obviously further enhance the transparent and immutable qualities of 

the data it tracks and provides, but more importantly it positions JET8 at the 

first in the industry to be prepared for the GDPR on the 25 May 2018 (7).

Within the JET8 ecosystem, anyone has the opportunity to progress from 

user to influencer, community leader to brand, content producer to media 

channel, and spectator to platform owner.

The J8T Token’s goal is to fuel the expansion of a model in which people 

are the nodes, the centre of creation, influence, and earning potential. 

Retailers, platform owners, the media and the banks can now be part of 

these networks, rather than the centre of it.

Customers acquired from these peer to peer based networks prove to be 

easier for brands to convert, and have a higher lifetime value than a 

customer acquired through paid media. With the increased use of ad 

blockers (over 615 million devices polled had ad blockers installed (8)), 

consumer scepticism of ‘celebrity’ endorsement, and conventional 

influencer marketing proving to be expensive and hard to gauge; 

Peer to Peer marketing succeeds in connecting consumers with messages 

from people they trust, rather than corporations they don’t.

JET8 pioneered the world’s first peer to peer mobile engagement platform 

through the use of branded digital assets, which include stickers, frames 

and themes which users integrate with their own content.

JET8's API is the first technology to recognise the user’s ‘face value’ (the 

value of the selfie), and to allow them to monetise this content creation 

along with their own data.

JET8 offers a range of digital services that streamline a brand’s relationship 

with their community of consumers. These include but are not limited to 

JET8’s Full Stack of customised social mobile applications, Content to 

Commerce Mobile Engagement, Product & Social Sampling, and Data 

Mining programs which will be described in detail in section 5.

The J8T Token will replace JETpoints to give access to these digital services 

and to purchase consumer products and digital goods (such as phone top-

ups, utilities and amenities) using the JET8 Wallets and Shop functions at 

connected offline and online retail outlets such as 7/11, Circle K, ShopRite.

Brands inject funds into the ecosystem, which converts into JETpoints, 

which are attributed to user’s engagement Wallet every time a validated 

engagement such as likes, comments are shares is generated from their 

social networks.

The success of the JET8 system is seen in three significant benefits to 

brands: radically improved ROI’s, the most valuable user data available (on 

JET8’s real-time engagement analytics dashboard); and unprecedented 

engagement results for social media brand campaigns.

The maturity of JET8’s technology is reflected in the JET8 dashboard, an 

admin console giving access to detailed real-time analytics. This data is 

utilised by brands to monitor engagement and campaign success, and to 

accurately gauge demographic responses to branding choices.

For instance, a brand may note a preference of colour usage in the branded 

assets favoured by users, and this data is then used to shape further 

marketing campaigns.

Results for social media campaigns launched through the JET8 platform 

depict the profound increase of reach available for brands due to the 

following:

-  Integration with other social media platforms utilises their reach whilst 

brands retain the benefit of owning, monitoring, and tracking campaign 

content. The viral effect of this has generated earned media over 150% (on 

average) of paid media.

-  The design and use of branded assets encourages user interaction from 

the most active online demographic of 18-34 year olds.

-  As users experience a transparent and reciprocal relationship of value, 

their engagement and that of their communities organically increases.

- Results in the creation of niche communities is of high value to brands, as 

54% of people believe the smaller the community, the bigger the 

influence.

Brands inject funds into the ecosystem, which converts into JETpoints, 

which are attributed to user’s engagement Wallet every time a validated 

engagement such as likes, comments are shares is generated from their 

social networks.

The J8T Token will provide immediate access to liquidity options within the 

JET8 ecosystem. In the same way that digital services can currently be 

purchased with fiat currency within the ecosystem, they can be purchased 

with J8T Tokens at a preferred rate (10-20% bonus).

Based on the current rate of expansion of the service providers, brands and 

retailers accepting JETpoints both on and offline, and with the inclusion of 

donations, payment for amenities, utilities and any other product or service 

over time, J8T owners can expect continued growth and expansion of their 

liquidity options.

The JETpoints system functionality proves the feasibility and JET8’s 

competency in successfully integrating the J8T Token and a number of 

operational elements onto the blockchain in the form of smart contracts.

To depict the functionality of the technology and its potential to fuel 

network growth, JET8 has created a bespoke Bounty Program utilising the 

Full Stack App. Influencers engaged in the Program will each be provided 

with their own app with which to engage their communities with the J8T

Influencers will be rewarded in tokens for the engagement they encourage,

The app design can be fully customized through the app dashboard, 

including colour specification, icon choice, and strings, among other 

options. Once the app is customized by the client, it will be released to 

Google Play and the App Store.

The technical specifications of the app are directly managed by the JET8 

dashboard, enabling the client to focus on marketing and app community 

growth.

App owner incentives

-  Content created within the app is tagged in perpetuity by JET8’s API 

(transitioning to smart contracts).

-  The app owner also earns half a J8T Token for every J8T earned by the 

user from a post featuring a third party asset.

-  J8T Tokens can buy individual app owners engagement the same way 

brands do with JET8 branded assets and other digital services.

-  As a community grows, an influencer can transform into a brand, as 

influencers effectively become miners for J8T Tokens.

-  JET8 offers Influencers with 1 million followers or more a free app of their 

own, and by paying with J8T Tokens, brands will receive a 10% discount on 

their own app.

-  Brands benefit from this system with a minimum injection of $30,000 into 

the JET8 ecosystem.

User incentives

-  The app provides a space in which data and content ownership are 

transparent and, with integration onto the blockchain, are immutable.

-  Users are rewarded for Influencer asset usage and engagement in 

JETpoints.

-  Users are rewarded for 3rd party asset engagement as well.

-  The app is a niche community, valuable for its focused information and 

communications. These communications can be topic or brand related, and 

consumer directed.

-  Users have direct access to products made available by both the app 

owner and the brands they support, which can be redeemed via the JET8 

Wallet.

High earners of JETpoints gain the status of Influencer in the JET8 

ecosystem. The Bounty Program for JET8 is a prime example of how an 

Influencer can use the FSA.

Posts shared to other platforms spread the Influencer’s reach and attract 

even more users back to their own app, and in this example, to the JET8 

ecosystem.

On the user friendly dashboard, the Influencer can modify app visuals, 

choose the stickers and frames they make available, and whether to make 

third party brand assets available. Dashboard and Shop technical aspects 

are all managed within the software.

When users create Influencer branded posts and encourage engagement 

both within the app and on external social networks, the Influencer’s status 

grows, as does their community.

Thus the Influencer becomes a Brand in their own right.

User rewards are stored in their Wallet, and can be used to redeem 

products from the Influencer’s collection, or any product or service available 

through the interconnected apps of the JET8 ecosystem.

Streamlining sales and marketing efforts with Co2Co technology fosters 

demand, as consumers become an intrinsic part of the brand ecosystem.

Brands have found significant growth in their ROI’s by engaging their 

communities using JET8’s Co2Co technology as capacity for direct sales to 

users is boosted and consumer engagement is more relevant than ever.

Branded Asset Collections (BACs) used in Co2Co campaigns come in the 

form of Geo-stickers and Geo-frames. These are used in the creation of 

daily moments (selfies, pictures and videos) by users and published to 

multiple social media platforms simultaneously.

The landscape of digital advertising is shifting as consumers demand more 

genuine and reciprocal engagement from brands. Native advertising and 

contextual ads demonstrate the value of communities of assured interest, as 

the most optimal client is one who connects with your brand’s values and 

voice. Specifically targeting, communicating with and selling to these 

clients (rather than casting your net wide) is achieved with Content to 

Commerce technology.

Delivered samples, retail store giveaways and other formats traditionally 

convert only 3-5% of sampled communities. With digital sampling you can 

target, customise and convert through a smart data dashboard, monitoring 

the discovery, acceptance and redemption of a sampled product.

JET8’s Product Sampling Campaigns works through the distribution of 

currency cards that can be used to redeem specific products online or at 

physical retail stores (convenience stores, large surfaces, specialty Shops or 

chains).

JET8’s Product Sampling Campaign technology (PSCs) is a boon for the 

industry, as thousands or millions of consumers can be reached with user-

friendly technology.

The leading tenet of JET8 is to allow users to decide whether or not to 

share their user data with third parties. JET8’s network does not allow 

transfer of data to any of the ends of the value chain without explicit 

permission. This system allows for a free flow of value as long as both 

parties agree to the transaction.

Users are prompted in-app to choose whether or not to share personal 

data, and receive a currency reward if they do.

The user is offered a full description of the data they agree to share.

Only when a user agrees, with the click of a button, does this interaction 

take place.

Branded Asset Collections are the heart of the JET8 ecosystem. In real-time, 

brands monitor BAC usage and collect precise and detailed data, including 

what assets are used, when, where, by whom and for what purpose.

BAC content is shared across multiple social media networks, resulting in 

massive scalability for the brand, as users are now creating and sharing, 

rather than simply receiving.

Brands are able to synchronise their marketing and engagement efforts 

through the data available, while simultaneously creating a means for user 

engagement with the brand.

The following services apply to a range of use cases and can be tailored 

and utilised separately depending on requirements.

As one of the first O2O (online to offline) connected marketplaces, JET8 

enables users to redeem consumer goods at physical points of sale with 

their tokens.

Like Alipay or Applepay using the in-app redemption system is a simple 

code-scan, with the currency being withdrawn from the user’s Wallet.

The wide acceptance of the JETpoints by multiple international CVS chains 

and major retailers is one of the most valuable features for brands and users 

in the JET8 ecosystem.

Every day, new retailers and partners are integrating this payment feature 

into the array of accepted methods in thousands of stores worldwide.

The ability to redeem primary-needs items such as food further entrenches 

the immediate value of the technology.

The widescale adoption of J8T Token as an accepted online payment 

method is assured with the JET8 utility apps integration feature.

Based on the upward trend of brand uptake of this technology, JET8 

expects dozens of new partners to start accepting JET8 Wallet payments 

over the next few months.

This scenario complements the current growth of retail and CVS chains that 

make JET8 one of the most powerful networks of liquidity for J8T Token 

owners.

In a digital age, we are still operating within an economic mindset that 

mimics the brick and mortar values and procedures of the past. Much like 

the glaring roadside billboard, banner ads invade our screens, demanding 

our attention. This uni-directional assault on our senses is the result of 

targeting based on data acquired often without our knowledge or explicit 

consent.

Brands spend vast sums to place themselves in front of an audience who, 

despite their algorithmically-determined interest, have not in fact invited 

that brand into their lives. In this system, centralised social media platforms 

act as a well-paid middleman, harvesting and selling data. They offer a 

means to communicate but control interactions. Users, the people who 

create the value of these platforms, are charged instead of being rewarded, 

as are the brands vying for their attention.

These platforms have oversaturated our lives with information to such a 

degree that brands and individuals alike are now demanding niche 

communities of relevant, multi-directional sharing of valuable content. The 

power dynamic is shifting. With the birth of social influencing, it is the 

public that now holds the power to create and circulate the most valuable 

content available; curated, authentic, and consensual.

Influence and creativity are the main drivers of wealth in the era of 

enhanced and artificial intelligence, automation and robotics. JET8 offers 

the tools to earn and manage this wealth by recognising the value of the

This is simply the first step in creating an egalitarian opportunity for wealth 

creation and an alternative economic model that allows anyone, anywhere, 

to become earners and consumers within decentralised engagement 

networks.

JET8 provides proven systems and the technology to fulfil the principle of 

access to wealth creation and consumer opportunities for all. This 

represents both a major disruption of the current economic model, 

democratising earning potential by rewarding both data and content 

contributions; and a major disruption to the way brands and consumers 

interact, changing forever the way we approach marketing, advertising, 

branding, and sales.

Through digital services such as the Influencer-led Bounty Program, JET8 

platform growth will result in increased liquidity options of the J8T Token.

JET8 has consistently focused attention on enabling a shift in the 

relationship between brands and consumers, disrupting the existing 

dynamic of media dominance towards the empowerment of the user as 

creators of content and contributors of data. JET8 has thus created and 

implemented systems to allow brands to have meaningful relationships 

with their community, and the technology to convert them into consumers.

Through the creation of a robust mobile engagement and analytics 

platform being utilised by leading multinational brands, JET8 has firmly 

established its position as a game-changer for peer to peer influence, 

media and consumer relationships. The speed of uptake and the success of 

the JETpoints reward system illustrates JET8 readiness for integration of the 

J8T Token within its ecosystem.
