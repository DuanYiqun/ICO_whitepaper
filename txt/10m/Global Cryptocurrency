PROBLEMS
WE SOLVE

5 BILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT BANKING
SERVICES

A certain number of modern banks have already integrated 
provision of their services on the Internet. They created Internet 
banking, developed applications for customers to access their 
financial means. And this is right. As of the end of last year, 3.5 
billion people had access to the Internet. 

And most of them live in developing countries. However, almost 5 billion people are cut off from the 
global financial system, while the rest of the world takes its existence for granted. Imagine how many 
people still do not have current accounts, bank cards, and deposits. 

First of all, this is due to the reluctance of common banks to be present in the areas, where these 
people live. Access to the Internet is a tool to solve this problem. And our Global Crypto Bank will 
provide these people with access to superior banking services: money transfers, remote payments for 
goods and services, currency exchange, and much more.

The activity of our bank will have no boundaries. It will be a 
modern bank that will become global from the first day. We 
are not trying to  create a centralized market and do not 
violate the ideology of cryptocurrencies, namely and its 
decentralization. We create procedures and tools for 
convenient and safe application of cryptocurrencies.

PROBLEMS
WE SOLVE

BANKING SERVICES ARE EXPENSIVE

At the moment, investors who invest their money 
in cryptocurrencies experience the same 
problem: great difficulties with exchange of it for 
conventional currencies in order to purchase 
goods and services. We create our own payment 
system with a bank card, which will be accepted 
by all ATMs and POS terminals of the world 
working with MasterCard and VISA systems.

An additional bonus for the free account balance will 
be added for every customer daily. We will also 
offer additional quarterly and annual bonuses for 
depositing of funds of our customers.

We will also offer additional 
quarterly and annual bonuses for 

depositing of funds of our customers

These are millions of stores, restaurants, cafes, and various companies around the world. At the same 
time, sellers will be able to reduce their transaction costs. They will be able to provide additional 
discounts to customers. And, unlike payments with cash or classic plastic cards, settlements in our 
payment system will be more convenient and advantageous.

CONCEPT

UNIQUENESS

Our settlement system and payment card will 
reduce costs to 0.5 percents and make the 
settlement system independent. We will service 
the payment gateway and provide acquiring 
services for our plastic cards. This will also 
affect savings of customers (buyers of goods 
and services).

In case of working with conventional payment 
systems, such as MasterCard and VISA, financial 
institutions must receive a MasterCard and VISA 
license and conclude a contract with the bank 
providing acquiring services, and the card issuer. 
Every transaction with a plastic card made by the 
seller brings him the amount which is written off 
from the account of the customer owning the card, 
net of 1 to 3 percent of the transaction amount. 
Thus, the cost of mutual settlement makes up to 3 
percents, and this leads to economic loss of the 
seller burdening the buyer.

PROJECT
DETAILS

BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT
The modern crypto-industry is changing rapidly and is being introduced into a real life and economy. 
Thanks to modern technologies and blockchain, millions of people around the world and hundreds of 
thousands of companies will soon be involved in crypto-economy, and this process can not be stopped. 

The world is in dire need, 
the need for integration 
of cryptoeconomy with

a classic financial
infrastructure

More than ever, the world needs to integrate 
crypto-economy into the conventional financial 
infrastructure. And the Global Crypto Bank project was 
developed to meet all these claims. Development of 
the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) 
became a source for formation of the whole 
crypto-industry. 

It became clear that modern technologies make it possible to secure and protect owners of modern 
cryptocurrency from counterfeiting and theft.  And predictably, the financial sector of the global 
economy began integrating with modern technologies, including blockchain. All this is due to the 
complex data encryption algorithms. 

This integration was called FinTech – a combination of finance 
and technology. This process facilitates provision of banking 
services to the public and business. Moreover, the fact that 
cryptocurrencies are not connected with state regulation and 
conventional currencies ensures their rapid development. 

FinTech – a combination
of finance and technology

The crypto-currency market has emerged and is rapidly developing beneath our eyes. So it is no wonder 
that the initial investing market was also integrated with cryptocurrencies. ICO (initial coin offering) is 
attraction of investments to technological start-ups by offering cryptocurrency to investors which 
becomes more and more popular every day.

12



DETAILS

Projects not related to the IT market – fashion houses, agricultural enterprises, factories, investment 
funds, and, most importantly, new banking institutions such as our Global Crypto Bank join it. It is 
expected that by the end of this year, capitalization of cryptocurrency market will be $200 billion. We 
are creating the international crypto-bank to ensure the turnover of such large amounts and solve the 
associated problems.

 It is expected that by the end
of this year, capitalization

of cryptocurrency
market will be $200 billion. 

We are creating the international
crypto-bank to ensure the

turnover of such large amounts
and solve the associated

problems

We open the initial public offer. However, for 
reliable protection of our investors, we decided 
to do this in the form of the initial coin (token) 
offering. This decision is caused by the fact that 
attracting investments to ICO is much easier 
compared to conventional fundraising methods. 
And it ensures rapid project development.

Earlier we held a private round of investments 
at the rate of 150,000 US dollars. Now, in 
October 2017, we are starting Pre-ICO. 

In December 2017, the ICO project will be started. Our tokens will enter well-known cryptocurrency 
exchanges to support our investors. They will decide for themselves whether to keep tokens in their own 
property to receive dividends (distributed profits), trade it at the exchange, or just sell and receive 
conventional currency.

At the end of every fiscal year, Global Crypto Bank will distribute 50 percent of profits between our 
shareholders. Thus, we will support our cryptocurrency and our investors by our profits. Thus, it will be 
popularized and grow in price (exchange value) at cryptocurrency exchanges.

THE MAIN EXPENSES OF
THE CLASSIC BANK AND OUR GCB

There is a very strong competition in the classic 
banking sector for attracting of new customers, 
which entails significant costs. In a case of 
undeveloped stock market, you can reduce your 
expenses of the real budget up to 5 times  to attract 
the same number of customers.

GROWTH POTENTIAL OF OUR BANK
At the moment, the conventional banking system has a serious competitor 
- crypto-economics. It all began with  introduction of the Internet in our
lives. People got a lot of information. Now, they can choose the most
profitable services very quickly. Banks made a  concession and introduced
Internet banking. According to statistics, to date, about 96% of all banking
customers use mobile banking, call centers, and ATMs. Many customers
do not need classical bank branches anymore. Our company follows this
way as well. We will be only one click away from our customers – one
click for launching our app on a smartphone.

Most FinTech experts agree that the entire world economy will be based 
on blockchain technologies in 10 years. Therefore, we need to build a 
high-tech blockchain-based ecosystem of banking services right  now. 
And we are pioneers in this field.

WHAT IS A TOKEN?
A token is a digital item that facilitates user identification. That is, tokens ensure information security 
on the Internet. That’s why tokens are used in the cryptocurrency environment as an internal payment 
unit. All modern conventional currencies of the world have centralized control.

A token is a digital item
that facilitates user

identification

Everybody knows institutions, like the Federal 
Reserve System and the European Central Bank. 
They are responsible for two major world 
currencies: US dollar and Euro. By monitoring the 
demand for their currencies, these institutions 
regulate the global situation by issuing new money.

Printed money is usually used to finance government expenses. 
There is a full centralization of conventional currencies. 
Cryptocurrencies are absolutely decentralized assets in this 
respect. They always have a limited circulation stipulated in 
advance. It ensures high demand for these cryptocurrencies.

Development of the cryptocurrency market is very rapid. The first 
cryptocurrency – Bitcoin – was issued in 2009. 

Cryptocurrencies
are fully decentralized
assets in this respect

And by the end of this year, experts predict an increase in the volume of the cryptocurrency
market to 200 billion US dollars. The market has  already many various
cryptocurrencies: bitcoins, ethereum, lightcoins, etc.

WHAT IS TOKEN TRADING?

Token trading is the process of bringing a new token to the market by any company to raise funds for its 
own development. This process is always initial in relation to the common exchange of tokens at 
exchanges. 

Token selling is the
 main type of monetization

of the services provided in a free
blockchain network

When tokens are sold, they are initially offered in the 
market, which is usually accompanied by additional 
bonuses to attract demand by encouragement of 
employee, limited “bounties” for the very first 
investors, etc.

Token selling is the main type of monetization of services provided in a free blockchain network. Any 
Internet user can have access to investments in tokens. However, he can be limited in  financial 
resources. ICO enables anyone to become a "shareholder". After all, it is much easier to dispose of a 
single “share” (token) of such companies. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges. At these websites, 
you can exchange any amount of cryptocurrency (tokens) for other cryptocurrencies, conventional 
global currencies, and e-money. Token issue through its sale allows us to attract investors from all over 
the world. 

Token issue through
its sale allows us to attract

investors from all over
the world

These investors will have access to the token once it is 
issued. Token trading will be available in the well-known 
stock exchanges of the world soon. And then a universal 
token trading ecosystem will be formed  and integrated 
with the conventional financial system.

DETAILS

All holders of the plastic 
card of our Global Crypto 

Bank will receive additional 
bonuses from the sellers of 

goods and services

PROFITABLE TOKEN EXCHANGE
All holders of the plastic card of our Global Crypto Bank will 
receive additional bonuses from the sellers of goods and 
services. Since they will be exempt from high transaction costs, 
these funds will be used as incentives for the customers. Every 
paying in POS-terminals with our card will bring you a discount. 
These incentives will increase the demand for payment systems 
of this kind.

WHY DID WE CHOOSE ICO?
Many people believe that ICO is a more risky investment tool than standard IPO methods. Initial coin 
offering occurs at the stage of the concept implementation, when the startup still has rather low cost.  

However, due to the limited number of tokens issued, the value of the acquired share may increase 
many times over a short period of time. The ICO site for investing can be accessed by any Internet user 
from anywhere in the world. 

Thus, we increase the scope of attracting our potential 
customers significantly. At the final stage, we will have 
a huge community of customers who will directly 
influence the future growth and development of our 
bank. 

This is the advantage of ICO over standard venture 
financing.

Our cryptocurrency will become an alternative currency accepted for exchange worldwide. That is, the 
token holders will not be limited in their rights to purchase goods and services anywhere in the world. 
At the same time, tokens will constantly grow in price due to the extension of the ecosystem without 
increase in cryptocurrency supply.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN

The second stage of the first crypto-bank development will be connection to 
SWIFT system and obtaining our own BIC/SWIFT code. The correspondent 
account is required for connection to SEPA and use of MT1xx and MT2xx format, 
as well as for membership in MasterCard/VISA for issue of our own plastic 
cards.

Investor funds raised during ICO will be used by a legal entity to obtain a Swiss 
payment institution license in accordance with the requirements and laws on 
payment institutions and e-money institutions. This is the first stage of our 
crypto-bank development. The financial inspection of Switzerland will supervise 
our activities. Audit control will be conducted with legally regulated schedule by 
international audit bureaus.
After receiving the license, Global Crypto Bank will be able to open an account 
with an international bank with min. A+ rating. This will ensure reliable security 
of funds.

The next stage will be cration of our own  plastic card with the use of blockchain 
technology with international financial standards. And it will not depend on 
MasterCard and VISA payment systems, but will be independent payment 
system for maximal reduction of transaction costs.
