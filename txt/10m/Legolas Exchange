Abstract 
 

�e crypto community has been plagued by  opa�ue and unprincipled exchanges .  

Improving and strengthening these fundamental links within the community must be front 
and center. 

With cryptocurrencies emerging as a legitimate asset class,  �nancial institutions  are 
working on  entering this growing market , but they currently lack the tools to make large 
investments that remain in line with their security and transparency needs.  

Within this context,  Legolas Exchange  is committed to creating a  trustworthy, 
demonstrably fair  and  bank-backed premium protocol  where traders and investors, small 
and large, can transact without doubting the integrity and robustness of the platform or its 
order management system. 

Legolas Exchange’s protocol  incorporates a decentralized ledger  within its proprietary 
centralized platform in order to neutralize front-running, guarantee the inalterability, 
temporality and transparency of the order book, and ensure a fair trading environment. 
Led by an experienced team of �nanciers and successful entrepreneurs, Legolas Exchange 
has partnered with global brokerage �rm Makor Capital. Makor operates a broker dealer 
business trading under 2 brand names, Makor Securities London Limited,  regulated by the 
FCA , and Oscar Gruss and Son Inc,  regulated by FINRA  and the NFA. Makor will 
provide Legolas Exchange customers with  custody of their deposits at major banks , and 
access to  hundreds of �nancial institutions already onboarded . 

Legolas Exchange aspires to become the reference in terms of security and compliance for 
all crypto exchanges.

1. Shortfalls of Existing Exchanges 
Existing crypto exchanges present numerous important �aws and limitations. 

With no alternatives, the community is forced to accept opacity, capped or slow 
transactions, and the risk of catastrophic losses. 

Institutional investors who cannot overlook these concerns are locked out of the market 
and the trillions of dollars it represents.  

1.1 Lack of Security 

1.1.1 Bitcoin �e� 

Millions of bitcoins have been stolen from crypto exchanges since Bitcoin’s creation. 
Lacking guarantees and insurance, hacked crypto exchanges decline responsibility for 
stolen bitcoins. An example of this is the Mt. Gox case in which the company said it had 
lost almost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins and around 100,000 of its own bitcoins, 
totaling around 7% of all bitcoins, worth around $473 million at the time. Mt. Gox released 
a statement stating that, "the company believes there is a high possibility that the bitcoins 
were stolen,” blamed hackers, and began a search for the missing bitcoins. Chief Executive 
Karpelès said technical issues le� an opening for fraudulent withdrawals. A�er he was 
interrogated, Japanese prosecutors accused him of misappropriating Y315m ($2.6m) in 
bitcoins deposited into trading accounts by investors at Mt. Gox and moving it into an 
account he controlled approximately six months before Mt. Gox failed in early 2014. 

�is case is only one of the most well documented, and there have been numerous other 
situations where crypto assets deposited at exchanges were lost or stolen. A signi�cant risk 
still exists today, and it is widely agreed that due to complacency and a lack of better 
alternatives all major exchanges currently lack the proper security to ade�uately protect 
customers’ deposits. 

1.1.2 Weak Authentication 

Existing exchanges operate in a login/password paradigm. Even though some “veri�ed 
account” solutions exist, many traders have faced locked accounts, credential problems and 
even incorrect balances on their account. Furthermore, most �nancial institutions are set 
up in such a way that money managers serve as investment advisors to their investors and 
are re�uired to follow dual signature rules whereby administrator are signatory to all 

5 



 

 

outside transactions. Existing 2 factor authorization policies are a step in the right 
direction but do not satisfy institutional compliance and security needs. 

1.1.3 No Deposit Security or Recourse 

An obvious drawback to most existing exchanges is that they create their own rules and 
re�uire a large degree of trust from investors and traders.  

Running contrary to many principles of “trust-less” applications, traders who deposit 
cryptocurrencies and digital assets on exchanges may have no recourse should the 
exchanges choose to change the rules, keep some bitcoins locked for one reason or another, 
or even disappear altogether.  

Additionally, communicating and resolving disputes with exchanges when the residence of 
the holding company is in an unreachable tax haven can be unnecessarily di�cult. 

1.4 Large Fiat Transactions Are Laborious 

�ere are only a handful of crypto exchanges in the world that accept real �at deposits and 
withdrawals, and all of them have some or all of the following attributes: lengthy 
onboarding process, high fees, and delays of up to a week for buying bitcoins with �at (in 
conjunction with an unknown and sometimes evidently unfair execution price). Fiat 
transactions are  also constrained to a certain amount, ranging from a few thousands to a 
few tens of thousands of dollars, per 24-hour period.  

In addition to these problems, withdrawing �ats to a bank account from a crypto exchange 
is also challenging with most banks and �nancial institution �uestioning the wires, o�en 
rejecting them and even closing customers’ bank accounts.  

�ese limits are an obstacle to many large investors and traders who are looking to move 
hundreds of thousands or millions in a short amount of time.  

1.2 Price Manipulation 

1.2.1 What is Front Running? 

Front running is the unethical practice of a broker trading an e�uity in his personal 
account based on advanced knowledge of pending orders from the brokerage �rm or from 
clients, thus allowing him to pro�t from the knowledge. In other words, front running is a 
practice that consists in placing orders before someone else does based on advanced 
knowledge of their transaction. 

FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) regulates front running within the 

6 



 

 

traditional �nancial market but such regulations remain insu�cient when it comes to 

protecting holders. �e concept of “no evil seen, no evil done” hinders any possibility of 
action. Moreover these rules and regulations are di�cult to keep up to date with the fast 

paced, constantly evolving technology. FINRA’s latest 5270 rule, which addresses 

front-running block transactions, took 4 years to implement. 

�e 2016 HSBC scandal, among others, is only the tip of the iceberg and proves that the 
only e�cient means of prevention lies in technologies making such practices impossible. 

Legolas Exchange’s  protocol provides  the technological means to combat front-running of 
block transactions. It is absolutely necessary and is the optimal way to achieve 
transparency in cryptocurrency trading and, on a larger scale, the whole �nancial 
ecosystem. 

1.2.2 Crypto Exchanges and Front Running 

Crypto exchanges are best positioned to pro�t from front-running practices: they can 
insert their own buy order before a trader’s large buy order and sell the bought asset right 
a�er the trader’s order is executed. 

�e trader winds up paying more for his purchase and the exchange has pocketed a 
substantial pro�t pi�ybacking o� the trader. Large order dark pools, like the one 
proposed by Kraken Exchange, are particularly exposed to front running. 

Forums like Reddit, Bitcointalk and Steemit show hundreds of instances of users of crypto 
exchanges complaining about suspected front running. Even though the allegations are 
impossible to prove because of the complete opa�ueness of the order book, the mere 
possibility is a large deterrent for large and sophisticated investors.  

1.2.3 No Transparent Price Formation 

�e issues mentioned above are major obstacles to transparent price evaluation and, 
conse�uently, to the creation of �nancial products like ETF. 

On March 10, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission denied a re�uest to list 
what would have been the �rst U.S. exchange-traded fund built to track Bitcoin. In its 
statement, the SEC stated, "the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change 
because it does not �nd the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange 
Act, which re�uires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect 
investors and the public interest." In other words, the commission found that the proposed 
fund was too susceptible to fraud.

In their report on virtual currencies, the EBA (European Banking Authority) listed a 
detailed number of possible regulatory responses to the challenges posed by virtual 

currencies. One of the main proposals is: “Transparent price formation and re�uirements 
against market abuse. To avoid market manipulation and insider trading, intermediaries 
must comply with existing regulation against such practices in the �nancial sector.” 

It is crucial for modern exchanges to un�uestionably prove that they cannot 

practice market manipulation. With its hybrid protocol, Legolas  Exchange  provides an 
elegant solution to this important issue. 

1.3 Lack of Transparency 

Most crypto exchanges don't provide any reports and are never audited by independent 
authorities. Moreover, the �nancial audit process has traditionally been opa�ue, operating 
in a black box environment with only a pass or fail judgement rendered by the auditor on 
an annual basis. A number of initiatives are underway internationally aiming  to increase 

transparency of the audit process. However, Legolas  Exchange  believes that the only 
e�cient means of reporting rests with technologies making every exchanges operation 
traceable in a public blockchain. 

1.4 Latency Problem 

Di�erences in connection �uality can also make trading unfair in existing exchanges: trader 
bots with good connections can see order books more �uickly and can, therefore, react 
appropriately more �uickly. In doing so,  they gain an unfair edge over most exchange 
users. �e problem is particularly acute during rallies when exchange throughput limits are 
reached.   As a result of the uneven playing �eld created by low latency traders, institutional 
investors may choose or be forced to avoid investing in certain parts of the market because 
they cannot receive the guarantees they need for fair and transparent price discovery and 
execution. 

2. Legolas Exchange’s Solution 
Legolas’s mission is to create a fair and ideal environment for institutional investors and 
other large investors to manage and invest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. To this 
end, Legolas Exchange uses novel blockchain-based technology to guarantee fairness and 
transparency of the order book. �e security, as well as auditing, reporting and analytical 
needs are met in the safest and most e�cient way.

Additionally, thanks to its partnership with the regulated �rm Makor Securities, Legolas 
will be able to o�er �at custody solutions for clients at major banks. 

 

2.1 Security measures 

2.1.1 �e� Proof Wallets and Features 

Legolas will leverage its partnerships with Makor Securities, Oscar Gruss and Ledger to 
provide the following security features: 

Custody of clients’ �at deposits:  A regulated broker, Makor has existing custodian 
relationships with most global banks such as Merrill Lynch. Legolas and Makor will 
custody Legolas Exchange clients at a major global bank.  

Advanced multisig and secure terminals : Optional features based on multi-signature will 
be available to control active and cold storage. We will work with several Hardware Wallets 
and hardware manufacturers to o�er optional secure terminals/displays to validate orders.  

Segregated custody of cryptocurrencies : Dedicated HSM storage will be available as an 
optional service for clients. 
Authentication : Simple login+password access type will not be allowed on Legolas. Legolas 
will enforce secure 2FA protection with FIDO U2F  support or client certi�cates . By 1 2

default, weak 2FA like OTP/Google Authenticator/Authy/SMS won’t be authorized or will 
be only temporarily tolerated, since these methods are vulnerable to phishing attacks . 3

Active storage and cold storage :  �ese are guaranteed by di�erent certi�ed HSM 
(Hardware Security Module), thanks to our partnership with Ledger . 4

Legolas Exchange clients will be given a key on a 2 of 3 multisig wallet, along with Legolas 
Exchange and a Trusted �ird Party. �e key given to the third party will be stored in a 
Ledger cold wallet, itself stored in a bank safe. Should the client lose her key, the stored key 
will be retrieved from the bank, ensuring complete security of the funds.  

Tailor-made solutions:  For customers with special re�uirements imposed by law or by 
pre-existing processes, Legolas will build  dedicated access control. 

Secure Web services : Highly available, redundant, customized DDoS shielded hosting 
solution with network and application levels �rewalls.   Legolas will use secure H�P 
headers like HSTS to enforce TLS encryption, CSP & X�XSS�P to avoid/mitigate XSS

attacks, X�Frame-Options to forbid clickjacking, etc. Passwords are salted and hashed . 5

Secure company policies : Strict role-based and attributes-based access control rules. No 
all-in-one-person privileged accounts. No direct access to assets (private keys are securely 
stored in HSM inside securely guarded and distributed hosting provider facilities).  

Security audits and certi�cations : Unbiased zero-knowledge orders encryption is done 
through keys provided by CertEurope  PKI-on-blockchain services. We are planning to 6

pass regular external audits and to obtain security certi�cations delivered by ANSSI . 7

2.1.2 Large Fiat, Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals 

Legolas  Exchange’s  clients will be able to deposit and withdraw both �at currencies and 
cryptocurrencies. Legolas  Exchange  and Makor will create a reliable, scalable and secure 
deposit and withdrawal system. 

�e option to convert �at currencies into crypto currencies, and reciprocally, in large 
�uantities will be a game changer for the community and a gateway to unleashing vast new 
in�ows.  

2.2 Blockchain Technology on top of the Centralized Exchange 

2.2.1 Front-running Proof 

Legolas Exchange’s protocol uses blockchain properties to determine the position of a given 
order in the order �ueue. To achieve this, a user’s order is �rst encrypted and then sent to 
the blockchain. Once a block is con�rmed, the order se�uence is engraved into the 
blockchain. At this point, it becomes impossible to insert an order into the order �ueue, 
and the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the order is published 
in the blockchain. �us, temporality of the orders is strictly respected and the possibility of 
front running is neutralized. Legolas Exchange is the �rst demonstrably fair exchange and 
is wholly in compliance with �nancial standards regarding transparency.  

2.2.2 Traceability and Auditability 

In addition, all operations done on  Legolas Exchange  - orders, transactions, withdrawals 
and deposits - are engraved in the blockchain.  Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals 
are recorded in their respective blockchain. �anks to  our privileged partnership with 
Makor, all �at deposits and withdrawals are communicated to and from Makor using  the 

5 Salted Password hashing, doing it right:  https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm

Bitcoin blockchain in addition to being recorded in Makor’s existing book and records. 
Legolas Exchange’s platform is designed to be completely auditable by regulators and can 
provide proof of reserve and audit reports in real time. 

2.2.3 Latency: A Level Playing Field for All Market Participants 

�e very short delay necessary for validating a block can be perceived, at �rst, as a 
limitation when in fact it adds fairness to the trading process. Indeed, a block behaves like 
a pool, randomly ordering all transactions done during the validation time. �erefore, 
traders using a fast internet connection or those who are closer to the exchange data center 
don’t have an advantage over traders with slower connections or who are located farther 
away. �e race against the clock is mainly used to practice front running. It becomes less 
relevant on  Legolas Exchange , where it is neutralized. However Legolas Exchange’s 
platform is blockchain agnostic and, beyond classic networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it 
can be plu�ed into the latest blockchains, reaching several hundred thousand transactions 
per seconds (block.one, Assembly...).

3. Legolas Technology 

3.1 Protocol 

 

�e Legolas Protocol is a semi decentralized order matching protocol. 

Incoming orders and transactions are encrypted, timestamped and stored in a blockchain, 
while order matching is made o�-chain.  

�e decentralization of orders and transactions information allows for transparent price 
formation, transaction auditability, and zero front-running. Centralization of order 
pooling and order matching leads to e�ciency and scalability, bypassing current 
blockchain limitations. 

3.1.1 Work�ow overview  

 

 

12 



 

 

3.1.2 Overview of Components  

 

1) In each batch, the independent and certi�ed PKI publishes a public key and a 
private key in the blockchain. �e public key can be used by anyone to encrypt and 
publish data in the next batch. �e private key can be used by anyone to decrypt 
the data published in the previous batch. 

2) Trader retrieves the public key for the next batch from the blockchain. 
3) Trader encrypts his order and a random number with public key and sends the 

encrypted order to the Order Pool. Orders in the Order Pool are encrypted and are 
ordered by timestamp, which makes front running impossible as price and volume 
information are not made available to the Exchange.  

4) All encrypted orders in the Order Pool are hashed and published in the blockchain. 

 

Once a block is con�rmed: 

 

5) Order �ueue Engine retrieves the private key for the previous batch from the 
blockchain. 

6) Order �ueue Engine asks the Order Pool for all encrypted orders corresponding to 
the hash published in the blockchain in step 4. 

13 



 

 

7) Order �ueue Engine randomly sorts encrypted orders in the following manner: 
each encrypted order is concatenated with the block’s hash and hashed. �e 
resulting hashes are sorted alphabetically. Once orders are se�uenced, Order �ueue 
Engine decrypts them and sends them to Matching Engine and Backend. 

8) Matching Engine sends completed trades to Backend. In addition, trade logs are 
sent to the Blockchain where they are safely stored.  

9) User Interface communicates with Backend to display order books, latest trades, 
and all other relevant information. 

3.1.3 High �roughput 

Each block on a blockchain is able to contain a limited amount of information, which 
currently creates limitations and bottlenecks as soon as the activity on the platform grows 
beyond network capacity. Blockchain’s low throughput is therefore a major obstacle for 
trading because delaying a client’s order due to technological limitations is unacceptable. 
Legolas Exchange solves this problem via an Order Pool system: instead of sending orders 
to the blockchain one at a time, the Order Pool sends a hash of all encrypted orders to the 
blockchain. �is way a single hash code is sent to every block, and an unlimited number of 
orders per block can be achieved. It is important to stress that the orders being pooled are 
encrypted, their timestamp and their hash being the only information visible to the pool. 

�is scaling method can be compared to what the Bitcoin Community is developing 
through the Lightning Network.  

3.2 �e Exchange 

3.2.1 User Interface 

A fast and responsive trading user interface using the latest Javascript technology. 

Node�S will be used for the backend and React�S for the frontend. �is stack has already 
proven its robustness and ability to support a large number of simultaneous connections. A 
vibrant community and ecosystem ensures the sustainability of this powerful stack. 

3.2.2 Matching engine 

�e �rst version of the matching engine will support the following types of orders: 

- limit orders 
- market orders  
- stop-loss orders 

14 



 

 

and the following matching algorithms: 

- FIFO 
- Pro-rata 
- Market Maker Allocation 

�e part allocated to each algorithm will be decided a�er consultation with the LGO 
holders. 

�e ratio allocated to market makers will ensure fair trading without penalizing market 
makers. 

3.2.3 Blockchain 

�e Legolas Exchange platform is designed to be ledger agnostic: it can easily be plu�ed 
into any blockchain. �e beta version of Legolas Exchange will use the Ethereum network 
but as soon as Legolas goes live with its current production system, the best blockchains 
will be used. Moreover, Legolas Exchange’s development team is currently studying the use 
of a much faster public ledger: the Byzantine Fault Tolerant. 

3.2.4 REST and Websocket APIs 

�e Legolas Exchange platform will provide a RESTFull API to consult the order book and 
make orders. A Websocket API will provide the latest trades and orders in real time.  

3.4 Full Stack Tools and Functionalities 

3.4.1 Custom Reports 

One of the most crucial tools that Legolas Exchange will provide is a full track record of 
past investments and trades and how they performed, enabling customers to  sort and 
�lter their data using various metrics, both visual and analytical. �ese reporting tools and 
visuals are commonly available on prime stock broker portals, and Legolas Exchange will 
replicate many of the same functionalities. Legolas Exchange’s reports will be available via 
CSV and an API and will meet the re�uirements and needs of all customers, from day 
traders to long term holders to large �nancial institutions. �e data will be stored in both 
a centralized server and on the blockchain.  

3.4.2 Portfolio Analysis Tools 

With Legolas Exchange, customers will have access to custom made analysis tools, such as 
pro�t & loss per trades, time period, type of digital asset, and volume. A full visual of the 

15 



 

 

portfolio value will also be available using sorting options by digital asset, market 
capitalization, balances, realized and unrealized gains. �e Legolas Exchange team plans to 
develop additional tools over time, with the goal of providing customers with valuable 
analysis and analytics enabling them to improve their trading strategies and optimize their 
investment returns.  

3.4.3 ICO Participation Functionalities 

Sophisticated crypto investors may be interested in participating in an ICO. Legolas 
Exchange will allow its customers to bene�t from a wide spectrum of investment options, 
including in-depth analysis of upcoming ICOs and exclusive large-volume discounts on 
investments made during pre-ICO phases.  Furthermore, there is no minimum investment 
amount re�uired, Legolas Exchanges values each investor, independently of the investment 
size.  

3.4.4 Tax Documents and Audit Log  

For institutional clients and others who re�uest it, Legolas Exchange will have an opt-in 
functionality that lets clients keep a detailed log of all transactions in order to 
automatically create tax documents. It will also generate a Capital Gains Report in a 
format that is already prepared for accountants and tax o�ces.  

In addition, Legolas Exchange’s platform is designed to be able to provide proof of reserve 
and audit reports to institutional customers who may re�uest them for their own auditing 
needs. 

4. Legolas Exchange Value Proposition 

4.1 Current Exchange Landscape 

4.1.1 Centralized Exchange 

A centralized exchange is a platform that facilitates transactions between cryptocurrencies 
and maybe �at currencies. Transactions between the exchange’s customers are recorded in 
the exchange’s internal ledger. Transactions are typically not recorded on a blockchain or 
on any outside ledger. �ere is no transparency and neither the account balance nor the 
transaction history can be viewed. �e majority of existing crypto exchanges are 
centralized exchanges. 

16 



 

 

4.1.2 Decentralized Exchange 

A decentralized exchange is a marketplace that matches buyers and sellers on its platform 
and facilitates their transaction on a decentralized ledger or blockchain. Trades occur 
directly between users (peer to peer) through an automated process facilitated by the 
exchange. �is system can be achieved, among other solutions that are currently being 
developed, by creating proxy tokens (crypto assets that represent a certain �at or crypto 
currency) or assets (that can represent shares in a company for example) or through a 
decentralized multi-signatures escrow system. 

Fully decentralized exchanges have existed since 2013 with MasterCoin and Counterparty. 
Aside from latency issues, one substantial limitation with these existing systems and those 
being developed is that transactions cannot occur between di�erent blockchains. As of 
now, pairs like ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, XRP/BTC or BTC/USD are not tradable on a fully 
decentralized system since there is no vector to transfer information from one blockchain 
to another on a fully decentralized system. 

Finally, decentralized exchange projects currently being developed don’t focus on �at 
deposit. We believe that �at deposit and withdrawal are important functionalities that 
must not be overlooked when trying to capture market shares. According to 
Coinmarketcap.com, the volume of intra-chain trading represents less than 2% of all

4.1.3 Legolas Exchange: A Hybrid Model 

At Legolas Exchange we have long believed in decentralized ledgers and applications, but 
at the same time we also believe not all functionalities should be decentralized. 
Decentralized computing wastes energy and can be replaced by centralized computing 
combined with decentralized ordered hash storage. Centralization, for its part, isn’t 
intrinsically bad and o�ers some irreplaceable features for real life applications, namely 
privacy, speed, simplicity and authority. Legolas Exchange therefore proposes a hybrid 
exchange that incorporates features of both centralized and decentralized systems. We are 
convinced that a decentralized blockchain can make centralized systems transparent, fair 
and, most importantly, trustworthy.

Front-running proo� : Impossible for the exchange to front run users’ orders. 

�roughput : Maximal number of orders that can be sent in a given amount of time.  

Fiat : Fiat currencies can be deposited into and withdrawn from the exchange. A �at 
currency is a currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but which is not 
backed by a physical commodity.  

External blockchain token : Ability to trade a token for a token in another blockchain. 

4.2 Legolas Exchange’s Business Model 

4.2.1 LGO Token 
LGO will be created as an ERC20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. LGO 
tokens will be re�uired for any and all  Legolas  functionalities, deposits, withdrawals, 
transactions and analyses. 

18 



 

 

4.2.2 Transaction Fees 

Legolas Exchange will not charge any bitcoin or cryptocurrency transaction fee, 
commission, or apply extra bid/ o�er  to any order on its platform. Instead, all transactions 
will re�uire LGO tokens to be used as fees or fuel to place orders on  Legolas Exchange.  

4.2.3 Additional Paying Analytical Functionalities 

In addition to regular trading, deposit and withdrawal exchange functionalities, Legolas 
Exchange will provide customers with opt-in paying analytical functionalities such as, for 
example,  research, analysis, statistical calculations, recommendations, etc. �ese 
functionalities will be payable in LGO. 

4.2.4 LGO Destruction 

As Legolas Exchange will charge all fees in LGO, it will accumulate LGOs over time. In 
order to reduce the LGO reserve that Legolas Exchange will hold relative to the overall 
supply of LGOs, Legolas Exchange will implement a transparent and veri�ed mechanism 
that destroys on each trade 25% of all LGO paid to Legolas Exchange as a transaction fee . 
As a result, the supply of LGO will decrease over time as the activity on Legolas Exchange 
increases, and the demand for each LGO will increase accordingly. LGO will be 
subdivisible  and fees will be adjusted to always re�ect the (balanced) e�uilibrium supply of 
LGO. 

4.2.5 LGO Li�uidity Providers Pool 

In order to attract market makers to Legolas Exchange and maximize li�uidity for users, 
Legolas Exchange will implement a transparent and veri�ed mechanism that transfers 25% 
of LGO paid to Legolas Exchange into an LGO Li�uidity Providers Pool. 

�e LGO Li�uidity Providers Pool will be redistributed to all market makers and users 
who add li�uidity to Legolas Exchange order books. Legolas Exchange will charge negative 
LGO commission rates to users who add li�uidity and adjust those credits over time in 
order to keep the LGO Li�uidity Providers Pool close to empty at the end of every month. 
Overall, 50% of all LGO paid to Legolas Exchange will be either destroyed (25%) or 
transferred to the LGO Li�uidity Providers Pool.

5. LGO Token Creation 

5.1 Pre-sale Information 

LGO tokens will be o�ered in a private, invitation only pre-sale restricted to a selected 
group of �nancial and crypto professionals. A second phase will open the sale to sponsored

Funds Governance  Legolas Exchange SAS Board. Fund will be kept in 
multisig address re�uiring the signature of a majority of 
the board. 

 

5.2 ICO Method 

Legolas has made the decision to accept only bitcoins for its ICO. Each buyer has her own 
multisig address. Addresses are pre-generated o�ine using the BIP32 algorithm. �is 
design was chosen for the following reasons:  

 

1. Security:  Bitcoin multisig is more robust than an Ethereum contract for storing 
large amounts. 

2. Simplicity:  Buyers can send BTC from any address even exchanges like Kraken or 
Poloniex. 

3. Fairness:  Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, accepting multiple currencies 
raises issues of pricing and exchange rates. Buyers using di�erent currencies would 
end up paying di�erent prices for the token. 

 

To redeem ICO funds, the signature of a minimum of 2 funders is re�uired. 

�e server used for the ICO holds no private or public keys, only addresses. 

5.3 Round 0  

Minimum 20% of LGO tokens are reserved for advisors, partners and �nancial and 
cryptocurrency professionals. �is ensures that LGO holders are dedicated and involved 

21 



 

 

and not simply speculating. �e exact price in Round 0 will be known only at the end of 
Rounds 1 and 2 but will certainly be advantageous. Regardless, at least 20% of the tokens 
will be distributed during Round 0. To achieve this goal we are using a formula inspired by 
convertible notes: 

 

Percentage of total supply sold during the pre-sale: 

LGO_SOLD = 60% 

 

Minimum percentage of total supply sold to Round 0 buyers: 

MINIMUM_ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE = 20% 

 

Bonus for Round 0 buyers: 

BONUS_ROUND_0 = 20% 

 

Amount sold during Round 0: 

CAP_ROUND_0_BEFORE_DISCOUNT = 1000 BTC 

 

Amount used to calculate the �nal price: 

CAP_ROUND_0 = CAP_ROUND_0_BEFORE_DISCOUNT + BONUS_ROUND_0 = 1200 

BTC 

 

Total amount sold during the whole pre-sale: 

TOTAL_CAP = CAP_ROUND_0 + CAP_ROUND_1 + CAP_ROUND_2 

 

Percentage distributed to Round 0 buyers calculated pro rata with the  TOTAL_CAP: 

ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE_CAP = (CAP_ROUND_0 / TOTAL_CAP) * LGO_SOLD 

 

�e �nal percentage distributed to Round 0 buyers is the maximum of 
ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE_CAP  and  MINIMUM_ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE: 

ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE = MAX(ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE_CAP - 

MINIMUM_ROUND_0_PERCENTAGE) 

 

�is algorithm ensures that the price of LGO for Round 0 buyers will decrease 
proportionally to the success of Rounds 1 and 2: 

22 



 

 

 

Conversely, it also ensures that the total percentage held by Round 0 buyers will increase 
proportionally to any shortfalls in Rounds 1 and 2:

5.4 LGO 2-Year Holding Bonus 

5% of the initial issuance will be issued each 6 months over 2 years (20% in total). Each time, 
the tokens will be distributed to LGO holders who have not sold any LGOs held at the 
address where they initially received the tokens. �e token will be prorated between LGO 
holders who have respected this rule.  

�is feature is meant as an incentive for participant in the initial LGO token sale to hold 
their tokens for at least two years.  

5.5 Use of Proceeds 

Funding raised through the pre-sale will be used to accelerate the construction of the 
Legolas platform. �e distribution of funds will, in priority, go towards development, 
infrastructure and key hires such as senior developers, system administrators and �nancial 
experts. 

External Development 

Legolas Exchange is in touch with several small and medium exchanges that may be 
interested in partnerships and ac�uisitions by Legolas Exchange. 

Education and Community Support 

Legolas Exchange is deeply committed to the crypto community and is actively engaged in 
the development of Bitcoin and educational e�orts aimed at making Bitcoin a widely used 
currency. 

24 



 

 

Lobbying 

Legolas Exchange has established contacts with the French government in order to assist in 
the building of a legal framework for cryptocurrency and ICOs.  

 

Reserve 

Legolas Exchange will maintain a locked reserve to protect the value of the LGO and deal 
with unforeseen events.

ANNEX 

1. Financial Institutions Are Embracing Crypto 

�is year has seen vast capital in�ows into crypto currencies. Nevertheless, the amount 
pales in comparison to the substantially larger investments that will come from 
institutional investors and �nancial advisors in the months and years ahead. Up to now, 
large and professional investors have been missing the security and many of the tools they 
need to enter the crypto market. Legolas Exchange is embracing this future in�ow and is 
o�ering to build these functionalities to bene�t both existing and incoming investors and 
traders alike. 

1.1 Alternative Investment Is in Vogue 

Over  the last 10 years, institutional money managers have been steadily increasing their 
holdings in alternative investments in order to diversify their portfolios and increase 
expected risk adjusted long term returns. According to PricewaterhouseCooper, by 2020 
global assets in alternative investments will grow to US$18.1 trillion, from $10 trillion 
today. 

�is large and growing allocation means that institutional investors such as wealth 
managers, endowments, investment funds and sovereign wealth funds are constantly 
looking for new asset classes and products that present positive growth expectations.  

Crypto currencies and digital tokens are perfectly positioned to be one of the leading 
investment class and receive a large proportion of those 18 trillion dollars. 

1.2 Cryptocurrencies Are Outperforming Majors Assets by Far 

One of the most telling metrics supporting the thesis that �nancial institution will invest 
heavily in crypto currencies is that the performance of cryptocurrencies has lowered the 
returns seen by e�uity benchmarks over the last few years. Bitcoin return has outperformed 
the S&P 500 by a factor of 35 since April 2013. Even when using the Sortino ratio, a 
measure of risk-adjusted return, Bitcoin has largely outperformed all asset classes over the 
last seven years.  

 

 

29 



 

 

 

1.3 A Near-uncorrelated Asset 

In a globalized world where markets are becoming more interconnected , building a stable 
portfolio made of diversi�ed investments is increasingly di�cult. Finding uncorrelated 
investments is both challenging and incredibly rewarding for an institutional investor 
looking to create a diversi�ed portfolio with stable long-term returns.  

In this context, one can calculate that the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 
over the last 5 years is almost 0 (3% to be exact). �is incredibly low correlation is attractive 
to large investors as a way of reducing their portfolio risk. 

 

   

Bitcoin Correlation with S&P 500 - average of only 3% 

2013  2014  2015  2016  2017 

-1%  1.67%  13.02%  -9.20%  6.79% 

 

In fact, Bitcoin can even serve as a hedge against harmful geopolitical events due to its 
decentralized nature. �ere is a growing body of empirical evidence supporting this thesis 
with, for example, bitcoin price spiking in response to both Brexit and the election of 
Donald Trump. 

�is calculation can be extended to other �nancial asset classes such as bonds, 
commodities, real estate and currencies with similar results: cryptocurrencies present a 
uni�ue combination of positive expected growth and no correlation to established 
investment opportunities.  

30 



 

 

1.4 A Growing Demand for Crypto Assets 

Digital currencies have found favor among individual investors, but remain a niche 
phenomenon among the wider investment community.  

�e growing demand by all types of investors for digital currencies has had a positive e�ect 
on the �nancial industry, leading them to view cryptocurrencies and digital assets as a 
major new market opportunity for their investors and clients.  

One of the best illustrations of this attempt by �nancial professionals to enter the crypto 
market are the many attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to create indices and 
securities that would track the price of Bitcoin or ICO performance. While ETFs 
(Exchange Traded Fund) have not been approved in any country yet, several �nancial 
institutions are currently petitioning regulators in North America, the United Kingdom 
and continental Europe. Sweden already has an ETN (Exchange Traded Note) tracking the 
price of Bitcoin listed on the Stockholm stock exchange with a market capitalization of 
$90M. 

Seven global banks (BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, CitiBank, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, 
Banco Santander, Standard Chartered) h ave announced plans to integrate future use of 
cryptocurrencies. 

�ese evolutions will continue to mature and accelerate in the coming months and years, 
opening a �ood of investments intro cryptocurrencies and digital assets.  

Saxo Bank analyst Kay Van-Petersen estimates that cryptocurrencies will account for 10% 
of the average daily volume of �at currency trades within 10 years, with Bitcoin alone 
accounting for $175 billion a day.
