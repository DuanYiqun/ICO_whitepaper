 3 | ABSTRACT

HOLD is a revolutionary card that provides instant cash 

against cryptocurrency collateral. It allows users to leverage 

their portfolio without having to sell it. By the means of the 

prepaid card and of a mobile app, it enables online and offline 

purchases with over 45 million retailers worldwide and over 3 

million ATMs.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin can be used as collateral for 

cash advances at a competitive rate of 8% p.a., not requir-

ing a good credit history and without geographic restrictions. 

Instead of selling their assets, members can utilize them to 

receive  instant cash, or make online purchases — while still 

maintaining their cryptocurrency holdings. This may also re-

sult in a potential tax deferment, depending on the jurisdiction 

of the borrower.

Memberships are available to all compatible jurisdictions 

through the process of staking the platform-native token 

(HOLD) for a fixed period of time, which are returned to the 

user after their membership ends.

HOLD card holders earn HOLD tokens every time they use their 

card. On almost all purchases, the HOLD platform will provide 

a 1% cashback in HOLD tokens, directly into the user’s wallet.

Liquidity is provided by means of an incentivized lender pro-

gram through which users fund their HOLD wallets with fiat or

crypto. The platform will progressively match provided liquidity 

with cash advances, producing lucrative and low-risk returns 

of up to 7.5% p.a. for lenders, representing a lucrative mon-

ey-making opportunity.



 5 | PROBLEM

1 | “A look back at bitcoin price swings 

in the last five years, which include 

several stomach-churning tumbles of 

40% and even 50%, makes it clear 

the world’s most popular crypto-cur-

rency was—and is—extremely volatile.”.

tory/

PROBLEM

The crypto-economy is one of the most volatile we have ever 

seen. For persons trading or holding against fiat currencies 

such as the U.S. Dollar or Euro, it implies that the valuation of 

their portfolio can fluctuate exponentially within a short period 

of time1.

Selling cryptocurrencies while the market is on a downswing 

can be a tough but necessary measure. Historically, there has 

never been a bad time to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin. In 

cases of urgency or simply as a matter of convenience, one has 

no alternative but to sell. All while knowing that the market is 

most likely to recover at a later date and potentially losing out 

on significant returns.

HOLD instant cash advances are ideal for urgent expenses, 

such as a medical bill or car repair. Another scenario simply 

waiting for more favorable market conditions. Placing crypto-

currencies as collateral may not result in a tax event in some 

jurisdictions. In an economy as volatile as this one, the ability to 

rapidly and effortlessly leverage cryptocurrencies without losing 

opportunities for potential gains is priceless.

 6 | SOLUTION

Offering a lending and borrowing platform, in which members 

will be able to leverage cryptocurrencies and obtain instant 

cash advances directly on an exclusive prepaid payment card.

Cash advances are short term loans given against crypto-

currency collateral, accessible exclusively through the HOLD 

prepaid card. The duration of those cash advances range from 

1 to 3 months at a pro-rated, pre-paid interest rate of up to 

8% p.a., payable by the borrower. Collateral can be provided 

in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin and cash advances may be 

settled at any time.

The HOLD prepaid card may be utilised at ATMs worldwide, 

as well as online and offline purchases with over 45 million 

retailers around the world and this figure is expected to dou-

ble to over 90 million retailers3 by 2020. Presently, fiat is the 

predominant force and foundation of the economy and while 

crypto is experiencing exponential growth, this is also coun-

tered by highly volatile markets. HOLD showcases the best 

of both worlds, by providing instant liquidity and the ability to 

retain cryptocurrencies and their potential gains.

 7 | SOLUTION

Liquidity is provided by lenders funding their HOLD accounts 

with either fiat, or cryptocurrencies which are converted to 

fiat. Lenders receive an interest between 4.5 and 7.5% p.a. 

for funds that are matched with a cash advance request4. The 

platform offers additional incentives for lenders through a 

status points program utilizing HOLD tokens5.

With traditional credit institutions usually offering an inter-

est of around 3% p.a., HOLD offers an extremely competitive 

return opportunity for individuals interested in collateralized 

lending with minimum risk.

4 | Lenders only gain interest on funds 

committed to cash advances, i.e. 

funds that are utilized by the system.

5 | Additional incentives are paid in 

HOLD tokens for lenders providing  

significant liquidity and/or liquidity for 

longer periods of time.



 8 | CARD

The HOLD card is the driving force of the platform and pres-

ents a unique value proposition for users:  It is easy to use, 

instant and widely available,  online and offline, at millions of 

retailers and ATMs around the world.

Offering a premium design and all the features one would ex-

pect from a modern and technically advanced card: Contact-

less payments, advanced security features and live transac-

tion notifications directly on the phone. The HOLD card is also 

available in multiple fiat currencies and provides a competitive 

cashback program.

CARD

 8 | CARD



 9 | CARD

A key feature of the HOLD Card is that cryptocurrencies do not 

back the cash advances provided by lenders. Even when cash 

advances are provided in cryptocurrencies by lenders, these 

are converted to fiat currency before funding the HOLD Card. 

HOLD is therefore providing a cryptocurrency-free payment 

solution.

CASHBACK PROGRAM
 

An incentive program for using the  HOLD card that rewards 

borrowers on qualifying card purchases with a 1% cashback. 

All bonuses are provided in HOLD tokens, conveniently cred-

ited into the user’s mobile wallet. HOLD tokens can be with-

drawn, converted into cash advances or used in settlements.

FIAT CURRENCIES
 

Cards are provided in the currency of the account, which can be:

U.S. Dollar (USD)

Euros (EUR)

Pound Sterling (GBP)

LIMITED EDITION
 

Our Limited Edition HOLD card is exclusively available to 

contributors obtaining the Visionary Status throughout our 

ICO. The unique features and design of this card will not be 

available after, and it is limited to a maximum of 1,000 cards 

worldwide.



 10 | BORROWING

The HOLD platform uses lender matching to provide borrowers 

with instant cash advances against cryptocurrency collateral. 

Driven by constantly evolving algorithms and using data-sci-

ence driven machine learning, HOLD presents an easy and fast 

solution when traditional fiat liquidity is required.

A key feature of the HOLD Card is that cryptocurrencies are 

never being utilized to back the cash advances. Instead, only 

fiat obtained from lenders is used to fund the card, making it a 

cryptocurrency-free payment solution.

BORROWING



 11 | BORROWING

CASH ADVANCES 
 

Cash Advances simply require a smartphone and the standard 

documents required to verify the borrower’s identity through 

Know Your Customer (KYC). Once verified, borrowers can use 

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to fund their wallets with the 

necessary collateral that will grant them access to cash ad-

vances.

These cash advances are available through physical and/or 

virtual prepaid cards which can be used with millions of mer-

chants while the physical cards can be used at over 3 millions 

ATMs worldwide.



 12 | BORROWING

EXAMPLE 6

John needs $500 for his monthly expenses but he expects the cryp-

to market to go higher and he prefers not to sell right now. Instead, he 

deposits 1 ETH (worth $1,000) into his HOLD wallet and he requests 50% 

of it as a cash advance. After one week, Ether has risen by 30%7, and his 

1 ETH is now worth $1,300. John decides to settle his cash advance which 

only requires him to sell 0.38 ETH instead of 0.5 ETH. The remaining bal-

ance of 0.62 ETH is returned to his wallet.

DURATIONS 
 

Cash Advances can be requested for periods of 1, 2 or 3 

months with conditional renewals being an option, subject to 

additional fees and availability.

A cash advance can be renewed beyond 3 months if needed, 

given that sufficient liquidity is available in the platform. Ad-

ditional platform fees for the renewal may apply at whichever 

rate they are defined  at a given point in time.

7 |  Examples for this in 2017 include 18-25 

May, 16-23 June, 18-25 Nov and 10-17 Dec.

6 |   For demonstration purposes the 

example excludes interest and plat-

form fees of the cash advance.



 13 | BORROWING

FEE MODEL
 

The fee model for cash advances is simple, fair and high-

ly transparent. Consisting of annual interest and a one-off 

amount based platform fee. All fees are indicated and paid 

upfront, before the cash advance has been approved.

INTEREST RATES

Interest rates are fixed at a prorated 8% p.a. The interest for 

cash advances is paid upfront for the entire duration and is 

non-refundable.

EXAMPLES

• A cash advance of $2,500 for 1 month incurs interest of $16.50 (0.66%).

• A cash advance of $1,000 for 2 months incurs interest of  $13.30 (1.33%).

• A cash advance of $500 for 3 months incurs interest of $10 (2%).

PLATFORM FEES 

In addition to interest rates, which are primarily paid to the 

lenders and depend on the duration, cash advances will also 

incur platform fees to be paid by the borrower. These are fixed 

at 3% of the total amount of the cash advance, regardless of 

its duration.

EXAMPLE

• A cash advance of $2,500 incurs platform fees of $75 (3%).

• A cash advance of $1,000 incurs platform fees of  $30 (3%).

• A cash advance of $500 incurs platform fees of $15 (3%).



 14 | BORROWING

LIQUIDATIONS
 

A liquidation is the process of selling off parts or all of the 

cryptocurrency collateral if the fiat value of it no longer cov-

ers a safe margin to the cash advance requested. They are a 

necessary procedure for the HOLD platform, reducing risk for 

lenders and therefore stimulating a growth in  liquidity.

To protect borrowers from losing their collateral, the HOLD 

platform offers the opportunity to the borrower to ask for up 

to 65% of the current fiat value. At this maximum it is consid-

ered a high-risk choice and it may result in a loss of collateral 

if the market decreases in value by approximately 24%.

If triggered, collateral funds are automatically liquidated (sold 

off to the market) through partner exchanges. This process 

is monitored and managed by our HOLD Trading Oracle and 

driven by high-frequency market analysis.

EXAMPLE

Natasha deposits 0.5 BTC (worth $5,000) into her HOLD account and 

requests the maximum of 65% as a cash advance worth $3,250. Two 

weeks later, Bitcoin has decreased in value by 40%, reducing the value of 

Natasha’s collateral to $3,000. Consequently, her cash advance is liqui-

dated and her Bitcoin is being sold.

In case of a liquidation of a cash advance, the collateral will be 

sold through integrated partner exchanges to assure a swift 

conversion to fiat funds, settling the cash advance on both — 

lender and borrower — sides.  Any funds exceeding the settle-

ment amount will be returned to the borrower in the form of fiat.



 15 | BORROWING

SETTLEMENTS
 

Borrowers can settle cash advances at any given time during 

the full duration. Using the mobile app, the settlement can 

take place whenever the market conditions are most favor-

able. Since fees are paid upfront before the contract is es-

tablished, there are no early-settlement or other hidden fees. 

Settlements are closed with a single tap.

When settling, only the amount necessary will be sold through 

partner exchanges, while the remaining cryptocurrency funds 

will automatically be returned to the borrower (see this Exam-

ple). This allows full flexibility throughout the cash advance 

duration to sell whenever the borrower sees fit. Alternatively, 

cash advances can also be settled with fiat balance within the 

HOLD platform, which can be deposited via secure ACH, SEPA 

and SWIFT bank transfers in U.S. Dollars, Euros and Pound 

Sterling.

Cash Advances will auto-settle at the end of their duration if 

not renewed.



 16 | BORROWING

EXTENSIONS
 

Given sufficient liquidity and the availability of funds to pay 

the cash advance fees, cash advances can be renewed. This is 

subject to availability and may incur additional fees.

LIMITS
 

Cash Advances are limited to 15,000 U.S. Dollars or 10,000 

Euros/Pound Sterling.



 17 | LENDING

Lenders are a vital part of the HOLD platform as they provide 

liquidity for cash advances. By adding fiat funds to their HOLD 

accounts, lenders can gain between 4.5 and 7.5% p.a. on all 

committed liquidity8. Interest is paid by the borrowers. All in-

terest is prepaid for the entire duration of a cash advance and 

paid out in full, even if the cash advance is to be settled before 

its expiration. The platform’s algorithms aim to maximize the 

use of liquidity and ensure that maximum interest is being 

generated at all times.

LENDING

8 | Only  liquidity  used in cash advanc-

es will generate interest. The HOLD 

platform aims to use all liquidity most 

of the time.



 18 | LENDING

FUNDING 
 

Every verified lender9 within the HOLD platform has the pos-

sibility to fund their personal wallets through traditional bank 

wires. Alternatively, the HOLD platform will also allow lenders 

to fund their accounts with cryptocurrency assets which are 

immediately converted to fiat funds, exclusively through a 

third party exchange, upon receipt.

INTEREST 
 

Lenders are incentivized to use the HOLD platform by receiv-

ing interest accrued on their cash advances. All committed 

liquidity generates between 4.5% and 7.5% interest per year. 

Note that not all available liquidity is generating interest all the 

time. Instead, funds are progressively being used by matching 

fiat funds and cash advances.

All interest is being paid after the cash advance is settled, but 

is immediately visible as pending in the interest transaction 

log. Through the HOLD mobile app, lenders can conveniently 

track all pending and paid interest.

With all interest being prepaid by the borrower ahead of the 

cash advance being provided, earlier settlements are expected 

to be common and may result in a higher than expected yield 

for lenders.

tion process see Account Verification.



 19 | LENDING

EXAMPLE

Lucas funds his lender account with $10,000 via bank wire. His funds 

are matched with a 2-month cash advance of $8,000. Lucas’ funds have 

now generated $80 in interest at 6% p.a., leaving $2,000 for other cash 

advances which will progressively be matched with other borrowers.

STATUS POINTS & LEVELS 
 

The more liquidity is provided, the higher interest rate lenders 

may expect. In the Banker Status this is up to 7.5% per year. 

See Status Points & Levels.



 20 | LENDING

WITHDRAWAL 
 

Uncommitted10 lender funds can be withdrawn at any given 

time, while funds generating interest may be locked until cash 

advances are settled. Borrowers can request cash advances 

for up to 3 months so lender funds may be locked up for up for 

this duration.

Lenders can decide to become “inactive” in which case their 

funds will no longer be matched with cash advance requests. 

Within a maximum of 3 months, all funds will become uncom-

mitted and therefore be available for withdrawal.

RISKS 
 

The risks of using the HOLD platform are considered low due 

to HOLDs proprietary High Accuracy Lending Technology algo-

rithm — HALT — which ensures that collateral assets are held in 

secure cold storage unless they are at risk of being liquidated.

Once flagged for a potential liquidation, HALT ensures that 

sufficient liquidity is ready to be sold into the market through 

partner exchanges. Paired with the safety margin calculated 

by HOLD platform at the moment of requesting a cash ad-

vance, it greatly lowers the risk level for the lender.

10 | Fiat funds provided by the lender 

that are not currently committed to 

cash advances.



 21 | PLATFORM

The HOLD platform is powered by an advanced HOLD Trading 

Oracle, featuring:
 

• Our proprietary HALT algorithm

• Partner Exchange Integrations

• Payment Processor Handling

HOLD TRADING ORACLE 
 

The HOLD Trading Oracle is the driving force that sustains the 

HOLD platform and it not only serves for leveraging cryptocur-

rency assets and matching them against fiat liquidity, but also 

for calculating cash advance fees.. At its core sits our propri-

etary HALT algorithm that significantly reduces risks associat-

ed with lending against high volatility collateral assets such as 

Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin.

HALT ALGORITHM 
 

The High Accuracy Lending Technology — HALT — is the algo-

rithm powered by machine learning that continuously moni-

tors the market conditions to predict which cash advances are 

at risk of being liquidated. It uses historical and live market 

data of partner exchanges to generate highly accurate risk 

assessments.

PLATFORM



 22 | PLATFORM

This allows the HOLD platform to keep most of its collateral 

funds securely stored and unexposed to the outside world, 

while simultaneously ensuring at that sufficient liquidity is 

available on partner exchanges to execute liquidations as 

needed.

Furthermore, HALT also provides borrowers with risk aware-

ness, notifying them if one of their cash advances is at risk of 

being liquidated and when. Note that the times of liquidation 

and general risk assessments are — while usually highly accu-

rate — not guaranteed in any way. 



 23 | MEMBERSHIPS

The usage of the HOLD platform requires annual member-

ships. Both, borrowers and lenders alike, need to register and 

pass through account verification before their accounts be-

come fully operational. All memberships are subject to avail-

ability.

BORROWERS 
 

Borrowers gain access to an exclusive prepaid card which 

allows them to withdraw cash from ATMs worldwide, as well 

as make online and offline purchases without needing to sell 

their cryptocurrency assets.

TOKEN STAKING 

To become a borrower, applicants are required stake an 

amount of HOLD tokens for a minimum of  6 months. During 

this time, the tokens are locked up in an Ethereum smart con-

tract and cannot be withdrawn. 

After the minimum lockup period ends, the membership is 

valid for as long as the tokens are staked. If withdrawn, the 

membership and all associated benefits are automatically 

revoked and this also triggers the settlement of all open cash 

advances.

MEMBERSHIPS



 24 | MEMBERSHIPS

LENDERS 
 

Membership for lenders is free and allows for the accumu-

lation of status points to earn higher interest on their lender 

account balance. By providing liquidity, and providing this 

liquidity for longer, the more status points they earn and the 

more interest and incentives they gain.

STATUS POINTS 

The primary way to earn points is through balance in the lend-

er account. Every U.S. Dollar, Euro or Pound counts for 1 point 

after 30 days of maturing in the account. The more liquidity 

provided, the more points will be earned.

EXAMPLE

Antonio funds his lender account with $50,000. After 30 days of matur-

ing his funds, he earned 50,000 points on his balance and obtains the 

Tycoon Status. Antonio now earns up to 6% instead of 4.5% interest per 

year on his balance.

Additionally, balance appreciates in point value over time. For 

every month in which the balance was not withdrawn by the 

lender, it gains 5% in additional point value. Note that the ap-

preciation in value cannot exceed 50% of the balance based 

status points earned.



 25 | MEMBERSHIPS

EXAMPLE

Julia funds her lender account with $8,000. After 6 months her balance 

has appreciated in point value, providing her with 10,210 points. This enti-

tles her to the Staker Status. Julia now earns up to 5.1% instead of 4.5% 

interest per year on her balance. Additionally, after 9 months the point 

appreciation caps out at 12,000 and Julia no longer earns any new points.

 27 | TOKEN

UTILITY 
 

The HOLD token’s primary purpose is to allow a membership 

system, provide a cashback program and pay additional in-

centives to lenders through a status level program.

TOKEN



 28 | TOKEN

VALUE STRATEGY 

The value strategy of the HOLD token is unique as it features 

multiple mechanisms to stimulate its growth.

• Membership staking in HOLD tokens

• A 1% cashback program in HOLD tokens

• Platform buying back HOLD tokens, providing liquidity

• Platform burning HOLD tokens, decreasing total supply

MEMBERSHIP STAKING 

Borrowers require the staking of HOLD tokens for a period of 6 

months. This period should represent market conditions fairly 

and  is subject to change. A large number of active member-

ships will benefit all token holders, as fewer tokens in circula-

tion should stabilize the price.

BUYBACK MECHANISM 

By continuously purchasing HOLD tokens through partner 

exchanges, the platform provides a consistent flow of volume 

for the token. HOLD requires a constant supply of tokens that 

need to be bought for its cashback program, lender incentives 

and burn mechanism.

BURN MECHANISM 

The HOLD platform comes with a burn mechanism that will 

decrease the total supply over time. Using a variety of sourc-

es, it will burn tokens through the HOLD Trading Oracle. This 

permanently and continuously decreases the total supply of 

tokens available, leaving token holders with an appreciation of 

individual token value.



 29 | TOKEN

SOURCES OF BURNT TOKENS 

• Up to 0.5% of all collected platform fees

• Up to 25% of all net fees generated by HOLD card purchases

Note that no more than 130,000,000 HOLD tokens per year will 

be bought and burnt, and the entire mechanism will be bal-

anced around supply and demand by the HOLD Trading Oracle. 

This process will cease once the minimum of 130,000,000 

tokens is reached. No tokens will be burned beyond this point.

IMPLEMENTATION 
 

The HOLD token and ICO is implemented on the Ethereum net-

work as an ERC20 token. In recent months Ethereum has seen 

widespread adoption and support by the Enterprise Ethereum 

Alliance (EEA).

Given the existing infrastructure and support of developers 

and miners alike, it is considered the standard for digital to-

kens and offers the perfect environment for the HOLD token. It 

brings benefits such as hardware wallet support, as well as a 

tested and turing12 13 complete  language for developers.12 | A simple explanation on what it 
means to be turing complete: https://

 30 | DISTRIBUTION

The HOLD distribution period (ICO) will be conducted over 

three rounds. A private round, a pre-seed round, followed by 

a public sale (scheduled for early-May 2018). Only accepting 

Ether (ETH) as a means of contributing, the public sale round 

is set to last a maximum of 28 days or until the hard cap is 

reached.

The minimum amount to be raised is $3,500,000 and the sale 

will stop when all contributions, including private and pre-seed 

funding, exceed $11,300,000. Transactions will be refunded if 

the ICO falls short of the minimum, so will transactions be-

yond the maximum raising goal.

All public contributions must be made in Ether (ETH). Any 

other assets sent to the address provided once the ICO starts 

will be permanently lost. The technology is implemented as 

a hybrid Smart Contract Oracle, allowing contributors to send 

funds transparently for everybody to see and verify on the 

blockchain.

A maximum of 1,300,000,000 HOLD tokens will be issued. 

All tokens not sold by the end of the ICO will be burnt. HOLD 

tokens will be on sale during the public round at a rate of 

0.00004 ETH per HOLD token.

Contributors of the ICO need to pass account verification

VISIONARY STATUS 
 

Contributors of the HOLD ICO can obtain this exclusive status 

— limited to a maximum 1,000 members. It comes with major 

perks and is granted for the entire lifespan of the member-

GENERAL

In recent months, ICOs have come under close regulatory 

scrutiny around the world, owing to the unclear legal status of 

the issuance of cryptocurrencies and the fund-raising result-

ing from the ICO itself. The digital token market is still in its 

relative infancy and there is not yet a consensus or agreement 

on the nature and categorization of digital tokens. Consider-

ing that the legislative and regulatory framework for ICOs and 

cryptocurrencies in Malta is currently being discussed, HOLD 

Funding Limited will endeavour to comply with any law or ob-

tain any required licence which may become applicable to its 

ICO and/or cryptocurrency-related activities at a future date.
