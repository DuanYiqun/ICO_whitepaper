Technology is progressing by leaps and bounds. It is introducing new terms and 
systems for business and communications on daily basis. The internet has made a 
large contribution to this advancement' especially when it comes to the field of 
business. Online trading or online currency trading has recently attracted many 
traders. One of the common forms of online trading is Bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin 
Exchange is a new system of money for the internet that works on the concept of 
digital currency. It initializes the peer to peer payment system for individuals 
having no central authority.

A new concept of cryptocurrency is used that was initially introduced in 1998. 
Cryptographic controls the creation and transaction of digital money. Bitcoin 
works through a software and does not have central controlling authority so it is 
equally managed and controlled by its users around the globe. 

One can work with Bitcoin exchange just like it works with any other kind of currency 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

exchange. Just like working with banks it is easy to make transactions through 
Bitcoin exchange. Analogous to physical trade the user has to pay to purchase 
Bitcoins. The difference is that the person has to open an account with a Bitcoin 
exchanger. The paid asset of the user will be available in the form of digital 
currency that can be used to purchase any kind of product as long as the seller 
accepts Bitcoins. Bitcoins may be exchanged with the banks. Bitcoin currency 
exchange is quite new. It is a sort of software base payment system where you 
make transactions digitally. Here is how it can benefit you:

§ Make transactions quicker than other systems.

§ Always available for transactions.

§ Make transactions from anywhere in the world.

§ Make safer transactions.

§ Perform transactions without interference of any third party.

§ Monitor all transactions from Home, PC or from smartphone.

§ Purchasing and kind of assets.

The process of finding a Bitcoin exchange is more than finding one with the best-
looking website. The factors to consider when choosing an exchange includes.
1. LIQUIDITY 
2. COST OF TRADING 
3. ACCESSIBILITY

1. Liquidity
Instead of choosing an exchange simply because 
of the beautiful looking website, you need to 
consider some important characteristics such as 
the liquidity. The fact that the market is based on 
people looking to buy or sell the currency, means 
that you need to consider how much liquidity an 
exchange has.

3. Accessibility
Being an online exchange 
methods; Bitcoins are 
prone to  hack ing by 
malicious parties. Hacking 
would be primarily to alter 
the figures, cause a drop in 
the value of Bitcoins, and 
profit the hackers. Choose 
a firm that uses the latest 
anti-hacking software to 
ensure the safety of your 
Bitcoin.

2. Cost of Trading
Choose the firm that uses more stable rates to 
avoid sudden fluctuations in profit

COMPANY OVERVIEW

BITXOXO's core values are driven by the 
desire to set a standard of professionalism 
in the cryptocurrency industry and operate 
ethically through collaborations and 
business relationship with core players in 
the industry. BITXOXO is owned and 
operated by experienced personnel in the 
industry. The company specializes in 
services aligned to cryptocurrency trading 
as it provides a platform that enables users 
to trade with a secure confidence. We are 
building this solution with the customer 
focus.  We believe by thinking about the 
customer at every step of the way we will 
be successful. The company plans to deliver 
exceptional customer service that retains 
and maintains a growing customer base in 
the bitcoin industry.

Risk Management

The management of BITXOXO understands the challenges relating to 
the collections of risks connected to doing business in the 
cryptocurrency trading industry. It is evidenced that the activities and 
processes associated with this kind of business have a clear intention of 
applying systematic risk management techniques. Personnel working 
with the company would need to pay positive attention to all aspects of 
the day-to-day business activities and be fully cognizant of the known 
risks. The largest single risk is the potentiality in the emergence of new 
and direct competitors in the operating market. 

Page 07



It is believed that this is a crucial reason for BITXOXO to continually improve the 
quality of services for financial transactions so that the company could be 
equipped for recognition even as competition increases within the niche.
 
To provide a starting point for the development of BITXOXO’s risk assessment 
methodology; the following preliminary risk matrix outlines typical risks 
associated with doing business in the trading industry.

RISK FACTORS
Risk #1 - Distinguishing BITXOXO's brand in the Bitcoin market
Mitigation Strategy:
§ Plan and execute operational strategies professionally.
§ Continually improve customer service and build a relationship with core 

targets in the market.
§ Communicate service value to users and form mutually beneficial alliances 

with stakeholders in the industry.
§ Develop strong online and on-site a�liations.
§ Maximize viral marketing activities.

Risk #2 – Developing and Retaining a Loyal Customer Base
      Retention of existing customers is always easier than finding new ones.
Mitigation Strategy:
§ Exceed customer's expectations and deal with issues professionally.
§ Reach out and create market awareness that influences increased patronage.
§ Review strategies based on feedbacks from current and prospective 

customers.
§ Strengthen BITXOXO's brand through content marketing (e.g. through blog)

Risk #3 - Low Barriers to Entry
           Competitors could enter the market.
Mitigation Strategy:
§ Develop a brand relationship that will inspire loyalty.
§ Hire competent and experienced professionals.
§ Build a community of loyal customer base.
§ Be thorough and professional.
§ Develop a structured feedback mechanism.

Page 08



MARKETING STRATEGY

BITXOXO has gathered as much market intelligence as possible about the 
potential market segment for cryptocurrencies. Comparative market research in 
developing countries introduces several important complexities, including 
language, culture, currency, and customs. These factors are particularly relevant 
for diverse countries such as India. The Company is confident that it possesses the 
requisite knowledge and sensitivities to deal with these complexities. By 
understanding our target market and potential competitors, we will develop our 
competitive positioning and will know where to invest our time, money, and 
developmental resources. 

Market research is thus a crucial focus point for the Company.  The primary 
objectives of BITXOXO's research efforts will be to ascertain how our products will 
fit into the market, what their sales potential is, and what it will cost to achieve this 
potential.

BITXOXO plans to mitigate the risk of entering into new markets by acquiring as 
much information about those markets as possible.  In this way, risk will not be 
avoided, but it will become more manageable.  

BITXOXO intends to build a strong, sustainable business model through 
consistent growth and expansion by acquiring niche businesses in India and 
other parts of the world.

Page 09



EXPANSION PLAN

Business growth is imminent. BITXOXO shall engage proven marketing 
campaign tactics in creating awareness about the online trading for 
cryptocurrencies.  Also, the company shall commit to weighing and reviewing 
feedbacks from current and prospective customers while leveraging on word of 
mouth advantage from satisfied customers to build brand equity in the financial 
tech market. One of the avenues through which BITXOXO would expand market 
reach is through aggressive marketing campaign on various social media and 
financials events/forums. Also, a continuous proof of operational excellence 
would go a long way in promoting the brand online and look into equity 
financing. Engaging online interface with current/prospective customers is 
equally critical towards fostering customer base expansion in the financial 
industry.

KEYS TO SUCCESS

BITXOXO recognizes that success in business is based on unconditional 
commitment and focus on transforming business goals into success. Being a 
company with the commitment to serve people who are new and experienced to 
the cryptocurrency trading business; it is believed that the most important factor 
that defines success is value. Keys to success include;

§ Aggressive targeted digital marketing and advertising.
§ Recruitment of experienced and committed workforce. 
§ Lowering overall costs.
§ To become an active and ethical member of the cryptocurrency community.
§ To build and maintain a high reputation for excellence in the industry. 
§ Availability of trained, enthusiastic, passionate and knowledgeable personnel 

with answers to financial trading needs.
§ BITXOXO to increase success rate through adherence to strategic plans, 

effective communication, customer satisfaction and management of financial 
plans in accordance with its corporate goals.

Page 10

revenues will be put back into the business with the purpose of strengthening 
the business activities of BITXOXO for high patronage and improved market 
reach.

referral marketing.

CORPORATE STRATEGY

SWOT ANALYSIS

The strategies and initiatives discussed throughout this document have been 
developed with these challenges in mind.
 
Lack of brand recognition is a problem that all new companies face, but 
BITXOXO's management believes that this obstacle can be overcome through 
aggressive marketing and networking activities.

Regarding (lack of) awareness about cryptocurrency, as part of its marketing 
efforts, the Company is planning on actively promoting the benefits of 
cryptocurrency as a core strategy.  In particular, it will participate in National 
and International conferences and enlist public relations firms to generate press 
about the importance of cryptocurrencies in the future economy.

Page 12

BITXOXO forecast its strength as the ability to respond quickly and positively to 
market demands. In addition to this, through a visible and dynamic marketing 
effort, accompanied by the effective management system, BITXOXO intends to 
become a force to reckon with in the cryptocurrency market.

In particular, the Company's skilled management team and world renowned 
Advisory Board will be instrumental in guiding the Company towards maximum 
profitability and attracting exceptional talent to work for BITXOXO.

In spite of these advantages, the Company must overcome inherent weaknesses 
and respond to potential threats in order to realize its goals.



While limited resources will force the Company to make many di�cult decisions, 
the fact of the matter is that establishing a straight up sales organization, when 
managed by seasoned experts, is a relatively conservative proposition.  In other 
words, the Company will only entertain business lines that it has the resources to 
support fully.  Moreover, sales force growth will be closely tied to market 
considerations in order to minimize risk at all times. At the same time, the 
Company will spend its marketing budget in a manner that maximizes revenue 
impact.

The Company greatly aware of its competitors, including other popular Bitcoin 
and cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses. Since other firms already offer 
cryptocurrencies as part of their product portfolios, they are natural threats and 
could become especially threatening, were they to focus on similar strategy to 
establish in the segment before BITXOXO establishes itself in the market. That 
having been said, by the time BITXOXO registers on the competition's radar, it will 
likely be cash flow positive, with its brand awareness campaign well underway. In 
the unlikely event that well-funded competitors happen to move into the sleep 
segment at the same time as BITXOXO, the Company should be able to operate 
profitably based on its cost advantages and expertise.

Even if economic and political climate does not continue as forecasted, there will 
continue to be demand for cryptocurrencies throughout the world. Based on our 
estimates, BITXOXO could still operate profitably in a zero growth scenario. What's 
more, BITXOXO has contingency plans to expedite its expansion to other regions, 
many of which support significantly higher price points than other countries. 
  
In the unlikely event that if one of the founder(s)or other key executives are forced 
to leave BITXOXO, the company will continue to pursue its business without 
detour. Fortunately, due to the vast experience and size of the Advisory Board, 
there will always be an ample supply of expert insiders ready to perform 
managerial functions when needed.

The table summarizes the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 
threats (SWOT).  As noted in the table, BITXOXO is fortunate to have formidable 
strengths and glowing opportunities.

Bitxoxo launched country's first ICO Launchpad service for it users and ICO/Pre-
ICO blockchain projects. Through Bitxoxo's ICO Launchpad, our users can invest 
into ICO's listed on our ICO Launchpad. These ICO are selected and shortlisted by 
our team of Blockchain and cryptocurrency experts. We only select those projects 
which may have high future potentials and having team fully dedicated towards 
their project. Also we scrutinize the technology and available codebase, as well as 
project maturity and progress. Furthermore, we utilize industry leading advisers 
and aggregate data sources to further evaluate the core components of what 
makes a successful project before, during, and after the token sale. 

Currently, only Indian users who have KYC verified account on Bitxoxo.com can 
invest in the listed ICOs on our Launchpad using their Bitxoxo's Balance. But very 
soon users around the globe can invest into ICOs on our ICO Launchpad. We are 
currently developing a system to integrate a more wholesome and wide-ranging  
KYC and Anti-Money Laundering safeguards so that international users can also 
use our platform to contribute in live ICOs. 

Not only users but our ICO Launchpad made fundraising simpler for blockchain 
projects. As all the contributors on Bitxoxo already holds KYC verified accounts, so 
it skips the whitelisting process which is very di�cult to manage in most of the 
ICOs. Bitxoxo also markets the ICOs listed on its launchpad to more than 100,000+ 
Bitxoxo.com subscribers as well as advertise it on all its partner websites having 
more than 10 million impressions per day.
