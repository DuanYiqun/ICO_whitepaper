“The blockchain has become a host to a 
variety of digital assets, with more being 

created every month. Soon, thousands of 
assets will be tokenized and moved onto 

this open financial network. 

As the token space continues to develop, the need to have a 

professional infrastructure for the publishing of ICOs has become 

necessary. The main challenges for an ICO infrastructure will be 

similar to those in IPO or venture funding — reliability, safety, comfort 

for the user and effectiveness for the clients. 

These main challenges are addressed in our TokenDesk project and I 

truly believe that our team has all the knowledge and experience to 

develop TokenDesk into the best ICOs direct marketplace platform in 

the cryptocurrency community.” 

Gintaras Tamosiunas, CEO of TokenDesk



Vision 
Even though the market for ICOs is expanding every month, there is still no direct way to purchase ICO 

tokens through a single platform. We have therefore decided to create a solution that will benefit investors 

interested in finding all ICOs listed in one place, as well as getting expert help to evaluate the ICOs, and 

offering the possibility to buy tokens via a one-click payment. Cryptocurrencies have given us an opportunity 

to invest in new products and ideas in a safer, more reliable and faster way. 

TokenDesk will be the biggest direct marketplace for all ICOs that are published. The possibility to buy 

tokens directly via one marketplace will not only attract investors, but publishers as well. We have set the 

goal of publishing more than 150 ICOs in 2017-2018 and of reaching up to $288 mln in funding. 

We believe that our integrated wallet solution will become the main tool not only for experiencied 

cryptocurrency investors, but also for those with a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies, blockchain 

system and services, and no previous experience of paticipating in ICO. 

Investors will be satisfied by having all the information about their investments in one place, by being able to 

analyze the statistics provided, to convert any currency in an easier way, to track their returns, discounts and 

bonuses. 

ICO Industry Trends 

ICOs have experienced a significant rate of growth in 2014-2016, with the overall funding rising from $26 to 

$222 million. One of the very first ICOs, Mastercoin, has managed to secure $5 million worth of Bitcoins. 

Subsequently, many other tech companies have followed Mastercoin’s model. In mid-August, 2017, there 

were 157 raised ICOs and more than $2.1 billion had been spent on funding. 

According to the State of Blockchain, Q1, 2017 that was published by Coindesk, ICOs and token sales 

currently capture a third of VC funding with major growth anticipated in the near future. New structures of 

ICOs are continuing to emerge as early stage fundraising mechanisms are spawned by the blockchain 

technology. Just as new ICOs are emerging every day, the incumbent enterprises are becoming more active 

in moving to blockchains, while token sales are starting to challenge traditional VC funding. 

The ICO market is growing exponentially, with $168 million in crowdfunding resulting in a market 

capitalization of $4.5 billion. Forbes

The time during which an ICO will accept funds from backers has been dropping rapidly, with the most popular 

ICOs receiving their allotted funds in hours, if not minutes. Forbes 

ICOs Worldwide 

According to Coinschedule, ICOs are totally on fire. At least double the number of ICOs available since 2016 

will be released in the next few months.  

�  

Problems 
ICOs are a fascinating new trend within the startup world. Yet, there is currently no common agreement 

about publishing certain types of information on an ICO platform. Consequently, it is problematic to 

distinguish between appropriate information and scams. 

Countless websites appear very similar to advertising pages rather than qualified investment platforms. 

Likewise, there is no technological solution that offers the option to buy a company’s tokens directly. This 

brings us to the following problem: investing in ICOs is still a complicated process where investors need to 

absorb a multitude information and delve deeply into the details about diverse types of ICOs. 

Besides this, investors are obliged to open numerous types of token wallets and to exchange 

cryptocurrencies into the acceptable altcoins. Finally, investors need to go back to the ICO website, find the 

altcoins wallet address and fill in a number of special forms. 

This procedure is too difficult to be effective in the acquisition of tokens, especially if an investor wants to 

participate in more than one ICO. An even more complicated procedure is involved in token sales.

Solutions 

�  
We have created TokenDesk in order to make the acquisition of tokens easier, faster and more reliable. The 

platform provides a solution that allows investors to choose an ICO according to the TokenDesk investors 

and advisors rating system and to purchase the tokens directly through an integrated software solution. 

TokenDesk provides the solution to purchase tokens in a reliable, fast and comfortable manner by offering 

an integrated wallet despite using many different ones.  

TokenDesk offers an effective ICO search system, easily understandable categorization, profound 

information on the distribution of tokens, an executive team, and website analyses to help investors find the 

best ICOs that are fit for their needs.  

TokenDesk’s team of experts take into account all the information that is available to provide a ranking 

system that ensures investors will be comfortable with the data needed to make a decision.

Integrated Token Wallets 

After registering at TokenDesk, integrated wallet is prepared for the investor to start trading. A token wallet is 

a technical solution that anables the investor to purchase the token directly from the platform by a one-click 

payment. 

All investor’s wallets that have been used before (ETH, Wave, NEM) are integrated into the TokenDesk wallet 

and no additional actions are required to complete the payment. In cases where the investor doesn’t yet have 

ETH or Wave wallets, the platform will open these for the investor automatically. 

�  

All Payment Methods 

Tokens are purchased only in several specified currencies (BTC and ETH, or BTC and Waves, etc.). 

Unfortunately, an investor needs to exchange the currency every time in order to purchase a specified token 

in a specified currency. That’s why the TokenDesk team has decided to find a technical solution to make 

these payments easier, faster and safer. 

TokenDesk platform will accept the biggest range of payment methods: more than 10 different altcoins may 

be used straight after the platform’s release; while the beta version will provide for as many as 30 different 

altcoins. In addition, will accept all the most popular Fiat payment methods like PayPal, MasterCard and 

Visa, Wire transfers, etc.

Ratings System 

As the cryptocurrency market is rapidly growing, the nuber of scam projects increases. This has led to a need 

to implement an ICO ratings system. The TokenDesk ratings system will compare all the different ICOs and 

decide which ones can be trusted more than others. Every ICO that is published on the platform will be 

examined by both the platform advisors and the token holders. 

The composition of the TokenDesk ratings system: 

• Background of ICO team members and executives  
The trustworthiness of the team members is proven by their previous experience, past projects, 

know-how in finished tech projects and the cryptocurrency industry, and their activities in social 

media networks.  

• Product idea —create creativity and reliability  
Issues that are analyzed include the product’s maturity level, technology, design, concept of the 

project idea, the product roadmap, and a competitive analysis. 

• Whitepapers  
How relevant is the white paper, and what information is provided in it? Is there enough 

information to gain a full picture of the company? 

• Business strategy, scalability & finance 
These aspects are examined on the basis of the short-term and long-term market potential, 

number of the existing user base, current investments, the valuation and token distribution 

showing the market cap and the transmission process, and the pricing of the tokens. 

• ICO development plans and the legal aspects  
Is the team prepared to launch a successful ICO campaign? 

The legal structure, availability to adapt to changing regulation policies, security, and escrow are 

analyzed.

Main Components of 
the Solution 
Database and Web Services 

A PostgreSQL database management system (DBMS) has been used. Web services were implemented by 

using an ASP.NET Core. This is a new iteration of the ASP.NET framework from Microsoft. Our team 

members have been running solutions based on this framework in other projects since its release in 2016. 

The framework works as a thin REST API wrapper on top of the components that contain integration and 

business specific logic. It acts as an intermediary between them and the frontend applications. 

Blockchain Solutions 

The main advantages for using a blockchain in our platform development was its durability, reliability and 

longevity. Due to the decentralized networks, the blockchain solution does not have a central point of failure 

and is better able to withstand malicious attacks. Because of this, the TokenDesk platform will keep all of its 

assets on the blockchain. We have decided to store all non-Fiat user assets in individual blockchain 

addresses. This results in Transparency (as each user will be able to check the assets that we hold for them 

using external blockchain explorer tools) and Security (since the assets will not be pooled into a few large 

accounts, we will be able to have more fine-tuned control over the private keys). 

Custom tokens will be used from at least 3 blockchains. So far, support for Ethereum, NEM and Waves has 

been planned. The TokenDesk platform will automatically create addresses for all the supported blockchains 

as soon as the user signs up. The user will instantly be able to view these addresses and to share them with 

others in order to receive coins. 

Our main goal is to make the service both secure and easy to use. Below, more information about how this 

will be implemented is presented. 

Security 

The blockchain altCoins are stored inside the blockchain — a shared record which every part of the network 

uses. This is why you don’t need to have your wallet opened in order to receive coins. The shared record of  

the ownership is simply updated to reflect the fact that you own them. This shared record is called the 

blockchain.  Every address has a private key that is created at the same time as the address itself. 

�10

http://ASP.NET
http://ASP.NET


Multi-signature Keys 

Each of our users will be able to opt-in to receive a multi-signature account. In this case, they will receive an 

access code that will not be stored on the TokenDesk servers. This setup composed of private keys will only 

make the service more secure. To make this functionality available on blockchains where a true multi-

signature is not supported, we will derive the private keys from two parts, one of which will be provided by 

the user. 

Two Factor Authentication Process 

A two factor authentication process will improve the security by combining something that you have in your 

possession (a code generated from an app or a hardware device) with something that you know (your 

passphrase). TokenDesk will also allow its users to protect their account using Universal Second Factor 

(U2F) devices such as YubiKey, Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets. 

Integrated Wallets 

Every token account holder has its own wallet address for each altcoin. Once the registration process has 

been completed, the investor will receive his own unique client number that is dedicated to his wallet 

address. Token wallets addresses are automatically dedicated in the same way as altcoin wallet addresses. 

All information in the token holder’s account is integrated and easy for users to use. Additionally, all of the 

registration procedures are integrated in one signing up process. 

Marketing 
Marketing is one of the most important factors for a successful ICO, and for attracting potential customers 

later on. TokenDesk’s strategy for attracting ICOs and investors will involve a combination of traditional and 

guerrilla marketing approaches. 

Public Relations 

Ensuring good public relations is the first and main target that the TokenDesk team will have to address. The 

target will be to generate as much media coverage about the company as is possible, particularly with regard 

to its results and success stories. TokenDesk aims to position as a reputable service and a major influencer 

of ICO related businesses and topics. 

�11



This will lead to the brand recognition by the wider public. TokenDesk wants to attract not only those who 

already know a lot about cryptocurrencies, ICOs, etc., but also those who have very little knowledge in this 

area, especially the technical field, but who would still like to participate in an investment in a particular ICO.  

TokenDesk already has databases of a variety of journalists involved in the technology, fintech, startups, and 

cryptocurrencies fields. Besides this, TokenDesk is working on building personal connections with the top 

thinkers and leaders of the industry.  

Defined target media outlet groups: 

1. Cryptocurrency and ICO related media outlets 

2. High authority media outlets that have sections or have included previous articles about 

cryptocurrency 

3. Tech/innovation/startups and their related media outlets 

4. Local media outlets 

5. Media outlets related to the target market 

Defined potential media angles: 

1. What is TokenDesk – what is the idea and the vision behind it? 

2. Success stories of ICOs that have raised money through TokenDesk 

3. Success stories of investors in ICOs through TokenDesk 

4. Tips and advice for those who want to create an ICO 

Besides reaching out to journalists, the marketing team will work with influencers from the tech, 

cryptocurrencies and many other industries to gain positive reviews. At first, self-determined people will be 

used for the endorsement, as the biggest priority is to engage as much as possible with an intake that is as 

little as possible.  

Social Media 

1. Social media will help the company to engage with existing customers, and to build a profile online. 

The TokenDesk marketing team plans to: 

2. Make regular posts: twice a week, both at the same time of day. 

3. Use social media tools to increase our reach, number of followers, and their level of engagement. 

4. Run promotions/contests across a range of social media channels. 

5. After a new ICO or a partner has joined us, we will encourage them to make posts about the 

partnership in all social media accounts.

Examples of posts: 

1. New ICOs, successful milestones, and funding targets reached.  

2. Features/updates. 

3. Blog posts.

Financial Aspects 
The cryptocurrency market has grown from 400 mln USD in 2016 to 2.1 bln USD in mid-August 2017. It is the 

experts’ prognoses that the ICO market will grow by up to four times annually.

Budget Breakdown 

For the development of the TokenDesk platform we need to raise at least 50,000 ETH or have 5,000,000 TDS 

tokens sold. This investment is needed in order to develop the TokenDesk platform with the minimal 

features. For the beta version and the implementation of the maximum features TokenDesk will need at least 

100,000 ETH raised or 20,000,000 TDS tokens sold. 

If we don’t reach the minimal investment amount, TokenDesk will return all investments to the backers by 

January 1st, 2018. 

�  

Pricing 

At TokenDesk, every ICO listed will be charged an operational fee ranging from 3.5% to 10%. Additional 

income will be generated from advertising positions. In the project development period (2017_2018) the 

advertisement packages will be expanded to appear on Twitter, Facebook, Google AdWords, Reddit and 

others.

platform with relatively positive results, TokenDesk platform has not been fully developed and finalized 

and is subject to further changes, updates, and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result 

�24



in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, possibly failing to meet users’ 

preconceived expectations based on the beta version, and hence, impact its success. For the foregoing 

or any other reason, the development of the TokenDesk platform and the launch of the future TokenDesk 

business lines may not be completed, and there is no assurance that it will ever be launched at all. The 

funds raised in the ICO are exposed to risks of theft. The Company will make every effort to ensure that

is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, sophisticated 

cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, in the smart contract(s) on the Ethereum or any 

other blockchain, or otherwise. In such event, even if the ICO is completed, the Company may not be able 

to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and TokenDesk may not be able to use such funds for the 

development of the TokenDesk platform. In such case, the launch of the TokenDesk platform and the 

structuring and licensing of the TokenDesk future business lines might be temporarily or permanently 

curtailed. 

11. Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing business and operations associated with 

cryptocurrencies throughout the world, therefore regulatory measures, investigations, or actions may 

impact TokenDesk business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the future. All

may change or need to be modified due to the regulatory and compliance requirements from any

slowdown in trading and usage of the TokenDesk platform and may delay or cancel the structuring and 

launch of the anticipated TokenDesk future business lines.
