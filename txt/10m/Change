As a customer-first company, Change is 
constantly adapting and learning from our 
users. We follow a build-measure-learn 
methodology based on validated learning, 
which entails shipping fast, getting customer 
feedback, and iterating. We prioritise 
ruthlessly between and within projects to 
deliver the maximum possible value to 
customers at all times. As a result, the 
roadmap below is indicative. It relies heavily 
on what we learn from our customers and 
might therefore take a different course over 
the next few years.

The highlighted features are expected to be 
delivered in Q1 2018.

Take the example of Lending Club, a billion dollar company that specializes in bringing together 
creditworthy borrowers and savvy investors. Lending Club is able to facilitate loans at a faster 
speed and a lower cost when compared to banks. Another example is Smartly, a Singapore-
based robo-advisor that uses algorithms to create personalized investment portfolios consisting 
of stocks, bonds, real estate, and gold. These state-of-the-art portfolios cost a fraction of 
existing solutions and allow users to invest as little as 50 dollars.
