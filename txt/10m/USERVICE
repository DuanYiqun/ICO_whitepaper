Introduction

Uservice Project is a Decentralized Online Platform based on the Ethereum blockchain 
which will use smart-contract. Ethereum technology allows registering any deals and 
operations with automobiles on a distributed contract basis like Blockchain without using 
standard legal procedures. All operations with cars will be clear, controllable and safe. 

Uservice System is intended not only for registering operations and deals between drivers 
and car service stations. It represents a basis of a brand new ecosystem which consists of 
driver service, statistical data compilation and analysis, and creation of new business 
processes in automotive industry. For example, drivers, dealers, insurance companies, car 
service stations, auto groups and digital solution providers can connect to the System and 
offer their services, which will increase blockchain value. 

www.Uremont.com is a basic product of Uservice Team and is ready-to-use IT platform for 
collecting, analyzing and building the rating system and for identifying car service stations. 

www.uremont.com raised investments for 10,000,000 US dollars, was tested and won the 
competitive struggle on seed markets and became the most significant aggregator of car 
service stations in Europe, and currently it is ready to be scaled globally and to explode its 
global market share. 

www.Uremont.com will be the basis for the new Uservice Blockchain Platform.

Uservice Team is concerned about the grade of environment pollution resulted by industrial 
productions as well as progressing growth of hazardous substances impact from vehicle 
operation and service.

In due course, the Uservice Project is expected to be presented in the majority of countries 
and we will monitor our partners’ activities and create all the necessary functionality to 
provide appropriate recycle of automotive waste products according to European 
standards. 
In order to achieve these goals we consult our project details with WWF organization.



UST Token

By incorporating an internal UST token into our ecosystem we created the mechanism of 
the community participants’ cooperation under the common platform rules.

Token Rate
UST tokens will be issued in a selected number during token sale. We expect that the 
number of participants in our platform will be growing, and as a result we will have UST 
token cost increase (because UST token uses disinflation model to work). 

UST tokens will allow you to:
1. Make payments inside Uservice community
2. Exchange UST tokens into USX tokens (for details please see “USX Token”)

UST token will be used inside Uservice ecosystem. The cooperation between the 
community participants inside our platform will be based on this token usage.

co-owners of Uservice. The USX token holders will be provided with 20% of share in 
Uservice Company.

USX token will be created only under favorable legal terms for its legitimate acceptance as 
a crypto-value security in Uservice Company seat of business jurisdiction.

Token exchange
* UST and USX token exchange will take place inside Uservice platform at any time with 
no fee charged.
* UST token can be sold/purchased on the major crypto-currency exchanges

Entry points

The Uservice strategy of global market coverage starts with the most comfortable entry 
points. This way business start, testing and the beginning of global service deployment 
commence in the most preferential region with minimal costs and maximally quick 
growth potential. Among the criteria for choosing the countries were market potential and 
organization, legislative aspects, mobile communication penetration and other conditions. 

Initially we chose markets of Eastern Europe, Asia, America and Middle East as the entry 
points and global service deployment. Operational activity and work under full potential 
has already been launched in Eastern Europe, where www.uremont.com platform has 
become the most significant car service aggregator.

Agenda

No Transparency Between Market Participants 
This problem was explained by George Akerlof, economist and the Nobel prizewinner, who 
published his scientific research “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the 
Market Mechanism”. The author described the work processes of marketplaces, where 
one side of a deal, either seller or buyer, knows about the product more than another. He 
called this “information asymmetry markets”. Used car market can serve as an example. 
When selling his/her car the seller possesses more information about the vehicle. For this 
reason buyer is afraid of being scammed and wants to minimize possible risks. Buyers 
cannot distinguish between high-quality and low-quality cars, so that is why they try to 
spend less money when buying a car. As a result an average price of a car becomes lower. 
Because of a low average price the majority of cars being sold are of low quality. This 
results in a situation when sellers of high-quality cars leave the market.

The Uservice Platform will solve this problem by providing both sides of a deal with the 
same level of information about the market situation in general and about specific deals in 
particular.

Disorganized Market of Car Services
Unlike Uber on taxi services marketplace, car services market is not automated globally 
yet. The majority of car service stations work as they used to: human factor plays the 
most significant role. There is one and the same scenario in every city: you have to spend 
your precious time analyzing car service stations while searching for the most satisfying 
options.  

We created Uservice in order to change this approach.  

No Mobile Solutions
Today people strive to save their time. That is why they try using mobile applications in all 
situations. In this light Uber is a global standard. We see our task in creating a product 
which can provide a driver with all functional options during the entire period of car 
owning. 



Inadequate Data Analysis
Information is gold worthy. This formula was stated in an annual report devoted to the 
increased digitalization and automation in automotive industry by KMPG (LINK) Audit 
Agency, Switzerland. In deed modern cars can be called “Information Generators”. 
Vehicles are equipped with a lot of sensors, detectors, monitors and cameras which are 
constantly collecting and analyzing information. This information can represent car 
location, details damage and wear degree, internal breakdowns, etc. Car manufacturers, 
insurance companies, banks, etc. can gain a lot of benefits from such data. Uservice will 
improve efficiency of collecting and analyzing bigdata in automotive industry

Payments Security
Using the organized system of payments to the service makers in any city of the world 
which is connected to the system, the application equipped with the decentralized 
blockchain technology allows making a secured payment with complete fulfillment of the 
obligations guaranteed. 

Spare Parts and Accessories: Search, Pricing and Delivery
Many drivers prefer buying spare parts or accessories by themselves. However it is quite 
often that the driver experiences certain problems selecting the correct parts for his/her 
car depending on modification and year of manufacture. 

With Uservice drivers can find the required spare parts under the best price, choose the 
most convenient delivery option, make order and complete purchase easily and quickly! It 
is safe and trustworthy! According to this approach, Uservice registered car service 
station or retail/wholesale seller can be the supplier. Buyer may effect the payment using 
his/her tokens.

No Transparent and Clear Rating System Based On Customer 
Satisfaction Feedbacks
Uservice Platform will contain rating of community participants based on customer 
feedbacks. The blockchain will give the participants their opportunity to check steps of 
rating formation which makes this process most precise and impartial.



Solution

The Uservice Platform solves the above problems through the single Global Blockchain 
Platform, which associates drivers, dealers, insurance companies, car service stations, 
auto groups and part distributors. By connecting to our platform they obtain the 
opportunity to cooperate, thereby increasing the transparency and efficiency of their 
business processes.

Eventually the platform will combine the marketplace participants of waterborne and air

The Uservice Platform applies blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart-contract. 
Blockchain provides total operating activity awareness of company. 

The entire program interface is being developed to integrate feasible business processes 
into our platform. 

Blockchain technology will provide an opportunity to store and analyse large volumes of 
data, as well as to create clear and open history of car operations. 

Based on our successful www.uremont.com product and the blockchain technology, the 
new Uservice Platform will make life of its participants easier, more convenient and safe.

From the manufacturer to the car owner - the Uservice system will get rid of counterfeit 
products in the spare parts market.

The main goal of the Uservice platform is to solve all the issues that the car owners face, 
while using the car. Naturally, one of the most important directions of the project 
development is the supply and purchase of spare parts. As in many other industries, when 
buying parts, there is a great risk of purchasing an unauthentic spare part, which is very 
difficult to distinguish from the original. The car is an expensive purchase, the prices for 
the spare parts are also quite high, and that’s why the industry of producing copies and 
substitutes for spare parts in this area is very developed. 

What makes the spare parts market different is the difficulty of evaluation due to the high 
proportion of counterfeit products.

A large part of the market is made of counterfeit products, as well as unauthentic parts 
produced without a license - their number in the total volume, according to experts, is 
about 70%. The volume of counterfeit parts is only about one third of the market volume. 
These are consumables and inexpensive parts - brake pads, filters, oils and suspension 
parts. 

The problem of checking every spare part and guaranteed confirmation of its originality, 
can be solved by using a blockchain. Individual identifier, all the information about the 
operations and movements of each part can be recorded in one system, automatically. 
Moreover, they will be preserved and protected based on the logic of building a 
decentralized model for the transmission and storage of information.

As a result, when you are buying an oil filter from the Mercedes, you no longer wonder - is 
it actually produced in a Mercedes factory, or is it just a fake, that you can’t distinguish 
from an authentic spare part. 

Uservice blockchain will give each detail a unique code and trace its path from the 
manufacturer to the car owner. The system will confirm the authenticity of every detail, 
check on which car it is installed in and how much it has served.

The system will also take into account the number of transactions and set the extra 
charge on each spare part.

Monetization Model

The Monetization Model of the Project is completely intelligible.

Current Uremont Business Model 

The commission level is calculated on the basis of charging zones, which characteristics 
are determined through marketing researches in a particular region and are unified within 
each specific region, which makes it possible for the customers to always be sure that they 
receive a service at the most favorable price. 

The funds raised during the token sale and the blockchain technology itself will give the 
opportunity to significantly expand the ways of product monetizing by involving various 
participants of the automotive industry in our ecosystem community.

Token sale

The Key Differences of Our Token Sale
1. The Uservice Project is being built up based on the existing business
According to our data about 80% of all token sale are just concepts which can never be 
realized. Only 20% of the startups which began token sale campaigns are able to present 
the actual product to customers. Investing in startups which are not enforced with the 
existing solutions is a highly risky venture.
   
The Uservice is being built up based on the existing www.uremont.com project, which 
demonstrates highly dynamic marketing expansion. Therefore Uservice is committed to 
provide our community and its participants with the most favorable terms for cooperation 
and profit earning as a part of its financial policy.

2. Large Investors Have Trust In Us
Nakamoto Capital investment fund, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and other 
institutional investors have expressed their consent to begin investing in our Project 
during the token sale phase.

The Token Sale Process
During token sale UST tokens will be available at fixed rate. We expect to issue 
1,000,000,000 UST tokens in total. 56% of them will be available for sale during the token 
sale, and 4% will be sold during the Pre-Sale. 

Out of the remaining 40% of tokens, 10% will be shared between the team members, 20% 
of tokens will be used to support platform operation, and the remaining 10% will be 
distributed between our advisers and participants of our Bounty program.

UST token is based on the Ethereum Platform and the ERC20 Token Standard Interface. 

ERC 20 Interface allows every token sale participant to use any Ethereum Client (eg. Mist 
or MyEtherWallet)

Risk to have no support from drivers and 
project partners

The business model is tested. The project received favorable customer 
feedbacks. More than 30% of drivers file repeated applications for car 
repairs, 95% of drivers provide positive feedbacks about using the 
platform. 

Team risks Uncoordinated actions of independent developer teams at parallel stages 
and unsuccessful efforts coordination when achieving a common goal 
of the project.

Measures: Single project team, creation of the project flow chart, and 
control over the possibility of combining the results of their activities into 
a single technology based on the results of the whole project.

Technology risks Risks applying unproven technologies and techniques, and 
non-compliance with established regulations and codes.

Measures: Creation of the project flow chart, involving the external 
adviser. Using only those technologies which are actually proven to work 
successfully.



Data sheet

Version 0.6
UST Token
Smart contract address: https://github.com/devuservice/TokenSale
Token launch:  Nov-21-2017 17:39:45

Uservice is created on the basis of ETH blockchain, according to the ERC-20 
specification.

The total number of tokens is limited to 1 billion tokens.

Tokens are nominal and are minted address, i.e. at any moment of time, the token has 
an owner (investor's wallet). Tokens are public and fully comply with the ERC 20 
standard. 

The UST Tokens were generated by publishing on the ETH blockchain network, the name 
of the contract ManagedToken, on the compiler version v0.4.16 + commit.d7661dd9.
All tokens remaining after this phase of the project will be destroyed.
Ethereum is a public computing blockchain platform with an open source code, with the 
functionality of smart contracts (scripts). It provides a decentralized virtual Turing 
machine, an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) that can run scripts using an international 
network of public nodes. Ethereum also provides a crypto-token called "ether", which can 
be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participating nodes for the 
calculations performed. "Gas", the internal mechanism of transaction pricing, is used to 
reduce the amount of spam and resource allocation in the network. 

Funds safety 
The platform employees do not have access to users’ wallets, including wallets with 
tokens. Funds collected by campaigns and located on their unique walltes are controlled 
automatically by the platform. 

During the ICO, before transferring funds to wallets, users manage tokens in their wallets 
in their usrv.io accounts. 
 
To ensure security, double confirmation of possession of wallets is used.

Generation and emission of Uservice are also carried out automatically and only after 
confirmation of receipt of funds on the unique campaign wallets from backers, be it ETH 
or BTC.



User Security
Only owners of the wallets have the access to their wallets.  Passwords to accounts are 
not saved on the website, for a fast login, hashing is used. Users can both store 
passwords for their wallets on the platform, or delete them for security reasons. In this 
case, with each transfer of funds, the user must enter the password from his wallet, which 
is not saved on the Uservice platform.

Links to user profiles in social networks, emails and other contact details are shown only 
to the owners of accounts and are not visible to other users.

Only moderators of the platform and the top developers have access to links to user 
profiles, as well as access to their contact information. Moderators do not have access to 
user wallets, their identifiers or passwords. 

Privacy
Transactions made by users are recorded in the system and encrypted. User wallets are 
also encrypted on the platform and any association with player profiles is maximally 
leveled. Any connection of wallets with users of the platform (except for authors) is not 
available to anyone except the developers of the Uservice platform. This is necessary to 
resolve disputes or respond to user questions in case they arise. 

In order to ensure the safety of backers and investors, authors who raise funds on the 
Uservice platform must be public and provide backers with information about themselves. 
While the campaign, of which he is an author, is active, they can't enable anonymous 
mode. After the campaign is completed, the author can enable anonymous mode, but in 
completed (including canceled) campaigns, the public information of the authors, which 
was specified at the time of the launch of the campaign, will be displayed.

All personal data of users, including passwords, emails and all identifiers of wallets, are 
encrypted. This protects Uservice users from hacking or leaking information. Even in the 
worst scenario, user data, passwords and wallets will remain safe, and no access or 
money transfers from them can be made. 



System Architecture Overview
As shown below, the Uservice project consists of 3 layers of software, responsible for 
different aspects:

Ethereum Network
Network Infrastructure
Data Persistence Level
Check/execution of contract logic
Executing Transactions

Smart contract in Uservice

Token launch algorithm
Account balance database
Transaction rules

Wallet software 
1. The user interface
2. Business logic for the token users 
3. Create a transaction

Network Interaction Model
The Ethereum network provides an environment for interaction between companies and 
users in the ecosystem of Uremont / Uservice. The parties interact by sending 
transactions to the Uservice contract. All transactions are checked by the business logic 
of the contract and are saved on the blockchain. The contract API is open to everyone on 
the Internet, and anyone can become a user of the Uservice token.
