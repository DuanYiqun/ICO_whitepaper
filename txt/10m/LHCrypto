LHCoin utility token function 
and usage for traders 

LHCoin (or #LHC) is an ERC-20 utility token based on ETHEREUM; it was 

created by Larson&Holz company for LH-CRYPTO.1O project. 

Token address: 

0x0778Cc2E8bBAd3d483E82371606D100cc8604522 

Emission: 

72 min tokens were emitted for the crowdsale and extra 30 min tokens were 
emitted for LH-Crypto team and for marketing. 

Token Function: 

#LHC is the company's means of payment, clients can exchange tokens for 
premium services. Also, LHC tokens can be used by the company's 
representatives as the lump sum (one-time payment for the right to offer the 
company's services and receive commission in return). 

Offered services: 

LH-CRYPTO is a cryptobroker which will allow clients to make deals with trading 
instruments on FOREX. CFDs and cryptocurrencies markets using margin 
trading. 

Margin trading is a type of service provided by a broker company to its clients. It 
enables them to make buy-or-sell deals on trading instruments for the sums by 
scores higher than the client's own funds. Yet there is no direct supply of this 
trading instrument. This operation is aimed at making profit from the trading 
asset price fluctuations. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

See more on margin trading here: 
https:// en. wikiped ia .org/wiki/Margin_(finance)] 

Therefore the main product offered by LH-CRYPTO is online 

trading with margin leverage for retail customers. 

Reference note: 

Margin leverage is the proportion of client's own funds to the amount provided by the broker 

company for trading. Leverage rate is 1:100 or higher for high-liquidity markets or 1 :1 for 

exotic markets and spots markets. High leverage deals are most appealing for traders. 



Let's Look in detail into each of these options. 

1.Premium Margin Leverage monthly fee

LH-CRYPTO will offer premium leverage for its clients on a reimbursable basis. 

The fee for higher leverage will be collected in tokens every month. 

Preliminary PRICE LIST for higher (premium) Leverage service: 

LEVERAGE 

DEPOSIT 1 :10 1 :50 1:700 

<0,1 BTC 0 #LHC / MONTHLY 0 #LHC / MONTHLY 0 #LHC / MONTHLY 

0,1 = 1 BTC 0 #LHC / MONTHLY 100 #LHC / MONTHLY 300 #LHC / MONTHLY 

> 1 BTC 0 #LHC / MONTHLY 500 #LHC / MONTHLY 1000 #LHC / MONTHLY 

2.Premium Margin Leverage monthly fee

At the final stage of the project, when the token liquidity rate is high enough and 

its price on exchanges is stable, #LHC will be accepted by the broker as margin 

requirement. In other words, clients can transfer #LHC to their trading accounts 

and make deals for the whole range of trading instruments in return. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

3.Lump sum from company's partners

In online trading, brokers have a wide network of representatives who attract 

clients. Broker's representatives are individuals and entities that attract new 

clients for the broker and receive commission for each deal of these clients. After 

the agreement is signed, every representative is granted with a special 

registration code, Personal Area and a right to use the brand. This right is usually 

purchased for a one-time payment to the broker - a lump sum. 

Preliminary PRICE LIST for the right to use the brand and to 

receive commission: 

For 1 year For 3 years For 5 years Unlimited 

Supervisor Contract 70'000 #LHC - -

Inspector Contract - 25'000 #LHC 

Provider Contract - - 35'000 #LHC

What makes 
this ICO 

different? 

The main advantage of our ICO is that it is 

based оп а business model that has 

worked for years, has proven its efficiency, 

and allows us to provide assurances to our 

investors. 

We also designed three functions enaЬling 

our investors to earn оп the #LHCoin 

tokens, and included them into the smart 

contract. These earning methods are not af­

fected Ьу the market price of the #LHCoin 

token. 

WhitePaper 5.1.

Seven unique Features 
of our project 

We already have а business model that has proven 

its efficiency. Moreover, we have а long history and 

а large client base. 

Larson&Holz is not just а web-site, it is а real com­

pany. We have been in the market since 2004; we 

have а large number of offices and partners in dif­

ferent countries of Asia, Europe and Latin America. 

Over а hundred first-rate professionals, fluent in 1 О 

languages, are employed Ьу the Company. 

ICO is designed to bring profit to project 

participants immediately after the PRE ICO stage. 

This process is called the "Early Bird Bonus". 

Our clients are active lnternet users, their financial 

resources аге limited and they look for а chance to 

earn online. Thus, the enormous cryptocurrency 

community is among our target audiences. 

We only need to adjust the efficient business-model 

and the marketing campaign to the crypto-environ­

ment. 

5.Token holders' revenue depends on the asset

market price growth and on the fixed рагt of the in­

coming funds flow to the crypto broker's account. ln 

every way this is similar to dividend payments. 

These payouts are included into the smart contract. 

This technique is called "CASHBACK".

Since we already аге an efficient and profit-making 

broker, we can provide unique bonuses for our 

token holders. The min. token yield we expect 

during the first уеаг is 20%. This is referred to as the 

"Token Rate lnsurance System".

The ways to solve 
these problems 

Cryptocurrencies and BLOCKCHAIN technologies for depositing and 

withdrawing will help the company to make mutual payments for 

clients from China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, several Arab 

countries, etc., for their Currency Laws have always been prevented 

money transfer to foreign companies and hindered the expansion of 

Forex brokers to these regions. Thus, the company will be able to open 

up a huge market interested in brokerage services. 

Launching transactions in cryptocurrencies will open doors for an 

enormous target audience which is familiar with cryptocurrencies and 

has free funds in cryptocurrencies. These people are active enough to 

take part in speculative operations and are easy to be converted into 

Forex broker's clients. 

Therefore, the project will help us to increase the client base and, con­

sequently, the company's revenues. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

The broker, who makes payments and keeps funds in cryptocurrencies will 

be able to work only in the Internet, without any physical location in any of 

the countries of his clients . This is why there is no need to acquire licens-

es, and the financial regulators' restrictions of different countries are at 

their minimum. This makes our marketing campaigns more effective en­

abling us to acquire new clients (bonus programmes, affiliate pro­

grammes, stimulating contests, etc.). 

Switching to cryptocurrencies as a means of payment will help us 

reduce the transactional expenses from 6% to 1 %.

Why do we say we are 
"THE Fl RST CRYPTO BROl<ER"? 

What is the difference between crypto broker and exchange websites 

and currency exchange offices? 

Usually a crypto broker is believed to be a simple currency ex­

change office .. This is a profitable and useful business, but 

there is nothing new about it. 

We do not create another exchange website or a currency ex­

change office. 

Our business is to provide our clients a chance to speculate on the 

exchange rate fluctuation of any financial instruments, including 

cryptocurrencies. Trading is carried out under margin conditions, so 

a client can open trades that are hundreds or thousands of times 

bigger than his or her deposit. It helps clients make considerable 

profits on small price fluctuations within minutes. 

This business is similar to gambling and is one of the most 

profitable and popular online businesses, particularly in Asia. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

Our customers are ordinary people who like playing in the 

market, they are called "traders". The number of these traders 

in the world is enormous .. 

The groups of traders and crypto currency users often overlap. 

Attracting cryptocurrencies holders to trading and, on the other 

side, offering crypto currency accounts to the acting traders will 

increase the broker's client base significantly and contribute to 

the success of the project. 

Therefore, we are simply introducing the existing 

brokerage model into the crypto environment. 



We have successfully worked 
in the market For 

All we need is a minor modernization of our software, some 

re-training for our staff and considerable marketing funds. 

Software, we already possess, accounts for 20% of the 

brokerage business,, and the remaining 80% depend on

marketing promotion.

It seems that the idea to create a crypto version of the Forex 

broker is obvious. It is simple, elegant and can be implemented 

quickly. 

However, at present not a single Forex broker has launched its 

crypto version that makes mutual payments with its clients 

only in cryptocurrencies. 

There are numerous crypto exchange sites and crypto 
�N'-JI 

exchange offices .. Attempts were made to create cryp' 

brokers for corporate clients. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

and we know how to 

make our business 

profitable. 

- Yet there is no Forex broker for retail clients that

would convert all of its operations into

cryptocurrencies.

We are the first to open crypto accounts to any 

trader with more than $10 in his or her pocket 

from any country of the world and to let this 

trader work with any financial instruments using 

all the advantages of leverage.

The reward system for investors based on the token price markup is called the "Early Bird Bonus·. 

We also care about the investors who would join us during the last week of the ICO. They will still be able to take part in the gift 

tokens distribution, which will take place separately, after the ICO is over. The amount of this gift will depend on the success of 

the ICO and the proceeds we manage to raise.

Early Bird Bonus, as well as the referral payouts in ETH, are accrued to the crowdale participant's Personal Area on our site; they 

are available after ICO ends.

How can I have a monthly income 
From brol<er's operational activity? 

What is 

CASH BACK? 

This is our "secret weapon". 

It makes our project unique and is 

connected to the specific features of our 

business. 

The funds inflow is essential for any broker 

and any Forex broker in particular. The 

incoming client inflow is made up of the 

funds transferred to the broker's accounts 

and then used for trading. 

- It is important to processed these

transactions quickly, at low cost and for all

the countries of the world.

Conventional Forex brokers accept funds in fiat money, over 90% of incoming payments to the 

broker's accounts are processed by bank card transfers. 

It is quick and easy, but there are two 

major disadvantages. 

First, in many countries there are numerous limita­

tions and restrictions on bank transfers to foreign 

brokers - in India for example. 

Second, and most important, the commission for 

such transaction is very high - usually, about 5-6%.

Transition to cryptocurrencies as a means of 
payment can solve both of these problems. 

Therefore, by switching to cryptocurrencies the broker wins 5% in comparison to the 

conventional model (minus small expenses for the peering payment system commission). 

The 5% of the incoming client payments is the instant profit from this project (there are other 

long-term benefits, such as client base increase, new trading instruments, etc.) 

·······

5% 
· · · · · · · · ·

We have decided to put these 5%, our instant income, 

into the payback pool - to distribute it among our 

investors.

Every month 5% of our client inflow is to be transferred to the 

ethereum wallets used for the ICO. We have called these payments 

the CASHBACK Program. 

This algorithm is a wonderful supplement to the profits investors will 

receive from the tokens market price appreciation; it supports the 

main profits and secures investments. 

These payments will be processed automatically every month. The 

payback scheme is included into the smart contract, is secured, and 

cannot be changed.

It is worth mentioning that these are quite large sums of money. The 

current incoming broker flow comes to around 3mlnl USO monthly. 

According to our marketers, transition to the crypto-currency model 

could help increase our clientele base at least threefold - up to 10ml 

USO. 

And upon achieving the project's full capacity, the total amount of 

payments within the CASHBACK Program should yield approx. 6ml 

USO annually (0,5 min per month).

We have set four goals: 

This is the minimal amount. lf we do not reach this point, all the money will Ье auto­

matically returned to the investors' accounts and the project will Ье suspended, for it 

would mean that the interest to the industry is low. 

This amount will allow us to launch the project according to our Roadmap. We will follow 

the Roadmap for about а year. 

With more than 1 О mln USD raised, we will Ье аЫе to shorten the launch period and will in­

crease the marketing budget, which will help us to win the bulk of the market. 

lf the investments amount to 50 mln, the further token sales will Ье suspended, for this 

amount is тоге than enough to cover any marketing expenses and will rocket the broker to 

the ТОР-5 in the shortest time possiЫe. There is no point in raising more funds than we need.

ICO procedure 

Types of tokens 

The smart contract of Larson&Holz crypto broker contains two types of tokens, 

which are equal in price at any point in time. 

___ _A_ __ _ 
( � 

# LHCoin are the tokens bought by investors*. This is the main
type of tokens. They are sold during the crowd sale. They can 

be purchased in two ways. First - automatically, by transfer­

ring ETH (ethereums) to a special wallet. In this case the smart 

contract will send the corresponding amount of #LHCoin 

tokens to the investor's wallet. The second way is to buy 

tokens using any other means of payment but ETH, for in­

stance, in bitcoins or in fiat money. In this case the smart 

token administrator transfers the tokens manually This 

method works for big investors who don't have ethereums and 

don't want to exchange them at the current price. 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

2 

# LHCoin_b are tokens distributed for BOUNTY programs, 

Fund's founding members. rewards to the staff, etc. The main 

difference from #LHCoin is that they do not enter the referral 

program during the ICO and the CASHBACK Program. In other 

words, the smart contract does not distribute ethereums to 

them as a part of the CASBACK Program before the tokens are 

introduced to the market, before December1, 2018, according 

to the Roadmap. 

However, the #LHCoin_b tokens are equal in price to #LHCoin, 

they will also be traded on the market; after the tokens are 

brought to the market. #LHCoin_b will be also included into the 

CASH BACK Program. Then once they are in the market ,both 

types of tokens will not differ fron each other. 

It is necessary to devide tokens into two types is required, be­

cause the first type of tokens is acquired by investors*. while
the second type will be given to the ICO team, who take part in 

the project but do not invest their own funds. 

26 

* investor  - ICO participant who purchases LHCoins to use them as utility tokens 
for margin trading in cryptobroker LH-Crypto.



27 

What do you need so many 
Bounty tol<ens For? 

Note that the Bounty tokens (#LHCoin_b) are emitted to pay the project team.A 

large amount of Bounty tokens will be reserved to reward the staff who will work in 

the project after the ICO. 

This is done intentionally. Apart from paying salaries in fiat money we also want to 

pay them partly in Bounty tokens. 

Bounty tokens are equal in price to investors' tokens. However, the employees will be 

able to monetize them on the market or gain income from the operational activity 

only after both types of tokens are brought to the market. 

As a result, we want to make our staff personally committed to the project success. 

If there are any ex:ra Bounty tokens the day before being brought to the market, then 

the remaining tokens will be destroyed. 

What is the tokens distribution scheme? How are we going to reward the project 

team? 

The distribution scheme works in the following way: 

70% 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

of the total amount of tokens goes on sale to investors* 
as #LHCoin; the system of monthly accruals from 

broker's operational activity (CASH BACK) will be activated 

immediately after the ICO. 

Of these 70%: 

20% is distributed during thePRE ICO; 5 0 0/ is distributed during the /0 ICO. 

30% The rest 30% of the total amount of tokens will be distributed among the project team members as #LHCoin_b. These tokens are a reward 
for individuals and entities involved into the project 

During the first year after the PRE ICO starting point #LHcoin_b are not 

exchanged for money.rather for the labour contributed. 

48 hours before the tokens are brought to market #LHCoin tokens and 

#LHCoin_b tokens are be merged together; after that there will be no 

difference between these tokens. 

#LHCoin_b structure (the percentage of the total amount of tokens, i.e. 

100 min tokens): 

6 o/c - rewarding founders.
0 Larson&Holz company; 6% 

- rewarding staff for 1 year of 

work; 

4% 

9% 

- Bounty program to stimulate

sales during the ICO;

5 % - provisions (unused tokens will be 
destroyed before the tokens are 

brough to the market). 

- distributed among the exchange markets to which #LHCoin t>kens are brought. 

We want the exchange markets. where the tokens circulate, to be the company's 

shareholders, so that they were interested in keeping the #LHCoin rate fair;

When are you planning to bring 
#LHC Tol<ens to the stocl< exchange 

We plan to sign an agreement with at least three out of 

TOP-10 stock exchanges immediately after ICO is over; 

tokens will be offered for trading at the secondary market 

within 1 to 9 months upon ICO completion. 

},% When the minimal goal is achieved - SOFT CAP, we will need more time to bring 
tokens to the exchange, since the shortage of funds will have to compensated by 
scrupulous project drafting and longer marketing campaign to ensure stable 

growth of our tokens when trading begins. 

When the Ultimate CAP goal is reached, tokens will be brought to the exchange 
within one month, thus, almost immediately. 

When the Normal CAP and Optimal CAP goals are reached 

we begin trading with #LHCoin somewhat later, within 3 to 6 

months 

WhitePaper 5.1. 

Whatever the total amount of proceeds, we devote the first month after ICO 
finishes to preparations. 

All February we will send tokens to our ICO participants. The first months after ICO 
are the time to start working on cryptobroker and adapting our software to the new 
purposes. This time is devoted totraining stuff and preparing the marketing 
campaign.

We will also start our negotiations with the world's biggest exchanges to 
list our tokens for trading.

Please remember that the exchange rate growth is not the 
main source of profit for our ICO participants. They will also 
gain CASHBACK bonuses, which do not depend on #LHCoin 
rate fluctuations. The main function of our token is to use it 
for margin trading in the future cryptobroker.

The distinctive feature of Larson&Holz 

Crypto is that, unlike many similar 

projects, it is not a start-up. 

On the contrary, it is a crypto division of an online 

business that has been working for years in a field 

close to the crypto-environment. 

Forex broker cl ents in general and Larson&Holz cli­

ents in particular are open-minded people. They 

trade on the financial market and make profits from 

minor fluctuations of prices on different financial in­

struments: shares, commodities, currencies, and 

cryptocurrencies. 

They are called traders. Traders use modern technol­

ogies and choose prompt actions, they are not afraid 

to risk their time and funds today to earn greater 

profits tomorrow. 

Conclusion 

36 

Traders community and cryptocurrencies community are overlapping; this is why we 

think that our project will attract the crypto community's attention, we expect to find new 

active clients among them. 

Our projects starts at the PRE ICO stage and will be unfolding for 2 years. In 2 years we 

expect to have a crypto broker with trade flows comparable to any of top-10 traditional 

Forex brokers such as Saxo Bank, Oanda, FXCM, etc. 

The investment process, from the PRE ICO up to the launch, is designed so that the 

inves­tors could gain profits simultaneously with the company. Along with the 

conventional profit from the asset market price growth, we have built in several functions 

to earn on our tokens; they do not depend on the token market rate and they are on from 

the very be­ginning of the CROWDSALE. These are EARLY BIRD BONUS, CASI I BACK and 

REFERRAL PROGRAMS. 

We expect our tokens to double in price during their first year on 

the market. You can check details in the section on"Seven unique 

features of our project".
