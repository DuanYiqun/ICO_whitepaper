Abstract
The Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is growing at a remarkable rate

but has become more inaccessible than ever. The requirement for large
annotated datasets and a complex technical infrastructure has driven AI
development behind the closed doors of corporations. This paper intro-
duces an open, decentralized network called Effect.AI , that provides ser-
vices in the AI market. The network replaces several existing services and
requires no fees, has a low barrier of entry and provides fast growth of
the industry. This is accomplished by three platforms that run on the NEO
blockchain and are fueled by a network token called EFX. The first platform
is a marketplace for tasks that require human intelligence. It allows any-
one in the world to perform tasks for a fair payment and gives businesses
access to a large workforce of human intelligence. The second platform is a
decentralized registry of AI services described by a rich ontology. On this
platform any algorithm can be accessed as a service in a unified manner
and has a convenient way to receive payment. The last platform provides
a decentralized, distributed computational platform that can run popular
deep learning frameworks. The effect of this network will define the future
relationship between humans and AI.

1 Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly and has already caused many

different effects. We see AI applications everywhere we look; from phones to

autonomous vehicles to biotechnology, AI has become ubiquitous. AI is often

considered the key component of the Fourth Industrial Revolution [1]. Like the

revolutions that preceded it, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the poten-

tial to raise global income levels and improve the quality of life for populations

around the world. However, the revolution could yield greater inequality as well,

particularly in its potential to disrupt labor markets as automation substitutes

labor across the entire economy [1]. Consider, for example, when entire work-

forces were laid off when pinhead factories started incorporating machines in

their fabrication process. A similar, though far larger threat looms due to new

advances in AI development. Bill Gates had the idea to tax labor performed

by AI-algorithms, to compensate for the loss of jobs in many sectors1. This

idea seemed science fiction at the time, but the concept can be realized on the

Effect Network, a decentralized network for AI. Effect.AI brings AI-algorithms

to an open and proven decentralized platform, powered by the blockchain and

accessible to all.

1.A Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized data store that can contain arbitrary logic and

processes, without the need for a trusted central party. Blockchain was first pro-

posed in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009 [2]. Since then the

technology has been applied in many areas, and has had a disruptive influence

in the markets of banking, insurance, real-estate, to name a few. Decentralized

applications have some unique properties like transparency and a fixed history.

We propose a protocol that decentralizes the global market in AI; which lowers

the barrier for entry, stimulates market growth and greatly reduces usage cost.

NEO NEO [3] is (i) the use of blockchain technology and digital identity to

digitize assets, and (ii) the use of smart contracts for digital assets to be self–

managed. This establihes, what is called, a Smart Economy with a distributed

network2. Hence, it’s a smart contracts ecosystem, similar to Ethereum [4].

NEP5 tokens are tokens that are managed by smart contracts on the NEO

blockchain. Most existing NEO projects use a NEP5 token (e.g. RedPulse3,

Qlink4, and DeepBrain Chain5). NEP5 describes the protocol that these tokens

conform to, as the Effect.AI EFX token does as well.

1.B Artificial Intelligence

AI is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the Natural Intelligence

(NI) displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI is defined

as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment

and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.

In the past five years there has been a rapid growth in the number of practical

AI applications. Smart services like self-driving cars, face and voice recognition

in mobile phones, and image translation are getting a central place in every-

day life. The increase in AI applications can be explained by the advances in

Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Pro-

cessing (NLP) research, as well as the ready availability of cloud computing.

This has resulted in large adoption by the industry and the birth of a billion-

dollar-economy around smart applications. While academic achievements are

available to the public most intelligent algorithms are developed behind the

closed doors of large corporations. We propose a private, decentralized ecosys-

tem called the Effect.AI Network (Effect Network). The network is designed

to develop in the phases shown in fig. 1, and operates fully on smart contracts

deployed on a Turing-complete blockchain.

1.C Problem Statement

Despite the advantages AI brings there are a number of problems that have to be

dealt with, especially regarding the research and development of AI technology.

These problems can broadly be categorized into three areas that currently make

AI research and development difficult to perform.

Data processing The first problem is that of data processing. Intelligent ap-

plications perform tasks that traditionally require human feedback. Such tasks

involve processing unstructured data and finding patterns that can provide use-

ful output. These applications are trained on large data sets with annotations.

Page 5



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

Obtaining an annotated data set is non-trivial and requires a lot of time and

resources.

Diverging Tasks The second problem that currently makes AI hard to practi-

tion is that of diverging tasks. An obstacle when developing a complex algorithm

is the need to interact with parts of the world outside the current domain. For

example: a self-driving car learning to steer will also need to identify road signs

around the world. This situation can best be treated as a knowledge system

where the classification of the sign is done by an external application. This

quickly increases the complexity of an application.

Computational Costs The last main problem is the computational cost of

AI algorithms. Developing and training AI systems is in most cases a computa-

tional intensive and thus expensive task. It requires a technical infrastructure

capable of processing large amounts of data, doing batched processing on Graph-

ics Processing Units (GPUs) and coordinating the results.

1.D Solution Effect.AI

A decentralized ledger like the blockchain provides a direct link between sup-

ply and demand which can greatly mitigate these problems. The transparency

that blockchain offers will boost discoverability on the network, resulting in a

high degree of collaboration and data sharing between agents. It also increases

knowledge diversity and makes AI more affordable by sharing costs. Around

this vision the Effect Network is designed. Like other decentralized applica-

tions, Effect.AI directly connects supply and demand without the need for an

intermediary party. To be more specific, the Effect Network will establish the

following:

1. Accessibility. By directly linking supply and demand through our micro-

tasking platform Effect.AI Mechanical Turk (EMT) will make training AI

algorithms easier, faster and cheaper (section 3). This will enable users

Page 6



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

who do not have access to a large dataset or a big network to train their

AI algorithm.

2. Accuracy. The Effect.AI Smart Market (ESM) is an exchange with a

rich ontology of specialist AI applications. Individual applications are

able to find each other to buy or sell information, as specified in section 4.

Through this exchange, users can use data sets with significantly higher

complexities to train their AI algorithms.

3. Performance. Users can enrich their existing datasets by purchasing

services from algorithms on the ESM (section 4), or they can setup a new

datasets by creating micro-tasks on the EMT platform (section 3). By en-

abling users to build datasets quickly and accurately they can immediately

use these datasets to train AI algorithms.

4. Interoperability. By putting the AI algorithms on the blockchain and

creating a communication standard to which these AI algorithms have

to comply to, we can truly decentralize AI and achieve interoperability

between individual AIs (section 5). The combination of multiple AI algo-

rithms will result in powerful capabilities and emergent intelligence that

no single AI algorithm can achieve on its own.

The network will be deployed in consecutive phases, allowing adaption and

development of the network to grow together. The phases cover independent

market sections but are interconnected in our network model and are all fueled

by the same token; the EFX token.

The rest of the Effect.AI whitepaper is structured as follows. The Effect

Network will be outlined in section 2. Hereafter, section 3, section 4, and

section 5 will detail the three different phases for the development of the Effect

Network , in chronological order. The whitepaper will be concluded in section 6.

2 The community driven Effect Network

The Effect Network can be deployed and used as a decentralized application

as-is. However, in order for the network to grow and be sustainable, we believe

there has to be a form of governance. Participants should have incentive to use

the EFX token for the purpose of AI tasks. Investors looking for quick monetary

gain should be discouraged and pump-and-dump schemes should be avoided in

order for the network to grow and slowly take market value from the existing

centralized services.

The Effect.AI Galaxy Pool (EGP) will be outlined in section 2.A. There-

after, section 2.B will explain the reputation mechanism in the network. The

Effect.AI Galaxy Allowance (EGA) will be outlined in section 2.C, section 2.D

details the governance system, section 2.E is dedicated to the improvement pro-

posal system, and section 2.F explains the council formation. This Section will

finish with blockchain implementation specifics on the NEO and GAS platform in

section 2.G.

2.A EFX tokens and the Effect Galaxy Pool

It is important to maintain liquidity in EFX tokens, especially during the early

days when there is no listing on exchanges. Ideally the following actions should

always be possible:

1. Workers are able to sell their EFX rewards for native tokens

2. Requesters and network users should be able to buy EFX

For a new token on the market this kind of liquidity can be hard to achieve

and can be hurt by speculative trading. The Effect.AI Network (Effect Network)

Page 8



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

will maintain a central pool of tokens to provide liquidity, encourage adoption

and stabilize network fees. This pool is called the Effect.AI Galaxy Pool (EGP)

and consists of a mix of EFX and native tokens. Several rules will drive the EGP

towards an equilibrium. These rules can later be refined by means of governance

as is discussed in section 2.D.

The EGP ensures stable exchange rates for users of the network at all times.

The pool is not suitable for day traders, as only Galaxy-EFX tokens (G-EFX)

can be bought. Any G-EFX bought from the EGP can not be sold back to the

EGP. A G-EFX is washed (converted to a regular EFX token) by spending it

through an Effect.AI Service Contract (ESC). These are the smart contracts

that processs the transactions of tasks and the service registry. This protects

the EGP from external manipulation and keeps exchange rates stable for all

To assure Requesters will not have an overflow G-EFX will gradually expire

Council, and α is the number of blocks that have to go past for the function to

, or short ∆, denotes the number of blocks since the

last time the G-EFX was decreased.

This ensures, for a Requesters, there is seamless payment for the ESC with

native tokens, such as NEO, GAS, and other NEP5 tokens.

Page 10



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

Other measures that will be undertaken in order to maintain a healthy liq-

uidity in the Effect Network to keep the EGP stable, especially in the first

phase of the development, are the implementation of beneficial exchange rates

between EFX tokens and the native tokens NEO, GAS, and NEP5 tokens. This

means that Requesters will have to pay less native tokens to use Effect Services,

and that Workers will recieve more native tokens in exchange for their received

EFX tokens.

In the future, when cross-chain trading techniques are more common in

blockchain, other tokens (e.g. BTC and ETH) can be added to the EGP.

2.B Effect Reputation Score

Users in the Effect Network are rewarded for the amount of effort and work

they do. This could allow malevolent users to gain wealth by submitting large

quantities of work with poor quality [5]. To avoid users submit work with bad

quality, the network will appraise users by their quality of work. Users that put

in good effort will get a higher Effect.AI Reputation Score (ERS), and users

that put in poor effort will get a lower ERS. This score will gradually expire

over time. Workers with a higher ERS will be able to apply for higher rewarding

tasks than workers with a lower score. Furthermore, workers with higher, rather

than lower, ERS will have to pay a lower fee over their recieved EFX tokens to

the EGP.

ERS is credited to users ad-hoc when they are rated for good work. There

are two ways this can happen:

1. The task owner can add Ground Truth / Known Answer ratings of exam-

ples. If a worker rates an example similar to the ground-truth provide by

the task owner, they are rewarded ERS, else they lose this score. Ground-

Truth examples are stored encrypted on the blockchain and the decryption

key is shared by the requester after the task has expired. Thus the rating

takes place after task expiration time.

2. Workers that deliver similar work and performance on the same Human

Page 11



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

Intelligence Tasks (HIT) (section 3) are credited with ERS. This is done

periodically and at random. Workers that consequently give deviant feed-

back are subtracted ERS.

The ERS function is represented in eq. (2). Let F (t) be the degradation

function of positive scores, and negative scores, over time. Let P be a set of

positive score-time entries p, and N be a set of negative score-time entries n.

ERS =
NP∑
i

[
pi,score × F (pi,time)

]
− ω

( NN∑
i

[
ni,score × F (ni,time)

])
(2)

Where NP is the total number of positive evaluations, and NN is the total

number of negative evaluations. ω is the weight factor for negative scores that is

governed (section 2.D) to maintain a healthy and effective workforce in Effect.AI.

As of now, we found a linear degradation in F (t), and a weight ω = 5 assures

best results in our simulations.

2.C Galaxy Allowance

An other use case of the Galaxy Pool is to provide liquidity on the supply side

of EFX. Earlier we saw how “consumers” of services can purchase G-EFX which

is only spendable to Effect Service Contracts. In a similar way “producers” of

services are able to sell EFX to the EGP at fixed rates. As the rates can be

profitable compared to market, this exchange must be restricted to contributers

of the network. To accomplish this we introduce Galaxy Allowance.

Any person or algorithm on the network that earns EFX tokens from an ESC,

gets an equal amount of Effect.AI Galaxy Allowance (EGA). EGA can be used

to sell an amount of EFX tokens to the EGP at a very profitable rate. This rate

is maintained by the Effect.AI Council (section 2.F) through voting. This way

Workers and algorithms are not dependent on market fluctuation of EFX tokens

as they can always sell their earning at stable rates. The general Effect.AI

exchange protocol is reflected in eq. (3), eq. (4), and eq. (5). The exchange

Page 12



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

rates cNEO, cGAS, and cNEP5 remain constant untill the Effect.AI Council changes

them.

NEO = cNEO × EFX (3)

GAS = cGAS × EFX (4)

NEP5 = cNEP5 × EFX (5)

2.D Governance

The blockchain is immutable by nature, yet the Effect Network has to be able

to continuously adapt to market and research developments. This means the

network needs a mechanism to apply changes to its components when necessary.

There are two types of changes that can be applied. Firstly, there are the

variables defined in Smart Contracts (SCs) that can change over time. Examples

of SCs’ variables that can change over time are the exchange rates in the EGP

and the fees over service transactions. Secondly, the smart contracts themselves

need to be changeable with sufficient agreement: introducing new SCs - like new

task types - and amending existing contracts will be necessary in the future.

As the Effect Network is decentralized there can not be a single person or

organization authoring these changes. To fix this, the network has a governance

system that allows prominent people in the community to propose and vote for

improvements as explained in section 2.E. Right to vote is at first acquired by

selected individuals as discussed in section 2.F.

2.E Improvement Proposals

Both smart contracts and service variable adjustments should be submitted to

an improvement proposal system. Each proposal contains logic for adjusting

parts of the ecosystem. A proposal is only executed if a majority of the council

members voted in favor of it within a time limit.

Page 13



Effect Network: Decentralized Network for Artificial Intelligence REV-1.0

2.F Effect Council

The Effect.AI Council (EC) is a group of individuals that are allowed to cast a

vote on improvement proposals. This council is dynamic in size; one can leave

the group at any time and new members can join if they are approved by the

majority. The council members are responsible to continuously apply changes

to the network so it can adapt to the dynamic market.

2.G Implementation

This Section contains examples of how the platform would function when built

on the NEO blockchain. NEO is a blockchain that uses Delegate Byzantine Fault

Tolerance (dBFT) consensus and features Turing-complete SCs. It also has

features for user identification and file storage that make it a very suitable host

for the Effect Network .

Galaxy Pool: NEO and GAS In NEO there are two native tokens: NEO and

GAS. The GAS is a utility token used for paying network fees. These are fees

associated with deploying and executing smart contracts. NEO acts as a share

in the platform; holding NEO gives a payout in GAS from network usage. In this

setup, the EGP should hold a combination of EFX, NEO and GAS to function

correctly. The NEO is used to payout workers at a stable exchange rate and

to increase the GAS stake by collecting dividend. As NEO is indivisible the rate

should be defined in EFXNEO . The GAS is used to pay any network fees to users of

the network, so workers will not have to go to an exchange to use the platform.

The GAS is also used to deploy new smart contracts and amend existing smart

contracts. This is crucial as the Effect Network will be developing all the time.

3 Phase 1: Effect.AI Mechanical Turk

The Effect.AI Mechanical Turk (EMT) platform is a decentralized, peer to

peer marketplace for tasks that require human intelligence. It provides sim-

ilar features as centralized services like Amazon Mechanical Turk6, Fiverr7,

Crowdsource8 and Guru.com9. It is a crowdsourcing technology that enables

Requesters (section 3.A) to submit tasks that can be completed by human agents

in exchange for compensation. Workers (section 3.B) can accept tasks from Re-

questers at any time, anywhere and from any device. The tasks are called Hu-

man Intelligence Tasks (HIT). The providers of the HITs are called Requesters.

When a Worker completes a HIT, they are paid with cryptographic EFX tokens.

3.A Requesters

Requesters can put tasks (see section 3.C) on the EMT platform to be completed

by workers. The requesters can decide how many EFX the workers will get for

each completed task. The requesters can retrieve the results from the EMT

platform and use these results to, for example: train their Artificial Intelligence

(AI) algorithm. EMT gives requesters access to an on-demand, scalable and

distributed workforce.

3.B Workers

Workers can complete the tasks from the requesters in exchange for the EFX

tokens tied to these HITs (see section 3.C).

3.C Tasks

A HIT task represent a piece of work that has been submitted by a Requester,

and can be accepted by Workers that match its requirements. Each task points

to a data set that can contain any amount of media assets. The contract ID

of the task will validate the format of the data. Extracting and presenting

examples from the data set is done by the user interface. A task has at least

the properties shown in table 1.

The structure and required feedback for a task is defined by the contract

ID and the blueprint. Each type op task requires a smart contract to handle

interaction. Effect.AI maintains a database of deployed smart contracts to make

it easy for requesters and workers to interact with the network. Adding smart

contracts to the network is handled through governance (section 2.D). Affiliate

programs will cover costs of deploying new contract types.

Table 1: Properties of a HIT

3.D Data sets

Data sets are often large and consist of various types of media. A blockchain is

not a suitable database for storing this kind of information. Other decentralized

storage options, like BitTorrent10 and IPFS11, are specialized in these types of

assets. For this reason, the network will use a similar hash-based distributed

file storage, where each media asset can be referred to by a single hash.

Note that the feedback on a task can also involve storing media assets, for

example in tasks like image segmentation. In this case the ratings asset will be

stored on the distributed storage, and a hash and checksum of the rating are

stored on the blockchain.

Requesters will also be able to supply data sets through traditional channels,

like Amazon S312, Google Cloud Storage13, or File Transfer Protocol (FTP)14.

3.E Privacy

The blockchain is decentralized and open by nature. These properties are not

always desirable, for example when privacy is concerned. There are several

measures that must be taken to make sure the Effect Network can be used for

sensitive information. The network can provide privacy for the following cases:

Data sets Requesters can provide their data set in encrypted form. Only se-

lected users will be able to decrypt or access the data. This is determined

by network smart contracts using Public Key Encryption, ensuring only

selected users can decrypt the data set credentials.

User ratings Ratings of tasks performed by workers are stored on the blockchain

using Public Key Encryption. The public key of the owner is used to sign

the ratings, so only the owner of the task can view the ratings.

Tasks that involve privacy features will be more computationally expensive,

thus will also have a higher network fee.

4 Phase 2: Effect.AI Smart Market

The Effect.AI Smart Market (ESM) is a decentralized marketplace where AI

algorithms can exchange their services. An application owner can register on

the exchange by specifying a public endpoint of his or her application, following

our data interchange format and specifying a usage fee for consumers. This

application can now be invoked through smart contracts on the blockchain.

The caller of the contract will have to transfer the required funds to the owner

of the contract to get an authorization token that allows him or her to interact

with the application.

The exchange protocol can be built directly onto the Effect.AI interface

setup proposed in section 2, where the agents receiving EFX tokens are the ones

supplying AI algorithms, and the agents providing EFX tokens for these services

are the Requesters. The Effect.AI Galaxy Pool (EGP) is merely used in the

background to assure liquidity. The EGP enables payments for these services

with native tokens, as well as EFX tokens. At this point Smart Contracts (SCs)

will ensure and improve availabilty of the services that are requested and/or

provided by agents in the network.

Two important pillars in the ESM are the application registry and the end-

points. The following subsections will describe the application registry (sec-

tion 4.A) and enpoints (section 4.B) in more detail.

4.A Application registry

The network will maintain a registry of available applications. This registry will

be enriched with a semantic ontology that describes the application, as well as

a technical schema of its inputs and outputs.

Thanks to the application registry, algorithms are able to explore possible

collaborations over the blockchain. It also encourages standardization of data

exchange formats, as interoperability with other applications means more inter-

actions, providing an obvious financial incentive.

4.B Endpoints

Application endpoints on the ESM communicate over the HTTP protocol. Data

is exchanged in JSON format and should strongly confirm the defined RDF

schema.

Requests signed with the private key of the buyer will be accepted by the

endpoint. Issuing authorization tokens and checking their validity can be done

by public APIs that hold a partial index of the blockchain. They could request

small fees for providing this service.

5 Phase 3: Effect.AI Power

Phase 1 and 2 of the Effect Network decentralized the data gathering and usage

of AI algorithms. Up to this point the algorithms themselves still run on cen-

tralized servers. In the final phase of the network the actual computation will

be distributed so that the algorithms run globally without a single point of fail-

ure. To achieve this we use the fact that most machine learning algorithms have

rigid structure and operate on sets of weights. These types of algorithms are

relatively easy to distribute. The Effect Network decentralized compute engine

is based on popular Deep Learning (DL) frameworks like Caffe15, MXNet16,

and TensorFlow17, where the network structure can be defined as a declarative

graph and weights are stored as matrices of real numbers. These matrices can

be distributed over a decentralized file system and be processed at different

compute nodes on the network.

6 Conclusion

Having an open, accessible and affordable platform for intelligent algorithms

to operate and develop will be a key component in the coming century. Ar-

tificial Intelligence (AI) and decentralization are a natural match and should

be enforced more in the future. The vision and development roadmap of the

Effect.AI Network (Effect Network) is to create an accessable and decentralized

AI market.

Community The Effect Network is fueled by EFX tokens that allow for fair,

decentralized and peer-to-peer exchange for everything related to AI. EFX tokens

are NEP5 conform and operate directly within the NEO smart economy blockchain.

Galaxy Pool One of the most unique facets of Effect.AI is the Effect.AI

Galaxy Pool (EGP). The EGP is a governed exchange system and pool. The

EGP is filled with both native NEO and GAS, as wel as, EFX and other NEP5 tokens.

This setup assures stable exchange rates. Furthermore, the EGP construction

will allow to increase liquidity by providing, for example, beneficial exchange in

the first phase of the network.

Prospects Besides a strong community driven platform and token exchange

Galaxy Pool, the Effect Network will develop three different AI service mar-

kets, in consequtive phases. The first phase is called Effect.AI Mechanical Turk

(EMT) and is similar to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk data labeling platform. Ef-

fect.AI will effectively push the mechanical turk service on the blockchain using

Effect.AI Service Contract (ESC), the smart contracts in the Effect Network .

The second phase, Effect.AI Smart Market (ESM), builds upon the first phases

by expanding the service market, not only for data, but with algorithms as well.

The ESM allows agents in the Effect Network to share, compare, and exchange

AI algorithms. The third, and last, phase is called Effect.AI Power (EP) and

allows for computation sharing completely in the Effect Network . EP completes

the Effect Network . The effect of this network will define the future relationship

between humans and AI.
