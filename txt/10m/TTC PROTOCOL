TTC Protocol:
A Decentralized and Incentivized
Social Networking protocol

v0.9



Abstract

The vast majority of current social networks operate on central-
ized architecture in which a service is provided to end users in 
exchange for viewing advertisements on the platform. This 
exchange forms the foundation of the attention economy.

The TTC Protocol is a decentralized and token-incentivized social 
networking protocol for the next generation of social platforms. 
The TTC Protocol provides a brand new social experience; the 
platform is completely decentralized. This gives participating 
individuals a highly rewarding and dynamic user experience.

With blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the TTC Protocol will also 
offer cryptocurrency incentives via a token also named TTC. 
Social network users are rewarded for generating, distributing, 
and interacting with other users and their content. The TTC Pro-
tocol returns the commercial value in the attention economy to 
those same users that cultivate the network.

By combining the TTC Protocol’s token based incentive mecha-
nism together with the distribution of user-generated, the  TTC 
Protocol itself is led by each end user. As the number of end 
users grows, the TTC Protocol becomes more valuable, and the 
commercial value of the TTC token increases.

The first decentralized application(DAPP) on the open platform 
TTC Protocol will be tataUFO, a social network service with more 
than 10 million total users. tataUFO is committed to breaking the 
conventional bottleneck of social networks, decentralizing con-
tent distribution, and returning value to individual users through 
a blockchain-driven tokenized incentive mechanism.

01Background

TTC
Protocol

Decentralized 
Social Networks

Individuals have adapted to the rapid development of mobile 

communication technology by finding new ways to share their 

lives, interact with one another, and form communities. Social 

networks are no longer simply technological phenomena. Major 

platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Weibo have fundamen-

tally changed the way users express identity, communicate ideas, 

and develop relationships.

As social network services grow increasingly sophisticated, users 

run up against limitations caused by their centralized architec-

tures. Currently, the platforms themselves determine how 

user-generated content is distributed. The resulting dynamic 

favors paid content, while authentic user-generated content is 

condemned to low engagement and low visibility. Additionally, 

advertising revenue generated by users’ likes, shares, and other 

forms of engagement flows to the platform provider rather than 

to its contributing users.

This dynamic has not gone unnoticed. Users’ patience is wearing 

thin, and users now expect a new generation of transparent, 

open-minded, decentralized social networks that incentivize 

participants rather than platforms. This is the next generation of 

social network.

It is clear that in a centralized system, the platform wields control

over content distribution. It is the platform that benefits from 

advertising. In a decentralized system, users decide which 
content is worth seeing, and the benefit goes directly to users.

03Background

TTC
Protocol

Practically, a blockchain is a digital ledger that is used to record 
transactions across multiple parties. It is decentralized, distrib-
uted, and public, and because the record cannot be altered 
retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent information 
in collusion with the entire network, blockchain technology is 
secure by design. This makes blockchains suitable for keeping 
track of events, medical information, financial transactions, and 
other types of record keeping.

Technically, a blockchain is a distributed computing system that 
has achieved “decentralized consensus.” This means that there 
is no central authority that determines how and what informa-
tion gets added to the ledger. The protocol around a blockchain 
is what allows participants on the network to reach a consensus 
about how to add new information, even when members cannot 
trust one another.

Recently, blockchain technology has led to rapid development of 
identity management, transaction processing, documenting 
provenance and supply chains. Blockchains are starting to 
infiltrate our everyday lives.

In 2017, there were more than 600 blockchain projects imple-
menting ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). In 2018, there were 200 
ICO projects in January alone. So far, there are more than 6,000 
cryptocurrency exchanges all over the world.

Blockchain
Technology



04Background

TTC
Protocol

There are several ways in which blockchain technology can be 
naturally applied to social networks. For a social network to 
develop, participating users must be able to interact easily. Each 
user on the platform functions as a node in the network. As the 
frequency and the probability at which users interact increase, 
the density of nodes increases. This is highly compatible with 
blockchains.

In recent years, blockchain-based content platforms have 
garnered public attention. One such platform is Steemit.com, a 
decentralized and token-incentivized platform that gives crypto-
currency rewards to users who produce and interact with high 
quality posts. However, on Steemit.com the barrier to entry is 
steep. It is still challenging for ordinary bloggers to share their 
interests, opinions, and knowledge because the platform 
mandates that only rigorous posts meeting a high standard of 
professionalism will be rewarded. As a result, the platform is 
highly concentrated with a select group of users that are able 
to take advantage of the Steemit reward system.

Other experiments with blockchain-based social networks focus 
on finding communication solutions, such as server-less 
messengers. Hardly anyone has attempted to create protocols 
specifically for the kind of content and user behaviors seen on 
social networks. Given its potential in the social space, platforms 
that combine blockchain and social networking are coming.

05Background

TTC
Protocol

Token-Incentivized 
Social Networks

Rewarding some users with cryptocurrency tokens creates eco-
nomic incentives. These incentives effectively facilitate the 
establishment and growth of social networks in a few ways.

Proactive users  Every user in the network is a stakehold-
er, which contributes to a shared belief that contributions 
matter. Users will participate proactively as their contribu-
tions are clearly and fairly recognized and rewarded.

Healthy atmosphere  Content aligned with the core values 
of the network gets highly rewarded. This creates a 
self-sustaining cycle where users are encouraged to create 
content that strengthens the network.

Exponential growth  As the network grows, it increases 
the value of the network, which in turn increases the value 
of the incentives. Not only does this make incentives more 
attractive to users, it also builds public awareness about 
the network.

06TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

The TTC token (TTC) is a universal token based on blockchain, 
issued as the operating medium for smart contracts. Compared 
to traditional mining mechanisms, the TTC token is issued to 
users depending on their contribution levels to the platform. This 
incentivizes users to be active in making contributions and main-
taining a positive and consistent personal image on the platform.

Advertisers can promote brands and products through the TTC 
Protocol’s advertising platform. Unlike traditional platforms 
that are centralized, the profits from advertising go directly to 
users. This fosters a win-win relationship for both advertisers 
and users.

Economic 
System

TTC tokens are distributed as rewards on a daily basis to 
users who contribute to the platform. Rewards are divided 
into three types.

Content reward   For users who create high quality con-
tent, and for users who interact with content by liking, 
commenting, sharing, or reporting

Reputation reward  For users who make contributions 
over the long term by showing loyalty to the platform, 
consistently creating high quality content, and gaining 
recognition from others

Advertising reward    For users who take part in promo-
tional activities such as watching advertisements, par-
ticipating in themed campaigns, or completing customer 
surveys

Both content and reputation rewards are issued from a fixed 
pool of TTC tokens programmed into the smart contract of the 
TTC Protocol. Advertisement rewards are generated by the 
TTC tokens introduced to the platform by advertisers.

Content 
reward

A piece of content's value in TTC tokens is determined by the rep-
utation of the users who interact with it. A user’s reputation 
affects the value of a piece of content whenever that user likes, 
comments, shares, or reports it. 

If a user with a high reputation interacts with a piece of content, 
that content is given higher value and higher exposure. Addition-
ally, content shared on other platforms is also given higher value 
because it’s exposure off the network increases the value of the 
network.

Content with a higher value will be given wider exposure, and 
also both the user who created that content and the users who 
interacted with it are given larger rewards of TTC tokens.

When a user interacts with a piece of content in multiple ways 
(e.g., liking and sharing a piece of content), only the form with 
the highest weight applies to calculate the content value. Each 
additional form of interaction adds 1 point to the value of the 

Content value  =  �like-weight * ∑ � (reputation of liker) + �com-
ment-weight * ∑ � (reputation of commenter) +  �share-weight * ∑ � 
(reputation of sharer) - ∑ � (reputation of reporter)

( at the beginning, �like-weight : �comment-weight : �share-weight = 
30% : 50% : 20% )



11TTC Token

Protocol

content. For example, if we have a user with the reputation score 
of 12, any piece of content that user likes, comments, and shares 
will be assigned 14 points.

Should content be reported, points equivalent to the reporter’s 
reputation points are deducted from the content’s value. 
Additionally anytime the creator of that reported content inter-
acts with other content, those interactions no longer add value. 
To adjudicate willful wrongdoing, mistakes, and unclear cases, 
reported content will be evaluated by an audit committee.



12TTC Token

TTC

Reputation 
reward

Reputation is a quantified value of the long-term contribu-
tions made by a user in terms of their loyalty, the quality of 
the content they create, their number of followers, as well as 
their participation in auditing reported content.

A user’s reputation value begins at 1 when he or she regis-
ters. The maximum reputation value is 100. The reputation 
value increases quickly as new users improve their reputa-
tion, but slows down gradually as users begin reaching the 
upper limit.

Retention value   Reflects the loyalty of a user toward the 
platform. As the user keeps coming back to the platform, 
the retention value grows at a much lower rate, with an 
upper limit of 20.

Vretention = log ( n, Nd )

Reputation  =  Retention Value  + Value of Content created 
+Follower Value + Auditing & Reporting Value

（At the beginning, Retention Value : Content Creating Value : 
Follower Value : Auditing Reporting Value = 20 : 30 : 30 : 20）



13TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

Value of content created    Value of Content Created Re-
flects the quality of content a user creates. As a user cre-
ates more content, the content created value grows at a 
much lower rate, with an upper limit of 30.

Follower value    Reflects a user’s popularity on the plat-
form. As a user gets more followers, the follower value 
grows at a much lower rate, with an upper limit of 30.

Auditing & reporting value   Reflects a user’s contribu-
tion to maintain the quality of the platform. Reported 
content is sent to an audit committee formed by selected 
users on the platform. The report succeeds when half of the 
audit committee members reach a verdict in favor of the 
reporter. The reporter then gets a reputation reward when 
the report succeeds, while he or she may suffer a repu-
tation loss when the report fails. The audit committee 
members who contribute to the final verdict also gain 
reputation bonuses. As a user part ic ipates in more

reward

An advertiser acquires a certain number of TTC tokens 
from the exchange and uses it to bid on advertising network of

distributed directly to the users that view and interact with the 
advertisements. The TTC Protocol itself takes a fractional trans-
action fee to cover the maintenance cost of implementing the 
advertising network.

Content reward
The content reward is distributed according to the calculat-
ed value of the relevant piece of content.

The value calculation cycle is 24 hours, which means that 
only the interaction that occurs in the first 24 hours after a 
piece of content is created affects that content's value. 
Interactions after the first 24 hours do not affect the content 
value. The content reward is distributed at 24:00 of the day 
that content’s 24 hour calculation cycle ends.

Content value is distributed between the creator of the con-
tent and users who interact with said content. The initial 
proportion falls into the golden ratio with the creator being 
awarded 61.8% while those who interact with the content 
being awarded 38.2%.

Users who interact with content are rewarded according to 
the Fibonacci sequence. For instance, the first 5 users that 
interact with the content would share the reward with the 
percentage of 8/19, 5/19, 3/19, 2/19 and 1/19 respectively.

Reputation reward     The reputation reward is distributed to 
each user in the platform according to their reputation value 
exactly one day prior to the payout day. 

Advertising reward   Additionally, users can earn extra TTC 
tokens by interacting with advertisements. These TTC tokens 
are introduced into the platform by advertisers.



19TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

There are several ways for content to reach users. Content 
deemed by the network to be valuable and content that is likely 
relevant to a user’s interests are given greater exposure. Users 
who discover content that resonates with others are given great-
er rewards as well, which encourages users to curate and pro-
vide exposure to high quality content. After a user interacts 
with a piece of content, it is also exposed to those who have 
chosen to follow that user.

Following   In this category, an active user sees content 
created by other users the active user has chosen to follow, as 
well as content those users liked or commented on. Con-
tent will be ranked according to the reputation of the users 
who created it, as well as those who interacted with it.

Trending   In this category, an active user sees content the 
entire community has deemed most valuable. The rankings of 
the most valuable content are calculated every minute. 

Discovery   In this category, an active user sees newly creat-
ed content and content that is tailored to the active user’s 
taste. Interest will be determined by tags and other metadata.

20TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

There exists a possibility that a user may try to acquire some 
unfair reward by abusing the reward policies. This would be 
potentially damaging to other users and to the reputation of the 
TTC Protocol. To minimize this risk, there are several mecha-
nisms the TTC Protocol will employ to detect abnormal behav-
iors.

System identification   The system will automatically 
identify and quarantine a set of predetermined abnormal 
behaviors, such as repeating meaningless comments in short 
time span. Users exhibiting these behaviors would be exempt 
from reward disbursement.

Reporting   When a particular piece of content is reported 
multiple times by several different users, the content’s deter-
mined value and chance of exposure drops dramatically. As a 
result, any content reward for the creator and those who 
interact with it would be minimized.

Auditing   Any content that has been reported by a certain 
number of users will be automatically sent to an audit 
committee comprising users with comparatively higher stand-
ing within the TTC Protocol. If more than half of the committee 
members reach an unfavorable verdict as to the appropriate-
ness of the content for the TTC Protocol, the content will be 
suspended from circulation while the content creator faces a 
decrease in reputation value. Conversely, the reporters and 

Governance



21TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

committee members who reached the verdict in favor of the 
reporter will receive an increase in reputation value. In the 
reverse verdict that rules for the content instead of against, 
the opposite will be true. Reporters and committee members 
will decrease in reputation value while the creator will increase 
in reputation value.



22TTC Token

TTC
Protocol

As the universal token for all DAPPs, the TTC token plays an 
important role in providing a better user experience. The TTC 
Protocol is open to developers, third party applications, and 
service providers. For example, in tataUFO, TTC tokens can be 
used in the following ways:

Users can purchase 
emoticons developed by 
third party contributors 
with TTC tokens.

Third party chat bots 
can offer various 
services such as

reports, up-to-date 
exchange rates, and 
other premium services.



23TTC Token

Private gifting   Once users follow one another, the chat 
feature is enabled. Users can send other users gifts of TTC 
tokens via private chat.

Discount coupons   Users can use TTC tokens to purchase 
discount coupons for online and offline stores.

Additional scenarios in other DAPPs might include bounty 
payments, interactive game earnings, special item purchases, 
and more. There are numerous possible ways to use TTC 
tokens to provide a richer user experience. 

Polls

Users can use TTC 
tokens to start a poll that 
gathers general opinion 
on a specific topic. Poll 
participants are 
rewarded with TTC 
tokens.

Developers of the open platform TTC Protocol also share the 
benefits of a decentralized and token-incentivized social net-
work. Any developer can create his or her own blockchain 
DAPP and promote it on the TTC Protocol. To foster a unified 
and solid ecosystem, all DAPPs will be accessible with a single 
user account and wallet.

In addition, the TTC Protocol will also support a unified ad-
vertising platform with TTC tokens as the universal currency. 
Advertisers can select multiple user groups from different 
DAPPs to increase the influence and value of those advertise-
ments.

Users may cross over from one DAPP to another to interact 
with communities across the entire TTC ecosystem. This 
brings robustness to the TTC Protocol with a Single Sign-On 
(SSO) function.

DAPPs increase the number of users and thus bring in more 
advertisers over time. This increases the commercial value 
of the TTC Protocol and raises the cost of advertising. In 
turn, users will have access to a smaller amount of TTC 
tokens everyday, but TTC tokens will have greater value.

tataUFO will be the first DAPP on the open platform TTC Pro-
tocol. We encourage other developers to follow tataUFO’s 
lead and to take advantage of the benefits that come from a 
decentralized, token-incentivized social network.

TTC
Protocol

The TTC Protocol is built on the public Ethereum network. As 
the most widely used blockchain network, Ethereum provides 
reliable and flexible services for DAPPs to operate. However, 
with the growing number of DAPPs and users, Ethereum is 
overburdened. The current daily number of transactions 
handled by Ethereum is over 100,000, resulting in the long 
wait times for transactions to be processed. Furthermore, 
Ethereum requires fees for every transaction on its block-
chain. It could be a considerable burden for users if the trans-
actions are not aggregated.

Given these barriers, the TTC Protocol will implement a bal-
anced on-chain and off-chain transaction service. The trans-
actions in the TTC Protocol will be settled on the Ethereum 
blockchain. Additionally, the TTC Foundation will implement 
an off-chain ledger to improve the efficiency of the system. 
Users’ actions will be initially recorded off-chain, then syn-
chronized on-chain upon computation. This hybrid solution 
creates a semi-centralized system in which all users on the 
TTC Protocol will have a relatively smooth and consistent 
experience.

TTC Foundation will continue to optimize the balanced 
on-chain and off-chain transaction service. Details of the 
off-chain mechanism will be kept transparent through various 
ways. In the long run, the TTC protocol ecosystem will evolve 
into a fully on-chain service, by working with other public

Figure 10.  TTC tokens issuance schedule

TTC tokens are issued according to a predetermined schedule. 
In the first year, half of the total TTC tokens pool shall be 
issued. In the coming years, the total TTC tokens issued each 
year will be equivalent to half of the total remaining TTC 
tokens to be issued. The TTC tokens issued each month shall 
be identical, the value of which halves every 12 months.

As shown in Figure 7, the TTC tokens each user can acquire 
each day drops quickly as the number of users increases.

TTC Each Month =    RewardPool

The value of TTC tokens depends on advertising costs, inde-
pendent of the influence of exchange. TTC tokens will expe-
rience fluctuations in value similar to what’ s seen on other 
advertising platforms, such as toutiao.com. A user could 
contribute $0.15 USD per month when the number of users 
is relatively small, but this figure could be around $1.5 USD 
when the number of users in the platform reaches a certain 
threshold. The ActiveRate begins at 100, dropping to around 
42% and going up to 50% as the number of users increase. 
This value is based on industry standards and the perfor-
mance of tataUFO.

dent of a country the laws of which prohibit or conflict with the Token Sale or 
your participation in the Token Sale (as referred hereto in the White Paper);

This White Paper in its current form is circulated by TTC Foundation for general 
information and to invite participant feedback only on the TTC protocol (the “TTC 
Protocol”) and the Tokens as presently conceived, and is subject to review and 
revision by the directors and/or advisors of TTC Foundation. Please do not repli-
cate or distribute any part of this White Paper without this section in accompani-
ment. The information set forth below may not be exhaustive and no part of this

White Paper or to be legally binding or enforceable by such recipient against TTC 
Foundation. An updated version of this White Paper may be published at a later 
date and to be announced by TTC Foundation in due course. 

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION AND THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS ENTITLED “DIS-
CLAIMER OF LIABILITY”, “NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES”, “REPRE-
SENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY YOU”, “CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FOR-
WARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS”, “THIRD PARTY INFORMATION AND NO CON-

IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ACTION YOU SHOULD TAKE, YOU SHOULD 
CONSULT YOUR LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVI-
SOR(S).

While we make every effort to ensure that any material in this White Paper is 
accurate and up to date, such material in no way constitutes the provision of 
professional advice. TTC Foundation does not guarantee, and accepts no legal 
liability whatsoever arising from or connected to, the accuracy, reliability, cur-
rency, or completeness of any material contained in this White Paper. Partici-
pants and potential Token holders should seek appropriate independent profes-
sional advice prior to relying on, or entering into any commitment or transaction 
based on, material published in this White Paper, which material is purely pub-
lished for reference purposes alone. 

The Tokens subject of the Pre-Initial Token Sale and Initial Token Sale are pro-
prietary cryptographic tokens issued and sold by an affiliate (“Issuer”) TTC 



Foundation. The Token will function as the native universal utility token used in 
the TTC Protocol as the means of value exchange and to power the TTC Protocol.

The Tokens are not be intended to constitute securities of any form, units in a 
business trust, units in a collective investment scheme or any other form of reg-
ulated investment or investment product in any jurisdiction. This White Paper 
does not constitute a prospectus or offer document of any sort and is not intend-
ed to constitute an offer of securities of any form, units in a business trust, units 
in a collective investment scheme or any other form of regulated investment or 
investment product, or a solicitation for any form of regulated investment or 
investment product in any jurisdiction. 

No regulatory authority has examined or approved of any of the information set 
out in this White Paper. No such action has been or will be taken by TTC Founda-
tion and/or Issuer to obtain such approval under the laws, regulatory require-
ments or rules of any jurisdiction. The provision of this White Paper to you does 
not imply that the applicable laws, regulatory requirements or rules have been 
complied with.

This White Paper does not constitute or form part of any opinion on any advice 
to purchase, sell or otherwise transact with Tokens and the fact of presentation 
of this White Paper shall not form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection 
with, any contract of investment decision.

THE TOKEN SALE (AS REFERRED TO HEREIN) IS INTENDED FOR, MADE TO OR 
DIRECTED AT ONLY PERSONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR 
THE PRC AND MAY BE ACTED UPON ONLY BY PERSONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA OR THE PRC. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE AND 
YOU ARE NOT TO PURCHASE ANY TOKENS  IN THE TOKEN SALE IF YOU ARE:

(A)  A CITIZEN, DOMICILED IN, OR RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA OR THE PRC;

(B)  LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE PRC AT THE TIME 
OF YOUR WHITELISTING FOR AND INTENDED PURCHASE OR PURCHASE OF 
TOKENS IN THE TOKEN SALE;

(C)  LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION WHERE THE TOKEN SALE IS PROHIBITED, 
RESTRICTED OR UNAUTHORISED IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHETHER IN 
FULL OR IN PART UNDER THE LAWS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR 
RULES IN SUCH JURISDICTION; OR



(D)  A PERSON WHO IS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED OR INELIGIBLE IN ANY 
WAY, WHETHER IN FULL OR IN PART, FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY PART OF 
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THE TOKEN SALE TERMS (AS 
DEFINED BELOW),

(COLLECTIVELY, “EXCLUDED PERSONS”).

For the purpose of this White Paper, to be “Whitelisted” means to be identified 
to be eligible to participate in the Token Sale by the Issuer subject to satisfacto-
ry know your client and anti-money laundering and counter financing of terror-
ism checks conducted in connection therewith, or such other criteria as may be 
imposed by the Issuer in connection therewith at its sole and absolute discre-
tion.

No Token should be construed, interpreted, classified or treated as enabling, or 
according any opportunity to, purchasers to participate in or receive profits, 
income, or other payments or returns arising from or in connection with the TTC 
Protocol or the Tokens or the proceeds of the Token Sale, or to receive sums paid 
out of such profits, income, or other payments or returns. 

No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in 
relation to the sale and purchase of the Tokens, and no cryptocurrency or other 
form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of this White Paper.

Any agreement as between Issuer and you as a purchaser, and in relation to any 
sale and purchase, of Tokens is to be governed by only a separate document 
setting out the terms and conditions (the “Token Sale Terms”) of such agree-
ment. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Token Sale Terms and this 
White Paper, the former shall prevail.

There are risks and uncertainties associated with TTC Foundation, the Issuer 
and their business and operations, the Tokens, the TTC Protocol, and the Token 
Sale. Please refer to the section entitled “Risks and Disclosures” set out at the 
end of this White Paper.

transmitted to any country where distribution or dissemination of this White 
Paper is prohibited or restricted.

ties By You”, “Cautionary Note On Forward-Looking Statements”, “Third Party

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Prospective purchasers of Tokens should carefully consider and evaluate all risks 
and uncertainties associated with the Issuer and TTC Foundation, and their busi-
ness and operations, the Tokens, the TTC Protocol, and the Token Sale, and all 
information set out in this White Paper and the Token Sale Terms prior to any 
purchase of the Tokens. If any of such risks and uncertainties develops into 
actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and pros-
pects of the Issuer could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, 
you may lose all or part of the value of the Tokens.

Please read the following risks and warnings before deciding to purchase 
Tokens. It should be noted the following list of risks and warnings is not exhaus-
tive. Accordingly, prospective purchasers should not place undue reliance on 
these statements.

1.      RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE

The Issuer may be forced to cease operations

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited 
to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat curren-
cies, the inability of the Issuer to establish the Project or the Token’s utility, 
the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership 
challenges, the Issuer may no longer be viable to operate and the Issuer may 
dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution of the Issuer.

There is no prior market for the Tokens and the Token Sale may not result in 
an active or liquid market for the Tokens 

Prior to the Token Sale, there has been no public market for the Tokens. In 
the event that the Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is 



no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Tokens will devel-
op or if developed, be sustained after the Tokens have been made available 
for trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that 
the market price of the Tokens will not decline below the purchase price of 
the Tokens (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative 
of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made available for 
trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-na-
tional or quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or 
other credit. The Issuer is not responsible for nor does it pursue the circula-
tion and trading of Tokens on the market. Trading of Tokens merely depends 
on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants, and 
no one is obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of the Token, includ-
ing the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price 
of Tokens to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot ensure 
that there will be any demand or market for Tokens, or that the Purchase 
Price is indicative of the market price of Tokens after they have been made 
available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

Future sales of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market 
price of Tokens

Any future sale of the Tokens (which were not available for sale in the Token 
Sale) would increase the supply of Tokens in the market and this may result 
in a downward price pressure on the Token. The sale or distribution of a 
significant number of Tokens outside of the Token Sale, or the percep
tion that such further sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the 
trading price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the 
Tokens

Negative publicity involving the Issuer, the TTC Protocol, the Tokens or any of 
the key personnel of the Issuer may materially and adversely affect the 
market perception or market price of the Tokens, whether or not such nega-
tive publicity is justified. 

There is no assurance of any success of the TTC Protocol

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance 
of the TTC Protocol. There is no assurance that the TTC Protocol will gain 



traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. 

The TTC Protocol has not been fully developed, finalised and integrated and 
is subject to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. 
Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its pro-
jected appeal to users, and hence impact its success. 

While the Issuer has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there 
is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be 
sufficient for the development and integration of the TTC Protocol. For the 
foregoing or any other reason, the development and integration of the TTC 
Protocol may not be completed and there is no assurance that it will be 
launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value, 
and this would impact its trading price.

If and when the TTC Protocol is fully developed, there is no assurance it will 
be widely adopted or utilised by its target users. 

The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale

The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, 
and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, 
and correspondingly the market price of, the Tokens may fluctuate signifi-
cantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some 
of which are beyond the control of the Issuer:

(a)  new technical innovations;

(b)  analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of 
the Token’s market price or the Issuer’s financial and business perfor-
mance;

(c)  changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with opera-
tions similar to that of the Issuer that may be made available for sale and 
purchase on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the Tokens;

(d)  announcements by the Issuer of significant events, for example part-
nerships, sponsorships, new product developments;

(e)  fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on 
cryptocurrency exchanges;



(f)  additions or departures of key personnel of the Issuer;

(g)  success or failure of the Issuer’s management in implementing busi-
ness and growth strategies; and

(h)  changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology 
industry, the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other 
events or factors.

The funds raised in the Token Sale are exposed to risks of theft

The Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the 
Token Sale will be securely held at such address as directed by the Issuer 
(“Receiving Address”). Further, upon receipt of the funds, the Issuer will 
make every effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely held 
through the implementation of security measures. Notwithstanding such 
security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the 
cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks (including but not limit-
ed to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-min-
ing” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or 
errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Receiving Address, the TTC block-
chain, or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for 
example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or 
abuse thereof. In such event, even if the Token Sale is completed, the Issuer 
may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the Issuer may 
not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the TTC Protocol, and 
the launch of the TTC Protocol might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. 
As such, the issued Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would 
impact its trading price. The Tokens are uninsured, unless you specifically 
obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of any loss or loss of 
value, you may have no recourse.

2.  RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESS AND WALLETS

The Receiving Address may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may 
not be able to be disbursed

The Receiving Address is designed to be secure. However, in the event that 
the Receiving Address is, for any reason compromised (including but not 
limited to scenarios of the loss of keys to such Receiving Address), the funds 
held by the Receiving Address may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, 
and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the Token 



Sale is successful, the Issuer will not be able to receive the funds raised and 
the Issuer will not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the 
TTC Protocol, and the implementation of the TTC Protocol might be temporar-
ily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth 
or value, and this would impact its trading price.

The loss or compromise of information relating to your wallet may affect your 
access and possession of the Tokens

Your access to the Tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”) depends on, 
among other things, the safeguards to the information to such Wallet, includ-
ing but not limited to the user account information, address, private key, and 
password. In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your 
access to the Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affecting your 
access and possession to the Tokens, including such Tokens being unrecover-
able and permanently lost.

The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with 
the Tokens

The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with 
the Tokens which may result in the delivery of Tokens being unsuccessful or 
affect your access to such Tokens.

3.  RISKS RELATING TO TTC FOUNDATION

The TTC Protocol is intended to be operated and maintained by TTC Founda-
tion. Any events or circumstances which adversely affect TTC Foundation 
may have a corresponding adverse effect on the TTC Protocol if such events 
or circumstances affect TTC Foundation’s ability to maintain the TTC Protocol. 
This would correspondingly have an impact on the trading price of the 
Tokens.

TTC Foundation may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effec-
tively manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which 
would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the TTC Protocol and 
consequently the trading price of the Tokens.

The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in 
which TTC Foundation competes have grown rapidly and continue to grow 
rapidly and evolve in response to new technological advances, changing busi-
ness models and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing envi-



ronment, TTC Foundation may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the 
changes, and the sustainability of TTC Foundation will depend on its ability to 
manage its operations, adapt to technological advances and market trends 
and ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees, and provide 
proper training for its personnel. 

As its business evolves, TTC Foundation must also expand and adapt its oper-
ational infrastructure. TTC Foundation’s business relies on its block-
chain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token 
storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology, 
and to manage technical support infrastructure for the TTC Protocol effective-
ly, TTC Foundation will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data sys-
tems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. These 
upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources, are likely 
to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third 
parties that TTC Foundation does not control. If TTC Foundation is unable to 
adapt its systems and organisation in a timely, efficient and cost-effective 
manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial con-
dition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If the third parties 
whom TTC Foundation relies on are subject to a security breach or otherwise 
suffer disruptions that impact the services TTC Foundation utilises, the integ-
rity and availability of its internal information could be compromised, which 
may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information, 
and economic loss. 

The loss of financial, labour or other resources, and any other adverse 
effect on TTC Foundation’s business, financial condition and operations, 
would have a direct adverse effect on TTC Foundation’s ability to maintain the 
TTC Protocol. As the TTC Protocol is the main product to which the Tokens 
relate, this may adversely impact the trading price of the Tokens.

There may be weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs in the TTC smart contract 

TTC Foundation will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the smart con-
tracts underlying the Tokens are audited, tested and approved by technical 
experts. However, as smart contract technology is still in its early stage of 
development and its application of experimental nature carries significant 
operation, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks, there 
are inherent risks that such smart contracts could contain weaknesses, 
vulnerabilities or bugs. 

Purchasers of Tokens should understand and accept that there are no warran-



ties that Tokens are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weak-
nesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which would cause loss in their worth or value. 
In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materialises, TTC Founda-
tion’s business strategies, results of operations and prospects may also be 
adversely affected.

TTC Foundation may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in 
its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or 
other causes that could adversely affect TTC Foundation’s infrastructure net-
work, and/or the TTC Protocol

TTC Foundation is unable to anticipate when there would be occurrences of 
hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to dou-
ble-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” 
attacks), distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in 
the TTC Protocol, the Tokens, the Receiving Address, the Wallet or any tech-
nology (including but not limited to smart contract technology) on which TTC 
Foundation, the TTC Protocol, the Tokens, the Receiving Address, and the 
Wallet relies or on the TTC blockchain or any other blockchain. Such events 
may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to 
exploitation or abuse thereof. TTC Foundation may not be able to detect such 
hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, 
majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attacks, 
distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely 
manner, and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multi-
ple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession. 

TTC Foundation’s network or services, which would include the TTC Protocol, 
could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equip-
ment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or even 
intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software 
viruses or attacks by unauthorised users, some of which are beyond TTC 
Foundation’s control. Although TTC Foundation has taken steps against mali-
cious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the 
maintenance of the TTC Protocol and its other services, there can be no 
assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not 
be attempted in the future, and that any of TTC Foundation’s enhanced secu-
rity measures will be effective. TTC Foundation may be prone to attacks on 
its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology, financial 
data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to TTC 
Foundation and users of the TTC Protocol. Any significant breach of TTC Foun-
dation’s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of 



the usability, stability and security of TTC Foundation’s network or services 
(including the TTC Protocol) may adversely affect the trading price of the 
Tokens.

We are dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third 
parties

TTC Foundation’s infrastructure network is in part established through serv-
ers that which it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties, 
and servers that it rents at data centre facilities of third parties. If TTC Foun-
dation is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable 
terms or at all, TTC Foundation may be required to transfer its servers to a 
new data centre facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service 
interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also vulner-
able to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, 
terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, 
the third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as 
a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and 
a third party may obtain unauthorised access to the data in such servers. As 
techniques used to obtain unauthorised access to, or to sabotage systems 
change frequently and generally are not recognised until launched against a 
target, TTC Foundation and the providers of such facilities may be unable to 
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. 
Any such security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon TTC 
Foundation’s infrastructure network and/or the TTC Protocol may adversely 
impact the price of the Tokens.

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact 
on TTC Foundation’s operating performance, results of operations and cash 
flows

TTC Foundation has been and could continue to be affected by general global 
economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide 
have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slow-
downs in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the econ-
omy could have a negative effect on TTC Foundation’s business, operations 
and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash 
flows. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, TTC Foundation 
may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pres-
sure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the TTC Protocol. Suppliers 
on which TTC Foundation relies for servers, bandwidth, location and other 
services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in 



turn, could have a negative impact on TTC Foundation’s operations or 
expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic con-
ditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring reces-
sion will not have a significant adverse impact on TTC Foundation’s business, 
financial condition and results of operations and hence the TTC Protocol, 
which would correspondingly impact the trading price of the Tokens.

TTC Foundation or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regula-
tions

Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous 
regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about con-
sidering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocur-
rency or cryptocurrency markets. TTC Foundation or the Tokens may be 
affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or 
cryptocurrency markets, including having to take measures to comply with 
such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, requests or enforce-
ment actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost 
and may also require substantial modifications to the TTC Protocol. This may 
impact the appeal of the TTC Protocol for users and result in decreased usage 
of the TTC Protocol. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of com-
plying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, 
maintaining the TTC Protocol may no longer be commercially viable and TTC 
Foundation may opt to discontinue the TTC Protocol and/or the Tokens. Fur-
ther, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory 
authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting 
distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the TTC Protocol 
and the Tokens. TTC Foundation may also have to cease operations in a juris-
diction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it com-
mercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approv-
al(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the 
trading price of Tokens will be adversely affected or Tokens may cease to be 
traded.

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, 
tokens, and token offerings such as the Token Sale, the TTC Protocol, and the 
Tokens is uncertain, and regulations or policies may materially adversely 
affect the development of the TTC Protocol and the utility of the Tokens

Regulation of tokens (including the Tokens) and token offerings such as the 
Token Sale, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency 
exchanges currently is undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, vary signifi-



cantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, and is sub-
ject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in Sin-
gapore and other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guid-
ance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and 
growth of the TTC Protocol and the adoption and utility of the Tokens. Failure 
by TTC Foundation or users of the TTC Protocol to comply with any laws, rules 
and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpreta-
tion and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse conse-
quences, including civil penalties and fines.

Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many 
foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the PRC, South Korea, and 
Russia. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, reg-
ulations or directives that affect the TTC Protocol. Such laws, regulations or 
directives may directly and negatively impact TTC Foundation’s business. The 
effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such 
change could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and 
growth of the TTC Protocol and the adoption and utility of the Tokens.

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and 
regulations may materially and adversely impact the value of the currency in 
which the Tokens may be sold, the value of the distributions that may be 
made by TTC Foundation, the liquidity of the Tokens, the ability to access 
marketplaces or exchanges on which to trade the Tokens, and the structure, 
rights and transferability of Tokens. 

Tokens holders will have no control on TTC Foundation

The holders of Tokens are not and will not be entitled, to vote or receive divi-
dends or be deemed the holder of capital stock of the issuer for any purpose, 
nor will anything be construed to confer on the purchaser any of the rights of 
a stockholder of TTC Foundation or any right to vote for the election of direc-
tors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or 
to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of 
meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise.

The purchaser may lack information for monitoring their investment

The purchaser may not be able to obtain all information it would want regard-
ing TTC Foundation, the Tokens, or the TTC Protocol, on a timely basis or at 
all. It is possible that the purchaser may not be aware on a timely basis of 
material adverse changes that have occurred. Information in relation to the 



development of Tokens may also be highly technical by nature. As a result of 
these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, the purchaser may not have 
accurate or accessible information about the TTC Protocol.

There may be risks relating to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist 
attacks, riots, civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and 
other force majeure events beyond the control of TTC Foundation

The Token Sale and the performance of TTC Foundation’s activities may be 
interrupted, suspended or delayed due to acts of God, natural disasters, 
wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions, widespread communicable 
diseases and other force majeure events beyond the control of TTC Founda-
tion. Such events could also lead to uncertainty in the economic outlook of 
global markets and there is no assurance that such markets will not be 
affected, or that recovery from the global financial crisis would continue. In 
such events, TTC Foundation’s business strategies, results of operations and 
prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Further, if an outbreak 
of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the countries 
in which TTC Foundation, the developers, data providers or data consumers 
have operations in the future, market sentiment could be adversely affected 
and this may have a negative impact on the TTC Protocol and community. 

There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic 
technology. In addition to the risks included in this Annex, there are other 
risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of the Tokens, including 
those that TTC Foundation cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materi-
alise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed 
hereto.
