Abstract 
 

Mobius is building innovative and simple cross-blockchain protocols to connect          
billions of people and devices to the blockchain ecosystem. The blockchain           
ecosystem has soared to a ​market capitalization greater than $100 billion at a             
growth rate rivaling Facebook​, yet the ​number of blockchain users rounds down            
to zero when compared to the number of internet users and devices that exist              
today. This gap between the internet world and blockchain world represents a            
multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Mobius is closing this gap through a two-sided           
solution creating both developer tools and a consumer DApp Store. On the            
developer side Mobius is creating standardized and simple universal         
cross-blockchain protocols APIs that will allow any developer to easily connect           
to the blockchain ecosystem. On the consumer sider, Mobius is creating an easy             
to use DApp Store that will disintermediate and decentralize the ​$6.3 trillion            
2021 App Economy​. 
 
The blockchain is the new decentralized internet; Mobius makes it production           
ready for mass adoption. Strong developer communities in conjunction with open           
APIs have been ​key to the success of the internet and its ecosystem of enterprises               
like Facebook, Salesforce, Amazon, and Alibaba to name a few. Similarly, the            
success of the expanding the blockchain ecosystem requires both developers and           
robust API protocols. Currently, blockchain developer tools and protocols are in           
their infancy and analogous to primitive web development tools in the early            
1990’s. The open bidirectional Mobius protocol APIs turn the ​18.2 million           
software developers in the world into blockchain developers through simple,          
standardized protocol APIs that make it easy to connect any application, device,            
or mission critical data stream to the blockchain ecosystem. The Mobius           
protocols define universal cross-blockchain standards for payments, login, and         
oracles through simple APIs, developer frameworks, and webhook callbacks. In          
the payment space, Mobius is analogous to Stripe, which made it easy for             
developers to accept any credit card. Mobius similarly makes it easy for            
developers to transact with any blockchain token and benefit from significantly           
lower transaction fees by disintermediating legacy centralized institutions. The         
Mobius DApp Store works in conjunction with the Mobius API to solve the             
consumer discovery problem and features fees that are greater than 70% lower            
than the centralized Apple and Google analogs.

1. Introduction 
The blockchain ecosystem is booming with cryptocurrency ​market capitalization soaring past           
$100 billion at a ​growth rate rivaling Facebook​. However, the ​number of blockchain users pales               
in comparison when compared to the ​4 billion internet users and ​8 billion Internet of Things (IoT)                 
devices that exist today. This gap between the internet world and blockchain world represents a               
multi-trillion dollar opportunity — the internet App Economy alone, which is a tiny sliver of the              
global internet economy, is predicted to be ​$6.3 trillion in 2021​. 
 
Mobius (MOBI) closes the gap between the internet world and blockchain world through             
innovative and simple protocols that introduce new standards for cross-blockchain login,           
payment, governance, and oracles. A strong developer community and open APIs have been ​key              
to the success of Facebook, Salesforce, and eBay and will similarly be key to the success of                 
blockchain and expanding it to the masses. Today there are ​18.2 million software developers in               
the world but there is an ​extreme shortage of blockchain developers​. Mobius will make every               
developer a blockchain developer through standardized simple cross-blockchain and internet          
bridging protocols. 
 
When developers are able to easily integrate blockchain technology into their applications and             
devices blockchain technology will ​experience exponential growth similar to the telephone           
system because of positive network effects and feedback loops that will develop and become              
stronger with each blockchain integration. At a macro level, blockchain will become the fastest              
growing technology of all time because it is a network system that rides on top of, and leverages,                  
the most powerful network of all time — the internet. 
 
Blockchain today is comparable to the internet in the early 1990s. In the ​early 1990s 9,600 bits                 
per second modems were just entering the market​. Today ​Ethereum runs at a mere ~13               
transactions per second​. Blockchain developer tools and protocols today are similarly comparable            
to web developer tools in the early 1990s before Stripe created a standardized simple protocol to                
accept credit card payments and ​Amazon AWS introduced simple cloud computing that made it              
easy for anyone to deploy a web application. Mobius similarly streamlines blockchain integration             
through a standardized set of protocol APIs that bridge the gap between blockchains and              
internet-connected applications. 

2. The Token Economy 
Today there are over ​800 tokens with many created this year by organizations that have sold them                 
to collectively raise ​almost $1.3 billion in the first half of 2017​. Some have questioned why a                 
company needs its token when it can accept Bitcoin. The answer is community and governance.               
A company can accept Bitcoin for payment but Bitcoin does not allow an organization to be run                 
by a decentralized community with a vested interest in its success.

When a company creates its own token it creates a cryptographically secure decentralized             
organizing utility upon which it can self-govern and moderate its platform through an open              
community of members. For example, an organization with its own token can hold secure              
community votes in which each token represents one vote. If the organization relied on Bitcoin it                
would open its proposal voting to all Bitcoin holders, the vast majority of which would have no                 
vested stake or interest in the organization and its platform. When an organization creates its own                
token, the holders of the token have a specific vested interest in the organization and platform and                 
therefore a token acts as a form of proof of membership to ensure that only people that are a part                    
of the community can vote. 
 
The concept of token based voting can be broadened and used for additional vested proof of stake                 
required micro-actions throughout a platform. For example, Wikipedia could require that editors            
have some tokens at stake before editing an article. Such a proof of stake requirement can help                 
reduce spam and other unwanted behavior. This concept could additionally be broaded to reward              
community members who contribute positively to the community and additionally penalize           
members that harm the community by taking away some of their at-stake tokens. This type of                
decentralized self-governance and moderation is revolutionary and will result in significant value            
creation and disintermediation.

3. Universal Blockchain Payment Protocol 
Today’s legacy global payment infrastructure is centralized, convoluted, and expensive.          
Accepting credit and debit cards involves a three step authorization, clearing, and settlement             
process that depends on payment gateways, terminals, merchant banks, credit card associations,            
cardholder banks, and other stakeholders resulting in high fees and slow payment finalization.             
Legacy payments are also expensive ​often costing approximately $0.30 + 2.9% per transaction​.

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize and simplify global payments by            
disintermediating large financial institutions and thus significantly reducing transaction costs.          
However, current blockchain developer APIs and frameworks are in their infancy and are very

hard to use. Blockchain developer technology today is similar to payment developer frameworks             
before Stripe. For example, below is an example of the ​Authorize.Net Merchant Web Services              
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) CreateCustomerProfile request data structure​:

The Authorize.net API is verbose, cumbersome, and hard to use. Below are the equivalent Stripe               
REST API calls: 
 
$ curl ​ ​https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens ​   \ ​. 
    -u ​sk_test_BQokikJ0vBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2 ​: \ ​..

    -d ​card ​[exp_year] ​= ​2018 ​ ​\ ​................ 
    -d ​card ​[cvc] ​= ​123 ​                    ​  ..

$ curl ​ ​https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens ​   \ ​. 
    -u ​sk_test_BQokikJ0vBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2 ​: \ ​..

The Stripe API is simple, elegant, and easy to use. Stripe leveraged complicated payment              
developer infrastructure to turn its developer-first, easy to use API into a company that has raised                
more than $440 million and is valued at over $9 billion. Mobius is solving the exact same                 
problem except for the emerging Blockchain Economy. 
 
The Mobius API provides a universal interface to accepting any blockchain token analogous to              
how Stripe provides a universal interface to accepting different credit cards such as Visa,              
Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. Currently it is very complicated to accept, manage,             
and secure tokens. For example, if a video game developer creates an Ethereum ERC20 token that                
acts as their in-game credits, it is complicated to move tokens between the Ethereum network and                
their backend accounting system. 
 

Current Token Developer Process: 
1. Run a full Ethereum node 
2. Create a unique Ethereum address for each user 
3. Monitor every user Ethereum address for incoming token transactions 
4. Secure the private keys 
5. Manage credit accounting in their backend 

 
The Mobius API simplifies all this by providing a modern easy to use REST API that returns                 
JSON and uses secure webhooks to alert developers of incoming token transfers.

The Mobius API currently works with any ERC20 token such as Golem, Augur, Iconomi,              
Bancor, Storj, Status, Credo, etc. There are plans to expand the API to support other blockchains                
and tokens besides Ethereum and ERC20. 

 

4. Universal Token Login Protocol 
Tokens can be used to represent membership to a service and can be used as a login mechanism.                  
Any service that uses tokens as a login mechanism will have similar technical infrastructure needs               
analogous to token payment infrastructure. Mobius will provide a simple REST API that abstracts              
low-level blockchain development required to verify token ownership at time of login and             
facilitate verified login. 
 
Using a token to represent a subscription provides several benefits including increased            
anonymity, lower transaction fees, and the potential for an independent secondary market to             
develop providing greater value for subscribers and incentive to purchase a subscription or             
membership early. The secondary market will allow people to anonymously buy and sell their              
membership without ever transacting over centralized financial institutions such as credit cards,            
debit cards, or bank accounts allowing for completely anonymity assuming an anonymous            
protocol such as PIVX is used. 
 
Multiple tiers of membership can also be represented through tokens by requiring a different              
number of tokens to access different levels. For example, a basic membership might only require               
one token to login while the plus membership might require five tokens to login. 

5. Universal Governance Protocol 
Many organizations that create a token and plan to use it for platform governance will have                
similar use cases. For example, if Wikipedia and Reddit each create a token they are likely to                 
have similar governance and proof of stake platform integration needs. On the governance side,              
both organizations may allow token holders to vote on proposals that dictate how the              

8 



 

communities develop. On the platform integration side, both may require advanced users such as              
editors or moderators to have some vested tokens at stake in order to reduce spam and harmful                 
community behavior. Both organizations may also want to reward community members that            
improve the community and add value. These similar use cases can be abstracted much as web                
frameworks and databases, the building blocks of web applications, have been abstracted. The             
vast majority of developers do not create their own web framework such as Ruby on Rails or their                  
own database server such as PostgreSQL. Instead they use one of the existing web frameworks or                
database servers to save time. Blockchain based governance will follow the same model and be               
offered to developers by Mobius via standard protocols and APIs that they can use to facilitate                
token based voting and vested at-stake micro-actions that result in token rewards or penalties              
based on community feedback. 

6. Decentralized App Economy 
One of the biggest problems hindering mass adoption of DApps and cryptocurrencies as fiat              
replacement is consumer discovery and adoption. Currently there is no widely used DApp Store.              
Mobius is creating a universal DApp Store that will be similar to the Apple App Store and Google                  
Play Store. Any app that accepts the Mobius Token will be listed in the DApp Store. The DApp                  
Store will also integrate the Mobius Token for a universal decentralized credit system that has               
significantly lower fees than the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The DApp Store fee will                 
only be 10%. The 10% fee is only charged if tokens are used through the DApp Store credit                  
system - if the developer uses the API to receive tokens there is only a 1% fee. 
 
The App Economy is predicted to ​grow to $6.3 trillion by 2021​. Apple and Google App Store                 
fees and credit card fees will take a meaningful percent of this revenue creating significant               
deadweight loss. Mobius will make it easy for developers to transition to the decentralized lower               
cost blockchain economy. Mobius fees are up to ~70% cheaper than existing centralized payment              
solutions. 
 
DApps will be incentivized to accept the Mobius Token in the DApp Store because of the                
network effects of the DApp Store. The Mobius Token will experience similar network effects to               
the Internet in which the token becomes more valuable as more people use it. This is in parallel to                   
a developer having its own token primarily for governance reasons. A developer that has its own                
token will still want to accept the easiest to use and cheapest form of payment from transient                 
users so they are not turned away. Simultaneously, a developer with its own token will want to                 
limit governance and at-stake based micro-actions to users with a vested stake in their community               
and platform. The DApp Store and Mobius Network provide a platform to easily support both use                
cases.

If the DApp Store only captures a mere 1.0% of the 2021 global App Economy projection, then it                  
would put approximately $63 billion worth of value in MOBI - more than Bitcoin’s market               
capitalization today.

7. Mobius Governance 
Mobius aims to democratize its platform by giving community members the power to vote on               
important proposals for the network’s developmental roadmap. Legacy commerce and social           
network ecosystems disenfranchise their existing user base, both developers and end users.            
Instead, these centralized networks of the old internet often leverage user generated data for profit               
using targeted-ads. As a result, virtually none of the value created by the user is shared with them.                  
That said, blockchain governance can provide utilitarian outcomes if deployed cautiously and            
strategically. 
 
Mobius gives its community of developers and end users the inalienable right to actively              
participate, propose, and vote on the future development of the underlying software. Any             
developer or end user in the Mobius community can submit a proposal for other community               
members to vote on. In order to generate a proposal for community consideration a minimum of                
8,888 Mobius is required. The rationale behind a minimum required amount of MOBI is to               
incentivize a vested stake in the network’s long term vitality.

The amount of token a community member holds is directly proportional to their voting power at                
any given time. It does not cost Mobius to exercise a vote for proposals. The community shall                 
define the cadence for proposal calls and votes. Overall, Mobius is a community driven effort.               
Where the voting power favors members (developers and end users alike) who accumulate             
MOBI, which can then decide on Mobius’ product development roadmap.  

8. Development Progress 
Mobius was entirely self-funded prior to the Pre-Sale. 
 
The first version of the Mobius Universal Blockchain Payment Protocol is in beta. If you are                
interested in using it please email beta@mobius.network. 

9. Roadmap 

 

10. MOBI Allocation Summary 
In the MOBI Smart Contract Token Generation 888,000,000 MOBI will be created. The majority              
of MOBI will be sold to the public or reserved for the community to incentivize network growth
