EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Betex was built with a mission of bringing clear-cut transparency to the financial derivatives markets 

as well as creating brand new instruments that would finally put an end to obsolete shady schemes. So 

now we are proud to introduce our leading-edge platform for peer-to-peer binary options, powered 

with  Ethereum smart contracts. 

Binary Options is a financial derivatives instrument that requires traders to correctly indicate the price 

movement direction for the underlying asset at a given point of time in the future. The forecasting 

horizon can vary from a few minutes to several months. 

Thousands of brokers and traders worldwide were massively employing this instrument back then. It 

was greatly favored for the simplicity of concept and high chances of success. The industry was 

experiencing exponential growth until 2014, reaching over $30 billion in its annual turnover. But 

something went wrong there. 

In the following years, regulators from all over the world have been making rather strong statements, 

claiming that binary options is a deceit and discouraging traders to get involved. Evidently, a great 

concept behind Binary Options has been ruined by shady, dishonest brokers, their lust for gain and the 

fact that there are limitless possibilities for them to deceive their customers. 

We have got good news for you, though. We are launching a revolutionary peer-to-peer platform for 

binary options, BETEX, that  will substantially improve the way betting is done. We designed a 

radically new business model to shift user mindset from worrying about the integrity of platform 

providers to focusing on own capacity to make profit. 

With Betex, traders will be placing bets against each other and never against platform providers or 

any other intermediaries. Built with Blockchain technology, unlike traditional platforms, Betex will 

provide access to real-time data, thereby, ensuring absolute transparency of its system. So there is no 

doubt that all users are treated equally and fairly. 

Users will be forming one large common pool of liquidity for each underlying asset in order to 

maximize users‘ gain. The platform‘s commission will be 5% only, the liquidity will be derived from 

a common pool of brokers, and brokers themselves will integrate into the platform via the white label 

mechanism. This is the only platform, where as much as 95% of funds are distributed among traders 

who make correct assumptions.  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02

We tried to create an interface as simple as possible. The process of placing a bet looks like this: a 

trader picks one of the trading pairs (Assets) and selects one of the six trade intervals (Time), then 

decides on the amount to bet (Bet Amount) and, finally, indicates in which direction the price will 

move: Up (Call) or Down (Put). 

Once the outcome of the forecast is known, the tokens of the traders who made the wrong prediction 

are divided among the traders who made the correct forecast of the price movement direction. At the 

same time, before paying the payouts, the platform charges a commission of 5% of the total amount of 

bets placed. 

During the two preliminary rounds of BETEX token sale, we expect to attract financing of $4.750 

million. This budget is planned for 1 year of active development and promotion of the project. 

According to our calculations, these funds will be sufficient to implement all the planned technical 

solutions, comply with certain applicable regulatory requirements, provide legal support, fund 

research, finance marketing activities, and cover operational expenses. 

In order to clearly demonstrate the benefits of the common pool of liquidity concept, already two 

instances of the platform has been launched as MVPs in the test net. They are located at 

https://Betex.io and https://GoBet.io. 

Powered by Ethereum smart contracts, Betex brings undisputable transparency, fair conduct, and 

auditable results to the binary options trading.

1. INTRODUCTION  

1.1. Binary options: basic concept 

Binary options is a financial derivatives instrument that challenges traders to foresee the right 

direction of the price movement for an underlying asset at a given point of time in the future. 

Forecasting horizon varies from a few minutes up to several months. 

To receive income for having defined the right direction, in which the price of an underlying asset 

happens to move, traders can use binary options instead of actually buying that asset. Thus, it is 

enough to forecast one of the two possible options — price increase or decrease. If the assumption is 

accurate for a given moment in time and asset price changes in the indicated direction, traders gain. 

And otherwise, they lose. 

Any trading pairs that are comprised of quotes (currencies, indices, stocks, metals, minerals, oil etc.) 

may be considered as basic assets for binary options. 

1.2. Historic and economic background 

The first regulated binary options took place in the US in 2008. In early May 2012, the Cyprus 

Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) included Binary Options to the list of financial 

instruments recognized by the law of the Republic of Cyprus on Investment Services, Investment 

Activities and Regulated Markets of 2007. 

Thousands of brokers and traders worldwide were massively  employing this instrument back then. It 

was greatly favored for the simplicity of concept and high chances of success. The industry was 

experiencing exponential growth until 2014, reaching tens of billions of dollars in its annual turnover.  

But something went wrong there. In the following years, regulators from all over the world have been 

making rather strong statements, claiming that binary options is a deceit and discouraging traders to 

get involved.  

For instance, 

American Regulators have issued a "Warning to Investors", which explained that legitimate platforms 

for binary options trading must be registered with authorities and comply with a set of rules. And yet, 

no web-platforms, brokers, or whatsoever, possess the relevant registration in the US.

‗The Times Of Israel‘ magazine has published a series of articles entitled "Wolves Of Tel Aviv: The 

Grand Immoral Cheating Of Binary Options", exposing the binary options industry as a big scam. 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission warns that ―online platforms for binary options mislead 

users, promising huge gains at a limited risk. In reality, users lose their money in days while 

companies make profits‖. 

1.3. Market overview  

According to the utmost conservative estimates, the volume for the world market of binary options is 

at least $30 billion per year, with almost $5 billion yearly in Japan alone. Exact estimation of this 

figure is not easy to obtain since in most countries there is no reliable data on the binary options 

market turnover because of its extreme shadiness and untruthfulness as well as the lack of clearing 

from the overwhelming number of brokers. 

Nonetheless, these days, binary options are no longer popular. Instead of building a user-centric, long-

lasting system for people to enjoy and benefit from, binary options have been often used to scam 

traders.  

Thus, despite the huge budgets spent on advertising, binary options have lost credibility. In some 

countries, they were given a semi-legal status. And even though there are no alternatives on the 

market, over the past three years there has been a significant decrease in brokers‘ revenues.

1.4. Current model: problems and disadvantages 

We have analyzed the traditional binary options model to get a better understanding of all the reasons, 

causing unfavourable attitude towards binary options and leading such a great idea to downfall.  

▸  Traders bet against brokers. So trader‘s loss is broker‘s gain. Hence, the reason for brokers to 

make sure traders mostly fail. There is a common belief that 90% of traders‘ funds eventually end 

up in brokers‘ pockets.    

▸  In general, trader‘s reward, in case he was right, stays fixed regardless of other factors, meaning, 

sometimes you should have had way more than did. Maximum that‘s ever available varies from 

75% to 90% of the rate. 

▸  Trading process takes place in a broker‘s backend, so it is not transparent. Such system allows 

manipulating data in a way that makes it difficult for anyone to find out the process was altered.  

▸  At times, it‘s required to make a deposit to start trading, what takes time. Withdrawal takes even 

more time. If funds get frozen, users have to order or buy something to be able to make 

withdrawal.  

▸  Quotations are often obtained from providers in a corrupt manner. And even then, it does not 

guarantee accuracy and validity of the given data. 

▸  Even if brokers treat you right, it is impossible to prove, making trust a critical factor in a 

decision-making process.

1.5. Betex model: solutions and benefits 

▸  Outcome of a bet makes no difference to us (as the platform provider), or to brokers, as neither of 

us can actively take part in the betting process. We charge service fees, while traders place bets 

against each other (peer-to-peer).  

▸  No deposits are required and an instant automatic withdrawal of funds is ensured. It is mainly 

possible due to the use of smart contracts. 

▸  Traders who accurately determine future changes are rewarded with 95% of funds. In case of 

success, trader‘s gain largely depends on the ratio of the correct and incorrect outcomes; 

▸  Both the platform and brokers can always prove authenticity and accuracy of the results. In the 

worst case scenario, if a mistake is made, it will be admitted or justified. Hence, it is no longer 

needed to trust each other to be sure terms are fair.  

▸  Trading is realized with ERC-20 tokens of stable value. It is stored and presented in the Ethereum 

blockchain, making it possible to audit the platform operations in real time, or later. Open access 

to data prevents intermediaries from altering results; 

▸  50% of the platform's profit made from commission is distributed among BETEX token holders. 

40% goes to brokers.  

▸  A composite rate, used in all calculations, is derived from several open sources by an established 

algorithm, considering the value of each source that is defined by trading volume. Using multiple 

sources makes entangles possible manipulations with the rate of an underlying asset, since they 

would have to be done in several places simultaneously. Working out of the composite rate is a 

completely open and transparent process: it is being logged and presented for public access in real 

time.

1.6. Plans and objectives  

One of the fundamentally important tasks for us is the relaunch of an existing market with a new 

technological groundwork through introduction and implementation of an honest, transparent and 

comprehensive business model, as well as all of its requirements. 

Dominating the market niche along with brokers, who engage with our platform by basic principles of 

the White Label is another critical goal to achieve.  

We aspire to become the primary force directly driving the declining market for binary options. We 

have come to a realization that there couldn‘t be a better time to begin with anything due to the crazy 

pace of life. 

We believe that our business model is, by all means, better than all the existing ones put together, 

clearly, within this market. We further believe that what we are experiencing today are those changes 

that will be heavily integrated by general markets in a year or so.  

Brokers who can see the upcoming transformations, already start getting used to transparency on all 

levels of life and learn to find the 2% commission fine. And not because they enjoy this much but 

because if they cannot keep up, they‘ll get extinct pretty soon, just like Nokia or Kodak.  

1.7. Mission 

BETEX is on a mission to bring clear-cut transparency to all financial markets and, that can 

conclusively eliminate the issue of trust. 

First and foremost, though, we strive to reinvent binary options through instilling incorruptible 

business logic into everybody‘s value system.

2. BETEX ECOSYSTEM 

Basically, you can access and interact with Betex ecosystem, being a:  

▸  Trader 

▸  Investor 

▸  Broker 

As the diagram below shows, all elements of the ecosystem are interconnected with Ethereum 

blockchain and smart contracts, which, in this case, play a role of backend. This form of organization 

provides many advantages but has one major drawback — the limited scalability. You will find more 

info on this subject in Section 3.5. 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017

2.1. Betex for Traders (Bettors) 

Users can access and interact with Betex via: 

▸  Web-based interface — ready; 

▸  Mobile applications — in development; 

▸  Desktop applications — in development; 

Here‘s how our web-based user interface looks like (night mode is available too): 

 

  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

14 

The interaction process is as follows:  

A trader selects one of the trading pairs (Assets), then selects one of the six trading intervals (Time), 

then decides on the amount to bet (Amount), and, finally, chooses a direction, in which the price will 

move, in his opinion (Call or Put ). 

As soon as the outcome is known, tokens of those traders, who happen to be mistaken, are distributed 

among traders, whose assumptions happen to be accurate. Yet, first, a fee of 5% of the total amount of 

bets placed is being charged for our services.  Elements of user interface, key functions, processes and 

principles of work, including examples, are presented in Section 4.6. 

2.2. Betex for investors 

Investors can interact with the platform through their personal dashboard where both platform‘s 

general and investor's personal statistics will be stored.  

After the main BETEX Token Sale (01.03.2018-31.03.2018) BETEX token holders will be receiving 

their share of the platform's profit made on commission (see section 7.3 for details). Number of tokens 

they own will directly define their share of the aggregate amount of distribution made to token 

holders.   

2.3. Betex for Brokers 

In the first quarter of 2018, brokers will be offered a ready-to-use solution allowing engaging with the 

platform by a known White Label principal. In other words, it will be possible to quickly implement 

all the mechanisms and systems of our platform with a broker‘s own domain and user base. Also, 

Betex Lab Limited, as a developer of the platform, will provide consultations and technical support.

3. BETEX TOKEN MECHANISM 

There are 2 tokens in the system: BETEX and SBT. 

3.1. Stable Betting Token (SBT) 

SBT (Stable Betting Token) is a token with a stable value of $1.00. This token is used for betting in 

the system, payments to winners and brokers. All operations are fixed in the Ethereum blockchain. 

The SBT tokens are issued automatically by the smart contract with each exchange request.  

With the reverse exchange, tokens are burned. Thus, the number of SBT tokens at each point of time 

reflects the current amount of funds in the system. 

3.2. Betex Token 

BETEX is the main token in the system. 50% of the platform‘s commission income is distributed 

among BETEX token holders in ETH. BETEX is issued once in the amount of 10,000,000 tokens. 

After that, its quantity remains constant. 

Two pre-sale rounds of BETEX token sale under the SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) 

are successfully completed.  

The profit received between the launch of the platform and the actual distribution of BETEX tokens, 

will be accumulated on the public Ethereum address and will be distributed among BETEX token 

holders during 2 weeks or less, after the distribution event is over. Distribution of BETEX tokens is 

planned to take place in April of 2018. 

 

 

4. BETEX PLATFORM 

4.1. Business model 

Betex is an innovative peer-to-peer platform for financial derivatives trading, using Ethereum smart 

contracts. Binary options will serve as the primary derivatives to begin with. Later on, other more 

complex instruments will be integrated. 



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

16 

Unlike trading the traditional binary options, Betex users place bets against each other. To our 

knowledge, this is the only platform, where as much as 95% of funds are distributed among traders, 

who make correct assumptions. Besides, they are forming a large common pool of liquidity for each 

underlying asset in order to maximize users‘ gain. 

Powered by Ethereum smart contracts, Betex brings undisputable transparency, fair conduct and 

auditable results to the Binary Options trading. 5% of the amount of the transactions (bets) is the 

platform‘s commission income. 

All operations in the system are performed in the SBT Ethereum tokens of the ERC-20 standard with 

a stable value of $1.00. 

COMMON POOL OF LIQUIDITY 

For each trading pair all kinds of brokers will be brought together to form one common pool of 

liquidity, instead of making multiple tiny ones. This business model lets brokers work jointly, as a 

single unit, yet doesn‘t require transferring their users elsewhere. 

This is possible due to all bets being placed with SBT Ethereum tokens and then kept in the Ethereum 

blockchain system. All transactions are public and available for verification at any time. No one, 

including the platform providers, can alter the process. 

Thus, forming a common pool of liquidity by using Ethereum smart contracts, will finally eliminate 

the need in trusting each other throughout  the process and makes manipulations impossible, while 

maintaining high liquidity for each trading pair.  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

17 

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMON POOL 

The Betex platform earns on commissions from each transaction (bet). The commission is 5% of the 

amount of each transaction (bet). The distribution of the total amount of transaction (bet) funds, 

including the commission income, is presented below. 

▸  95% of the turnover will form the reward fund for traders. These funds will be paid out to traders 

automatically, once each round is over. 

▸  2.5% of the total platform turnover will be distributed among the holders of BETEX tokens, 

according to the number of tokens they own. 

▸  2.0% will be granted to the brokers, connected to our platform. Payments for the referrals will be 

deducted from broker‘s commission. 

▸  0.3% will go to the permanent contributions to the project‘s development fund. A year after the 

commercial launch, the project should break even. 

▸  0.2% of the platform‘s turnover will be transferred to the reserve fund.  Its regular refill (from 

each transaction) will cover unexpected costs, if they arise.

ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BUSINESS MODEL 

Betex business model is designed to minimize the risks of operational loss, for any number of brokers 

and platform users, regardless of the nature of the events and outcomes which users are betting on. 

The commission model for generating income at minimal costs provides flexibility to adjust the 

balance sheet regardless of the platform‘s turnover. 

CHANNELS FOR USER ATTRACTION AND PLATFORM GROWTH 

Each sample of the platform is managed by an appropriate broker. Betex platform will have its own 

broker who will run the websites https://Betex.io and https://GoBet.io. Also, there will be third-party 

brokers involved through the White Label system. Terms and conditions will be equal for all of them. 

The following channels will be used for user attraction to the platforms of their own brokers: 

▹  Telegram chatbots 

▹  Banner advertising 

▹  Google 

▹  Advertising on specialized forums 

▹  Facebook  

▹  Twitter 

▹  Referral program 

Third-party brokers will have access to the entire set of tools for user engagement. Each new user of 

our broker is a new user of the platform, too, as it is increasing the commission income of both 

platforms. It is a win-win approach. 

In the end, we expect the vast majority of users to get involved through the third-party brokers. Their 

management will allow launching a big number of the platform samples that will yet be offering the 

same trading pairs and intervals, as well as work with one common pool of liquidity.

4.2. Architecture and technology 

Betex architecture is based on two major parts: 

▸  Smart contract systems (to ensure transparency of bets). 

▸  An oracle providing the reliable data on occurring events to a smart contract (in particular, 

exchange rates). 

SMART CONTRACTS ARCHITECTURE 

Main purpose of smart contracts is ensuring a transparent betting mechanism for the common pool of 

liquidity. Smart contracts were built under the following restrictions: 

▸  The bet occurs by means of transferring the SBT token into a common liquidity pool for a given 

event in the system; 

▸  The network commission (Ethereum) should be as small as possible; 

▸  Reward payout (including the transfer of the commission) is realized by a smart contract based on 

the data received from the oracle. 

The architectural system is based on the following smart contracts: 

▸  SBT token contract complies with ERC-20 standard. SBT is a stable (relatively to the USD rate) 

token, the exchange rate of which is artificially maintained, with emissions and burning made 

during the exchange operations. 

▸  Exchange contract is a smart contract for automatic exchange of ETH to SBT and vice versa. 

ETH/SBT rate is regularly updated with an oracle and artificially maintained at 1:1 / USD level. 

When crediting ETH, the required amount of SBT is being emitted. When withdrawing ETH, 

corresponding amount of SBT tokens is being burned. 

▸  It is also planned to implement time restrictions on the token use. If the token is not used in the 

Betex system for a certain period of time, it is automatically exchanged back to the ETH source 

address. This may prevent speculations with tokens.

▸  Betex smart contract is a management system for liquidity pools (betting baskets). It  accepts bids 

by moving SBT token to a specific pool (basket) for a limited period of time. After the waiting 

time has expired, the payout is redistributed among the players based on the oracle data. 

▸  Commission smart contract is the contract-aggregator of commission fees. It charges the entire 

commission from operations in the system. The distribution of the commission is made by this 

contract once in a certain period of time (currently, once in 24 hours). 

▸  Referral smart contract is contract managing the referral program. Betex supports a single-level 

referral program and redistributes part of the commission to the referral addresses. This smart 

contract stores the necessary dependencies. 

The implementation of smart contracts is carried out considering all modern practices and approaches, 

including the overflow checks, 100% test coverage and statistical control of Gas used. 

MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY POOLS. POOL‘S LIFECYCLE.  

Each pool of liquidity (basket) in the Betex system has following time characteristics: 

▹  Time for bet placements; 

▹  Waiting time for exit; 

These time intervals are limited by: 

▹  The moment of opening; 

▹  The moment of closing; 

▹  The moment of payment; 

From the point of view of a smart contract, each of these moments is implemented using a special 

system transaction. The problem here is the uncontrolled time of the transaction (from the time it hits 

the tx pool to the time it was confirmed), as well as the allowable deviation of the system variable 

(solidity block.timestamp) in 900 seconds compared to the real time.   



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

21 

The lifecycle of a pool includes the following: 

▹  Opening/creating a pool 

During realization of the Betex smart contract it was decided to give up transaction at the moment of 

opening the pool for the sake of creating a system of identifiers. Thus, in order to execute a bet, you 

only need to know the pool ID. If there is no pool at the time of the bet, it will be created 

automatically. 

▹  Closing the pool 

Closing the pool is implemented using a system transaction, which is carried out from a 

predetermined address (and is part of the Betex smart contract management system). The closure 

essentially means a ban on accepting bets from a certain moment. Closing the pool should occur faster 

with respect to other transactions (including bets), so this transaction is conducted with an increased 

gas price. 

▹  Payouts  

Payouts are realized using a system transaction (or series of transactions), which is conducted from a 

predefined address. The calculation of winnings and the transfer of tokens is carried out inside the 

smart contract, so, potentially, such a transaction may not be invested in the gas limit of the block 

(with a large number of bets), so the system has the opportunity to pay winnings by sending a series 

of transactions, which makes it possible to work with a large number of users. 

BETS 

The betting process is a transaction of transferring tokens to the address of the Betex smart contract, 

indicating the type of bet and the pool ID. The bet is accepted by the system until the pool is closed. 

Bet options 

At the moment, the system supports 2 types of bets — on growth and falling. In the future, we plan to 

expand this list to support bets for other types of events.

SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS 

Since transactions are accepted and confirmed by the network in asynchronous mode, it creates a 

number of problems when the system is running. Let's view them in more details using the figure 

below.  

 

 

  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

23 

When processing the transaction Bet 1, the pool is in the open state, and it‘s long enough until the 

closing time for the transaction to get the network confirmation. As we, technically, do not limit users 

in the bets until the basket is closed (it's possible to bet earlier, not later), the bet will be considered 

successful. 

When processing the Bet 2 transaction, the pool is also in the open state, but the transaction may fail 

to receive confirmation before the pool is closed. In this case, transactions Bet 2 and close are in the tx 

pool simultaneously at a certain point of time. 

The gas price of the close transaction is selected by the Betex system higher than the rest of the 

transactions (including the bet transactions), so the probability of confirming the transaction close is 

higher than that of the Bet 2 transaction. If the pool has time to close before confirmation of the Bet 2 

transaction, the bet will not occur, even if formally the user sent the transaction until the pool was 

closed. 

When processing the transaction Bet 3, the pool is still in the open state, because transaction close is 

not yet approved by the network. But, as in the case of Bet 2, the probability of Bet 3 confirmation is 

lower than that of transaction close, so the probability of Bet 3 rejection will be higher than its 

acceptance. 

POOL CLOSING ATTACK 

The only way to place a bet into the pool at the time when the close transaction has already been sent 

is to set a larger gas price for the bet transaction than the close transaction. In the same way, you can 

hammer the tx pool of the Ethereum network with transactions with a large gas price, without giving 

the opportunity to confirm the transaction close. In general, this kind of user behavior is possible, yet 

it is costly and time-consuming. To protect Betex system from such attacks, we have implemented 

two principles: 

▸  The time intervals chosen for waiting for pools are sufficiently large; 

▸  Gas price of the close transaction is determined by total bet amount in a pool. 

Thus, the price of attack increases until it gets unreasonable in terms of costs.

ORACLE 

The basis for deciding the outcome of each round in the Betex system is the resulting composite rate 

(Outcome Rate) provided by the oracle, so the oracle is a critical component of the system that is 

located separately from the rest of its parts. The work of the oracle is built on the principle of 

publicity and transparency. The results of its work (in the form of payment transactions) will be 

available for verification through the blockchain explorer (etherescan.io for the Ethereum network). 

Every time, the Betex composite rate is calculated as the average weighted of the exchange rates on 

the main exchanges. Each trading pair has a separate list of exchanges with significant volume for this 

particular pair. Thereby, the weight factor is trade volume on each of the exchanges. 

In case one of the exchanges stops delivering data on the rates, its rate (the latter value) continues to 

participate in determining the composite rate, the strike rate of which includes the data of this 

exchange. This prevents sharp artificial jumps of the composite rate due to the redistribution of weight 

values. 

With a fixed rate from one data provider, the courses of the remaining suppliers continue to move the 

composite course according to the current market situation. This is how we smooth out such an 

abnormal situation as correctly as possible. 

If the data supply by this exchange is not resumed by the start of the new round, the strike rate will be 

calculated already not considering the rate from this exchange. Thus, such data provider will be 

temporarily "disqualified" in the Betex system. 

For each oracle in the Betex system, we also plan to publish the source data and the methodology for 

obtaining the result, according to which the composite rate was calculated at each time point.

4.3. Audience 

A very wide range of people from the world of traditional financial instruments and the world of 

cryptocurrencies can become the users of the Betex platform. These are millions of people all around 

the globe. Everyone who is interested in investments, finance, and trading on exchanges, are our 

potential customers. 

The owners of services with ready-made user bases will also be interested in the platform, because 

they can quickly deploy the platform and start earning commissions from the first day of work 

without transferring their use base anywhere. First of all, this concerns existing brokers of binary 

options. 

4.4. Use Cases 

The business model, architecture, and smart contracts of the Betex platform are built in such a way 

that they can also be applied in related areas. We are considering the following alternative ways of 

using the Betex platform: 

▹  Other types of binary options; 

▹  Other derivatives; 

▹  Betting on sports events; 

▹  Betting on cyber sports events (eSports); 

▹  Betting on irregular events; 

▹  Betting for financial indicators; 

▹  Betting on any other quantitative or qualitative indicators that imply the final small number of 

options and were not listed above.

4.5. Platform Scalability 

The Betex platform was originally designed in such a way that the increase in the number of trading 

pairs, users, brokers and transactions, the speed and quality of the platform is not affected. This 

applies to both the hardware and network infrastructure, as well as the architecture of software 

components. 

At the moment, considering the average load of the Ethereum network at the level of 50%-60% and 

the average gas volume necessary for the platform operation, the maximum amount of transactions 

per day without increasing the Ethereum network capacity is about 100,000. 

We have several possible solutions for the platform‘s scalability: 

▸  Upgrade of the Ethereum network that will allow the capacity increase;  

▸  Transition to an alternative block system if it also offers smart contracts or similar solutions that 

will allow the business logic of the platform to be implemented at a higher rate and/or at a lower 

cost; 

▸  Transition to our own specialized blockchain that will be able to provide the platform with a level 

of transparency and reliability not lower than the current one and at the same time it will be 

sharpened directly to the needs of the platform. 

The fulfillment of the first two conditions does not depend on us in any way. Our team monitors the 

situation in terms of significant changes. 

As for the latest point, work is being done in this direction. At the moment, we are at the initial stage. 

The results should appear in the second half of 2018. All issues should be resolved within a year.

4.6. Description of MVP (released) 

Currently, it is already possible to try the work of the platform in action. In order to clearly 

demonstrate the benefits of the common pool of liquidity, two samples of the platform were launched 

as MVPs in the test net: https://Betex.io and https://GoBet.io. 

There are 3 trading pairs and 6 trading intervals available within the MVP framework. 

Trading pairs: 

▸  BTC/USD 

▸  ETH/USD 

▸  BTC/ETH 

Trading intervals: 

▸  5m+25m 

▸  15m+2h45m 

▸  30m+5h30m 

▸  1h+11h 

▸  3h+21h 

▸  1d+6d 

Each trading interval consists of two sub-intervals: during the first one, traders bet on the growth or 

lowering of the rate (5m), and after the second one (25m), the platform determines the winners and 

distributes the bets of the losers between them. 

 

At the end of this section, an example of a round is shown, which demonstrates the work of the Betex 

platform more clearly.

INTERFACE ELEMENTS OVERVIEW 

1 - Header - In this block, you see the available balance of ETHEREUM and SBT tokens that you 

can use for bets. Also, here is a link to the profile, by clicking on which you can make a token 

exchange and see statistics on referrals. 

2 - Assets - This block contains a list of available trading pairs (basic assets). The current composite 

rate is displayed next to each trading pair respectively. 

 

 

3 - Composite rate - This block displays the current composite rate of the selected trading pair (the 

basic asset). The oracle of this block is engaged in constant monitoring of the rates on the main 

exchanges (each trading pair has a separate list of exchanges with significant volume for this 

particular pair).  

At each moment of time, the Betex composite rate is calculated as the weighted average of the 

exchange rates on the main exchanges. Thereby, the weight factor is the trade volume on each of the 

exchanges. The ratio of the trading volumes is visually displayed using a diagram. 

The list of exchanges rates used in the composite rate calculation is displayed under the diagram. For 

each exchange, the rate and weight (in %) in the composite course are displayed respectively. Such 

approach makes it difficult for individual traders/exchanges to manipulate the exchange rate and 

makes the platform more transparent and fair.

4 - Price chart - This chart is a graphical display of the history of changes in the composite exchange 

rate of the basic asset for the selected period, as well as the display of the current exchange rate. 

5 - Current state of the pool - This block displays the status of the total bet pool for the current 

round for the selected trading pair and time slot. For each of the two types of betting (up and down), 

the amount of bets in the current round, the bet/interest ratio, and the number of bets are displayed.  

The state of this block is updated after each new block appears in the Ethereum network. Reward ratio 

of those traders who won in the current round is based on the ratio of the sum of the bets for each of 

the outcomes. 

6 - Time period - In this block, you can select one of the six time intervals for placing bets. At the 

bottom of the block for the selected interval, the time remaining until the end of the bets in the current 

round is displayed, as well as the total pool of the current bets. 

7 - Strike rate - This block shows basic rate of a current trading pair, time slot and round. At the end 

of the round, this rate determines where the price went — up or down. 

8 - Bet amount input - In this block, there is a field for entering the betting amount. On the right side 

of this block, the current coefficients and the amount of possible wins are displayed with a bet on each 

of the outcomes. The important point here is that these values are not final and can change until the 

current round is open for bets. This is due to the fact that the winning ratio is determined based on the 

ratio of the sums of the rates for growth and the rates for a decrease. 

9 - Option types - In this block, there are 2 buttons with which you actually place the bet in the 

system after you have decided on the trading pair, the time interval and the betting amount.  

By pressing the green "Call" button, you bet that the composite rate at the end of the current round 

(Outcome Rate) will be higher than the basic rate (Strike Rate), which was fixed at the beginning of 

the current round. 

By pressing the red "Put" button, you bet that the composite rate at the end of the current round 

(Outcome Rate) will be lower than the basic rate (Strike Rate), which was fixed at the beginning of 

the current round 

10 - Your orders - This is a table that displays your current open bets. This table also shows closed 

bets. To view thee closed bets, you must press the switch on the right side of this block to the 

"Expired" position. Here‘s a brief description of the columns of this table:

EXAMPLE 

Let's take a look at an example of how the platform works. 

Initial data for the example: 

Trading pair - BTC/USD 

Time interval - 5m + 25m 

The start time of the current round - 12:00 

The time to stop accepting bets in the current round is 12:05 

The end time of the current round is 12:30 

The composite rate at the beginning of the round (Strike Rate) - $7154.5844 

The composite rate at the end of the round (Outcome Rate) - $7195.2557 

Trader_1:  

12:01:30 

$100.00 

Call 

Trader_2: 

 12:02:17 

 $200.00 

 Call 

Trader_3: 

12:04:10 

$600.00 

Put 

 

At the end of this round, we get the following results: 

Trader_1 and Trader_2 are the winners. 

The total pool size before deduction of the Betex commission is $900.00. 

Betex platform commission is 5%, or $45.00. 

Total pool size after deduction of the Betex commission $855.00 

Trader_1 will receive 855 * 100/300 = $285.00 

Trader_2 will receive 855 * 200/300 = $570.00

4.7. White label solution for brokers 

The solution for brokers will be provided via the White Label system. This approach will allow the 

Betex platform to attract a critical mass of users as soon as possible, as well as have representatives in 

all strategically important regions. 

The advantages of this solution for broker companies are as follows: 

▸  lack of significant financial expenses, as you will work under our ‗white-label‘ gambling license; 

▸  completely legal scheme of cooperation; 

▸  possibility of an increased income of your company; 

▸  promotion of our technological solution under your own brand; 

▸  connection to a common pool of liquidity. 

The role of the broker in the Betex ecosystem is reduced to attracting traders to their platform. All the 

rest is provided by Betex Lab Limited. 

Detailed terms of cooperation for brokers will be published in a separate document before the 

commercial launch of the solution.

5. FEES 

All commission payments on the platform are paid by the user. In case the user initiates the 

transaction, he pays the commission personally. In case the platform is an initiator, commission is 

paid by the platform, but it is deducted from the payment to the user. 

As all operations on the platform implying commission payouts are made in the Ethereum network, 

commission in dollars depends on 2 main parameters: the amount of gas required for the operation 

and the gas price in the gwei (gas price). 

As the price of gas is set by the initiator of the transaction, for convenience of calculations, we will 

take the optimal gas price at the current moment — 8 gwei. Then the commission expenses, 

depending on the type of operation, will be the following: 

▸  Exchange of ETH or other cryptocurrency to the SBT token. The commission will equal to 40,000 

gas or about $0.1. 

▸  Placing a bet on the platform in SBT tokens. The commission will make up 120,000 - 240,000 gas 

or $0.32- $0.64. 

▸  Closing the basket of bets. Transaction commission for the basket closure will be distributed 

equally among the winners of the corresponding round, and deducted from their winnings. The 

commission will be equal to 45,000 gas or about $0.12. 

▸  Income payouts in SBT tokens. The amount of commission depends on the number of bets in the 

pool in the current round and is approximately 80,000 gas or $0.21 in case of 1 winner. 

▸  Referral reward payouts  in SBT tokens. The size of the commission is still unknown. The 

commission is deducted from the amount of the referral reward. 

▸  Reverse exchange of the SBT token to ETH or other cryptocurrency. The commission will equal 

to 40,000 gas or about $0.1. 

Please bear in mind that these numbers are approximate and subject to change.

6. COMPETITION ANALYSIS 

As of the date of this Whitepaper, there are no direct competitors with similar to Betex functions and 

features. 

6.1. Advantages of the betex platform 

▸  Transparency 

Blockchain technology provides open access to information at all times, thereby, ensuring fully 

transparent process, accurate data, fair and equal terms.  

▸  Provable fairness 

Since we are not betting, there is no reason for us to manipulate results. Whatever is the outcome 

of your bet, we profit from collecting service fees. 

▸  Common pool of liquidity 

The goal is to consolidate maximum liquidity from the derivative markets through forming one 

common pool of liquidity for each trading asset, instead of creating multiple tiny ones. 

▸  White label for brokers 

This system allows quick connection of the brokers who contribute to maintaining high liquidity 

and ensure the increase in the turnover of the platform in a short time and at low costs. 

▸  No deposits 

Platform users get instant access to all of its functions and features without having to make any 

kind of deposits first. 

▸  Instant payouts 

Payments are automatically released by smart contracts straight to your ETH wallet, ensuring 

immediate withdrawals without delays or cancellations.  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

35 

▸  Built-in exchange 

Since all operations in the system are carried out in an Ethereum-token with a stable SBT value, a 

built-in exchanger is used for exchange of other cryptocurrencies and tokens to the SBT and back 

on the platform.  

▸  Referral program 

The platforms offers a single-level referral program. The bonus size is chosen by the broker and 

usually equals 0.5%. Thus, user can get up to 0.5% from the turnover of the person referred by 

him. 

▸  Self-financed model 

0.5% from the overall turnover is used for the platform‘s support and its development. 

▸  Scalability 

Betex platform is designed in such a way that, when the load increases, it does not affect the 

performance of the platform. This is achieved by the correct organization of the smart contracts, 

internal architecture and hardware platform. 

▸  AWS infrastructure 

The infrastructure placement on Amazon provides a high level of reliability, hardware scaling, 

speed of delivery of content to anywhere in the world and ultimately forms a positive user 

experience.

6.2. Betex vs. traditional binary options platforms 

Betex business model is fundamentally different from traditional binary options: 

BETEX MODEL  TRADITIONAL MODEL 

Traders bet against each other (P2P), brokers 

receive commission, platform providers profit 

from service fees. 

Traders bet against the broker. Trader‘s loss is the 

broker‘s gain. 

Brokers operate with the same trading pairs in 

the common liquidity pool. 

Brokers operate separately, not being connected 

with each other in any way.  

Rewards for traders depend on overall state of 

the common pool of liquidity. 

Fixed reward, which is known in advance in case 

of the win. 

Half of the commission income of the platform 

is distributed in SBT tokens among the BETEX 

tokens holders. 

The whole brokers income remains with the 

broker. 

Trading process is carried out with ERC-20 SBT 

token. Records are available in Ethereum 

blockchain. 

The whole trading process is carried out in the 

broker‘s backend, hence, it is not transparent or 

provably fair. 

No deposits. Instant automatic payouts. To start trading it is required to make a deposit, 

then wait for withdrawal. 

Strike and outcome rates are provided by public 

sources, given the weight of source that depends 

on trade volume. 

Strike rate and outcome rate are provided by the 

liquidity provider without any transparency.

6.3. Betex vs. prediction markets 

Over the past year, several projects implementing the model of the prediction markets have appeared. 

Such projects are Augur, Gnosis, Stox and others. 

While the prediction markets are platforms, on which everyone is trying to do something that can be 

used and provides the initial liquidity for the created market, Betex is a specialized, ready-to-use 

solution. 

An important difference and advantage of the BETEX platform is the availability of a common pool 

of liquidity and moderation of events/trading pairs. A situation when the same event is duplicated 

more than once is impossible on the Betex platform. 

Another distinctive feature is the model of user attraction through brokers who do not need to do 

anything, except for inviting customers to a platform that can work under their own brand.

7. HOW BETEX CAN BE PROFITABLE 

7.1. For traders (Bettors) 

Traders can earn by using the platform for its intended purpose if they correctly indicate a short- or 

medium-term trend in the price change of the selected basic asset (trading pair). 

Unlike most centralized systems, the size of a trader's earnings in case of a correct forecast depends 

on the state of the general liquidity pool (rates of other traders) and can range from several percent to 

several tens of times. The size of the win is limited only by the volume of the general pool of rates 

and the ratio of the number of bets to each of the outcomes. 

Also, one of the possible options for making profit for traders can be using the platform along with 

trade operations with the basic asset on one of the exchanges. In this case, the bets on the platform can 

hedge the risks of their trading operations on the exchanges. 

An additional source of income for a trader, if desired, can become a referral program, which is 

usually up to 0.5% of the betting amount of the referred user. The decision on the referral bonus is 

made by the broker. 

7.2. For brokers 

Brokers connected to the BETEX platform receive a commission of 2% of the total amount of their 

users' bets. Thus, brokers are directly interested in increasing their turnover, as the broker earnings 

depend on it. The larger the turnover, the more earnings a broker gets.  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

39 

7.3. For investors 

In this section, investors should be understood as all holders of BETEX tokens. The income of the 

BETEX token holder can consist of the two components: 

Permanent automatic commission payments in the amount of 2.5% of the total volume on the 

platform. Each BETEX token holder automatically receives a share of this commission proportionate 

to the share of tokens he holds in the aggregate number of BETEX tokens. 

Possible increase of the BETEX token value along with growing platform turnover. The dependence 

of possible BETEX token value on daily turnover of the platform (together with brokers) is presented 

in paragraph 10.2.

8. ROADMAP 

8.1. Current state 

Betex project has been under development for more than a year so far. During this time, the project 

has overcome a long way from an idea to an MVP. 

Before the result was achieved, there were many iterations, each out of which allowed to improve the 

features of the platform. This process continues even now. 

At the moment, the website with the project description (https://Betexlab.com) is live. Two samples of 

the MVP platform in the test net are launched and can be found at https://Betex.io and 

https://GoBet.io. Two copies of the platform are needed to demonstrate the concept of a common 

liquidity pool. 

Within the MVP, the design of the web interface, smart contracts, and platform architecture are 

developed. The hardware infrastructure is based on the Amazon Web Services. Three trading pairs 

(BTC/USD, ETH/USD, BTC/ ETH) and 6 time intervals, lasting from half an hour to a week, are 

launched. 

8.2. Future development

9. TOKEN SALE 

9.1. Crowdsale summary 

BETEX token sale will be carried out in two preliminary stages and one main stage. 

▸  BETEX Token Pre-Sale, Round 1 (04.12.17 - 08.01.18) 

▸  BETEX Token Pre-Sale, Round 2 (10.01.18 - 18.02.18) 

▸  BETEX Token Sale (01.03.2018 – 31.03.2018) 

During the preliminary rounds of BETEX tokens sale, the tokens will not be transferred to the buyers. 

According to the SAFT (or similar) agreement, the tokens will be transferred to the contributors later, 

after they are generated. 

After the main round of BETEX token sale, the BETEX tokens will be issued and transferred to the 

buyers directly within 7 days after TGE (Token Generation Event). 

Important! The sale of BETEX tokens during ALL rounds is subject to satisfactory KYC/AML 

procedure. 

Any of the BETEX tokens that are not sold during one of the rounds will remain at the company‘s 

disposal.

auction. Distribution will be done automatically by the smart-contract once the token 

sale ends.

10. FINANCE 

10.1. Use of the sale proceeds 

During the two pre-sale rounds of selling BETEX tokens, we expect to attract funding of $ 4.750 

million. Distribution of project costs is shown in the diagram below. 

 

 

This budget is designed for 1 year of active development and promotion of the project. According to 

our calculations, these funds will be sufficient to implement all planned technical solutions, comply 

with certain applicable regulatory requirements, provide legal support, fund research, finance 

marketing activities and cover operational expenses.

10.2. Dependence of the value of the Betex token on the daily turnover 

In the table below, we have summarized some quantitative indicators showing the dependence of one 

BETEX token value on the daily turnover of the platform and personal expectations of the ROI. 

 

 

For example, with a daily turnover of $100,000, the commission income will be $2,500 per day or 

2,500/10,000,000 = $0.00025 per day for 1 BETEX token. With a token price of $2.00, this gives us a 

yield of 4.6% per annum. 

  

Thus, having the turnover of the platform and the desired profitability, everyone will be able to decide 

what price of the BETEX token is fair at this point in time. 

Information about the platform‘s turnover will be publicly accessible.

12. LEGAL NOTES 

12.1. Betex legal structure 

BETEX platform described in this Whitepaper will be developed by Betex Lab Limited (a company 

incorporated in Hong Kong) or such other company, which we may establish in other jurisdiction for 

regulatory or other reasons. Betex Lab Limited or, as the case may be, such other company will 

provide services to end users, and as brokers are connected, it will enter into contracts with their 

management companies, provide them with Betex technology and connect them to a common pool of 

liquidity. 

12.2. Disclaimer 

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT AS 

OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING BY US, (A) BETEX TOKENS ARE SOLD ON AN ―AS 

IS‖ AND ―AS AVAILABLE‖ BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND WE 

EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AS TO BETEX TOKENS, 

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT; (B) WE DO 

NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT BETEX TOKENS ARE RELIABLE, CURRENT OR 

ERROR-FREE, MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT DEFECTS IN BETEX TOKENS 

WILL BE CORRECTED; AND (C) WE CANNOT AND DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT 

THAT BETEX TOKENS OR THE DELIVERY MECHANISM FOR THEM ARE FREE OF 

VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. 

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you purchase, 

offer or sell any BETEX tokens. You must also obtain any consents, permissions or approvals that 

you need in order to purchase, offer or sell any BETEX tokens under the laws and regulations in force 

in any jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchases, offers or sales. We 

are not responsible for your compliance with these legal requirements. We are not making any 

representation to you regarding the legality of your investment in the BETEX tokens under any legal 

investment or similar law or regulation in any jurisdiction.

12.3. Risk factors  

General 

An investment in BETEX and/or SBT Tokens carries with it significant risk. You should carefully 

consider all of the information in this Whitepaper, including the following risk factors, as well as 

terms of the SAFT agreement or any other document related to sale of the BETEX tokens, before 

deciding to invest in the BETEX and/or SBT tokens. The actual occurrence of any of the following 

events could have a material adverse effect on development of BETEX platform, BETEX‘s business, 

prospects and results of operations, which may adversely affect your ability to receive gains or returns 

on your investment. 

Most of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur, and we are not in a position to 

express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. The risks described below are not 

exhaustive and are only those that we believe are principal, but these may not be the only risks and 

uncertainties that BETEX may face. Additional risks that are not currently known or anticipated or 

that are currently deemed insignificant may also have a material adverse effect on development of 

BETEX platform, BETEX‘s business, prospects and results of operations. You could therefore lose a 

substantial portion or all of your investment in the BETEX and/or SBT tokens. Consequently, an 

investment in the BETEX and/or SBT tokens should only be considered by persons who can assume 

such risks. Prior to participation, carefully consider the potential risks and, to the extent necessary, 

consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional to evaluate the risk entailed.  

The token economy is relatively new and incredibly innovative. Tokens could be impacted by 

regulatory actions, including restrictions on ownership, use, or possession. There is no guarantee that 

BETEX and/or SBT tokens purchased will increase in value, provide a return, or will have sufficient 

adoption and liquidity to enable exchange for other assets. Ethereum, on which BETEX and SBT 

tokens are based, is an experimental technology and all possible future risks cannot be enumerated 

here. We do not assume responsibility for any losses that may occur. Please exercise caution with all 

cryptographic assets and do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. 

WE MAKE NO PROMISES OF POSSIBLE GAINS OR RETURNS. YOU CAN POTENTIALLY 

LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY IF THE MARKET PRICE OF BETEX TOKEN DROPS TO ZERO.  



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

52 

Risk of Losing Access to BETEX and/or SBT Due to Loss of Private Key(s) 

BETEX and SBT Tokens are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. You must access and use 

them using an ERC20-compliant wallet. It is your responsibility not to lose your Tokens by losing 

access to the keys which allow access to your wallet and/or allowing malicious third parties to access 

your keys and/or your wallet. WE WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF TOKENS 

AND/OR OTHER DAMAGE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS OF KEY OR 

ATTACK ON YOUR WALLET. 

Risks Associated with the Ethereum Blockchain 

Because BETEX and SBT are based on the Ethereum blockchain, any malfunction, breakdown or 

abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on BETEX Platform 

and its tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of 

quantum computing, could present risks to BETEX Platform by rendering ineffective the 

cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum blockchain. 

Risks Associated with Licensing 

Operation and sustainable development of the BETEX platform will depend on the continuing validity 

of any necessary licences in the jurisdictions of its operation, as well as its compliance with the terms 

of such licences. Although we intend to apply for the necessary licences, there is a risk that licences 

needed for BETEX business may not be issued in a timely fashion or at all or may be subject to 

onerous conditions. Further, even if the licence is issued there can be no assurance that it will not be 

subsequently recalled or that it will be successfully renewed. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew 

necessary licences may have a material adverse effect on BETEX‘s business, prospects and results of 

operations. 

Risks Associated with Volatility of Cryptocurrencies  

We allow investments for the development of the BETEX to be made in cryptocurrency, such as 

Bitcoin and Ether. As a general matter, the rate at which any such cryptocurrency can be exchanged 

into fiat currency is extremely volatile. While we will exercise our management skills to the 

maximum extent possible when spending the collected cryptocurrency or exchanging it into fiat 

currency for the purposes of the platform development needs, there can be no guarantee that we will 

not lose part or entire value of the investments because of decrease in cryptocurrencies‘ value at a 

particular point of time.  

 



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

53 

Risk of Mining Attacks  

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain, BETEX and/or 

SBT are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating transactions on the Ethereum 

blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and 

selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the BETEX Platform, including, but 

not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving BETEX and/or SBT. 

Risk of Uninsured Losses 

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, BETEX and/or SBT are 

uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or 

loss of token value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to 

you. 

Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions 

The regulatory status of ERC-20 Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in 

many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing 

regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how 

or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting 

distributed ledger technology and its applications. Regulatory actions could negatively impact 

BETEX Platform in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a 

determination that the purchase, sale, delivery or use of BETEX and/or SBT constitutes unlawful 

activity, or that registration or licensing is required for some or all of the parties involved in the 

purchase, sale, delivery or use of BETEX and/or SBT. BETEX may cease operations in a jurisdiction 

in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such 

jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such 

jurisdiction. 

Risks Arising from Taxation 

The tax characterization of BETEX Token is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in 

connection with purchasing BETEX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including 

withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.  

 

 



 

Betex Whitepaper v2.02 

27 Nov 2017 

54 

Risk of Competing Platforms 

It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code 

underlying the BETEX Platform. BETEX Platform may compete with these alternative platforms, 

which could negatively impact the adoption of the BETEX Platform.  

Risk of Insufficient Interest in BETEX Platform Applications 

It is possible that BETEX Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and 

other entities or that there will be limited public interest. Such a lack of use or interest could 

negatively impact the development of BETEX Platform. 

Risks arising from no redemption of the BETEX tokens  

The owners of the BETEX tokens will not have the right to compel the BETEX platform to redeem 

the tokens. While the owners of the BETEX tokens may resell the tokens to other parties (subject to 

any applicable transfer restrictions), in case the secondary market for these tokens is not developed for 

a long time or at all, investors in BETEX tokens must be prepared to bear the risks of an investment in 

tokens for an extended period of time and loss of the investment or its part.

13. CONCLUSION 

Our team has developed what it believes to be the most honest, transparent and attractive type of 

binary options for users, which will restore the lost confidence in this derivative and bring its 

popularity to a new level. 

In the nearest future, we aim to make it possible to use transparent peer-to-peer binary options for the 

most popular cryptocurrency pairs. MVP is already available in the test network. Upon completion of 

testing, a commercial launch will take place. 

In the mid-term, the potential of the platform will allow to bring several more revolutionary financial 

products to the market that will be built on the same principles of transparency, financial 

attractiveness, and ease of use.
