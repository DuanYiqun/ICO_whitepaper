And has it ever occured to you that every time you 
publish branded content on social media, you are
supporting the values of a particular brand? 

It’s something powerful, that’s why we created Friendz.

Friendz is a digital marketing company whose main goal 
is to connect brands to their target audience, taking 
advantage of the most powerful marketing tool ever, 
“word of mouth”. Friendz is proud to have introduced 
a new way of doing digital advertising, based on 
communication among peers. 

Friendz is an already operating product that is providing 
services through the support of a community of over 
200,000 users, continuously engaged in the activities 
running in the app. The community is always ready and 
willing to participate in the campaigns organised by 
Friendz, in exchange for rewards. The reward is issued 
in order to motivate and appreciate the users for their 
participation in content creation and validation.

In 2016 Friendz received €500,000 worth of financing 
from Triboo Group, a public company and important 
player in the digital marketing industry, enabling it to hit 
the market and create its network. At the end of 2017 
revenues amounted to € 1,200,000.

Friendz is integrating its platform with blockchain, with the aim of decentralizing the digital advertising system. 
With the future developments of the platform, it will be possible to enhance trust towards users and client 
companies and to increase the products and services offered. In addition, our community will become larger 
and multinational.

Next steps for the future

VISION

Friendz aims to become the perfect tool to activate 
communities all over the world

Friendz wants to develop a global 
ecosystem where companies can 
freely and directly interact with an 
active community that creates and 
validates contents published on their 
social media profiles. Our service can 
be used by every kind of business in 
need of creative contents for social 
media.

Companies will have the possibility to engage directly 
with a highly interactive community of users that create 
contents and perform other marketing activities on 
demand, following the guidelines provided. In addition, 
thanks to the blockchain mechanism, all the contents 
created, will be checked by the community itself through 
a decentralized validation system that guarantees top 
quality results and secure transactions.

“Our service can be used 
by every kind of business”

We believe that the adoption of the 
blockchain technology can greatly 
improve our business model, making 
it possible for our app to achieve 
unprecedented results with a 
centralized system.

For the very first time, Friendz will 
enable companies to call users to 
action directly, asking them to create 
contents or perform other promotional 
activities depending on their needs 
at any particular point in time. After 
the results our model has achieved 
off-chain for the last two years, we 
now look forward to decentralising the 
Friendz platform in order to offer our 
services to B2B and B2C clients and 
to new clients coming from the crypto 
world.

It is through the use of a decentralized blockchain technology that the safe transfer 
of funds and the completion of services will be certified. Friendz platform will 
become even safer and more advanced technologically thereby protecting the 
interest of our community and clients worldwide.

We are planning to introduce a transparent system that will track the flow of 
marketing spending on Friendz platform, in a totally revolutional way to digital 
advertising. The use of Friendz Coins will in fact provide brands with the 
opportunity to spread their advertising messages and to reach the friends of 
Friendz users in a genuine and creative way. Users will be rewarded for being 
active and will use the reward to purchase other services from Friendz.

Our plan is to maintain a focus on digital advertising but with an open eye on new 
markets and opportunities. Friendz platform will be available to any company 
that requires services such as validation systems, quick content generation, 
bug testing, market research and app review. Our clients will not only be B2C 
companies, but also B2B, and those coming from the blockchain industry, all 
with the common goal of reaching the final users. The automation of all activities 
will ensure that Friendz’s role becomes that of merely guaranteeing community 
participation and engagement in the activities proposed.

We plan to use blockchain technology to provide an 
even safer and reliable experience to our clients and 

We plan to decentralize the digital advertising business, 
creating a traceable single tool that can be adopted globally to 
activate users and involve them in the creation of advertising 
campaigns

In the long term we want to provide every online 
activity-as-a-service, in and beyond the world of digital 
marketing. The idea is to develop a platform where 
companies can activate large communities of users to 
perform various activities that will enhance their brands

MARKETING 
SECTOR

- THIS IS FRIENDZ MARKETING

Total media ad spending is expected 
to rise to $724.1 billion in 2020, 
represented by digital ad spending 
for 46%. Strong demand for digital 
advertising, particularly mobile, will 
be the main driver for spending 
increase. The top five advertising 
markets worldwide; the US, China, 
Japan, UK and Germany - will 
continue to dominate in 2018 and 
the succeeding forecast years.

Display advertising, or banners, 
is without doubt the mostly used 
marketing channel. These are 
images containing advertising 
content positioned in several spots 
in the web pages. Given their 
traceability characteristic, these ads 
enable the companies to analyse the 
performance of their campaigns and 
to track their marketing spending.

According to eMarketer predictions, global ad 
spending is projected to rise faster than previously 
expected, growing by 8.8% in 2018 to $642.9 
billion. The growth is largely due to increased digital 
advertising activities.

Following the downturn of traditional 
advertising tools, companies 
oriented their marketing activities 
to Influencer marketing, a form of 
marketing based on the influence 
that famous people have on their 
network, sometimes made up of 
millions of followers. The objective of 
the companies is to reach targeted 
people that are interested in what 
the influencer they follow shows, 
rather than targeting the market as 
a whole.

More than one in three marketers said they expected their 
influencer marketing budgets to increase, and 84% expected to 
run at least one influencer campaign in 2016. (source: Nielsen)

“Influencer marketing is 
based on the assumption 
that people like more 
products used and proposed 
by people they know and 
trust”

Although influencer marketing 
seems to have become popular 
overnight, many brand-influencer 
advertising sponsorships started as 
early as 10 years ago. What started 
with popular bloggers and blog 
advertising has now spread into 
other influencer channels including 
Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube.

to Adweek, 500% more than other demographics 
combined. Conversely, 2015 marked the first time that 
time spent on mobile apps exceeded time spent on TV, 
by nearly 198 minutes. (source: Bloomberg)

The increase in digital ad spending was forecasted 
to overtake TV ad spending in 2016. (source: WSJ) 
Although some sources pointed to a later overtake, the 
US TV advertising market currently represents roughly 
$70 billion.  (source: PWC)

Ad-blocking in 2015 was projected to have cost 
advertisers $22 billion dollars. In 2016, that amount was 
forecasted to be $42 billion. (source: PageFair)

Friendz takes advantage of the long tail of the digital 
marketing sector, as well as the knowledge and 
understanding of the potential and the rapid growth 
of the segment. We analysed Nielsen’s studies about 
the effectiveness of the online word of mouth (WOM).

Friendz understands the power of 
WOM and applies it effectively on 
social media, we propose it as valid 
alternative to other existing digital 
marketing tools which are slowly 
becoming ineffective.

We are not influencers,
we are just Friendz.

The market analysis shows that the 
broader the number of followers, 
the lower the engagement rate 
between the influencer and his or 
her audience. Companies look for 
well-known influencers in order to 
reach as many people as possible, 
consequently creating a distant 
relationship between them and their 
audience.

Friendz users are not celebrities 
or famous influencers. They do 
not use their social media profiles 
for advertising, but for fun. Their 
network on social media goes from 
500 to 2,000 followers and usually 
the contents they post reach an 
heterogeneous audience composed 
mainly of friends, relatives and close 
connections. Every person who 
shares contents on social media 
transmits a message ready to be 
processed by his or her peers, who 
share the same interest and habits 
as them. Sharing ideas and contents 
in this way generates a high level of 
involvement both online and offline. 
It is thanks to this mechanism of 
involvement that our community 
is always active and ready to 
participate in our campaigns.

Friendz has revolutionised the way publishers relate with their audience. Our market-
ing communication system is not the typical top down (where brands target the market 
as a whole), but rather one based on communication among peers. The reference tar-
get of the contents posted by a Friendz is therefore a community of peers composed 
of people that either know or are acquainted to each other directly.

on the mobile and web app, by creating and posting 
contents based on specific guidelines. In exchange, they 
receive a reward that can be used to unlock in-app special

Friendz not only proposes Brand campaigns with 
advertising messages, but it engages users on a 
daily basis through the so called Fun campaigns. 
Fun campaigns are designed to keep a high level of 
engagement within our community while also providing 
our users with the opportunity of being rewarded as 
they have “fun” taking pictures. The contents of these 
campaigns are, in fact, created by our team with the 
aim of involving and entertaining our community. The 
greatest advantage of taking part in the fun campaigns 
is that it makes the social media profiles of users 
look more genuine and populated with creative and 
diversified contents. The participation in the Fun and 
Brand campaigns is regulated by a first-come first-served 
mechanism, since the number of users involved in the 
activity is limited. Following a meritocratic logic, users 
with excellent abilities of creating contents will receive 
the campaigns first, while other users with average 
photographic skills receive them later. 

      

The profile quality is determined by both the rating of 
the approvers in the approval process and the users’ 
who have access to a dedicated wall inside the app 
where everyone can see and rate the pictures. The 
rating system is based on a “1 to 5 stars” scale;

Through Friendz dashboard, clients

through specific KPIs. Our success is 
driven by the possibility of adapting 
the services provided by Friendz to 
achieve different goals. We know 
that every client is unique and has 
different needs and expectations. 
For this reason, we have designed 
specific solutions to meet those 
needs and expectations. Our

We have developed a systematic approach for 
checking every single content before it is published 
online.
Everyday, highly qualified users, that we call approvers, 
screen contents manually to check whether the users 
have complied with the rules set for the particular 
campaign they are participating in. If one or more of 
the rules have not been respected, then the content 
is rejected and the user invited to upload a new one 
on the app in order to take part in the campaign. If a 
sufficient number of approvers accepts it, the content 
is automatically published on the user’s personal social 
profile through Facebook or Instagram API.

The approval mechanism is essential for maintaining a 
high quality of service.
While evaluating contents, the approvers pay particular 
attention to the content quality, the copy of the caption, 
the compliance with the requirements, and also 
the accuracy of the hashtags that accompany each 
content. Approvers receive a reward in exchange for 
their participation, based on the number of contents 
approved.

Any user can become an approver and be rewarded 
for content validation, but only after having taken part 
in a sufficient number of campaigns, achieving a high 
profile quality and having passed an initial approval test.

Approval System
The approval process is automatically distributed .
The approvers can start their validation work on a 
dashboard which displays all the ongoing campaigns 
and the contents uploaded. To ensure a rapid approval 
process, the system works on a first-come first-served 
basis. Therefore the first approvers who correctly check 
and approve a particular content are rewarded.

Approvers are ranked on the basis of the accuracy 
of their approvals, to guarantee their alignment 
with Friendz guidelines. The higher the accuracy in 
classifying contents, the higher the ranking. A content 
is classified correctly when an approver’s choice is 
consistent with the choice of all the other approvers 
that checked that same content. After a high number of 
mistakes, the approver falls below a minimum threshold 
and is automatically disqualified and removed from the 
approval system.

BUSINESS
MODEL
- VALUE PROPOSITION
- OUR CLIENTS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS

21



The idea was derived from the synthesis of some upward 
trends populating internet and social networks:

Firstly, companies are faced with the problem of 
gaining the interest of the audience on social media and 
involving final users in brand communication campaigns. 
Users don’t identify with communication campaigns run 
by companies, since their perception of the contents 
is unnatural. Consequently, brands get poor results 
in terms of quality and engagement in their marketing 
strategies.

Secondly, people create and publish millions of 
contents on their social media profiles everyday, such as 
photos, audio, texts, videos, that often contain unwitting 
advertising messages. Through these activities people 
seek personal gratification from comments and 
interactions with their posts, but most of them don’t 
know how to boost their profiles and thus end up posting 
unappealing contents.

This can be resolved by leveraging on the trust people 
have with each other, especially those they know and 
whose advice they can listen to.

We highly encourage the creative attitude of the targeted 
users and do all we can to boost their persuasive power 
on social community. We ask our Friendz to produce 
and share funny and creative contents with powerful 
storytelling capable of describing the brand’s product. 
In addition, thanks to the gamification system, we can 
guarantee that the contents provided are top-quality.

Friendz is an innovative marketing platform that offers a new way 
of doing digital marketing, taking advantage of the potential that 
private profiles and the content distributed on social media have.

VALUE
PROPOSITION

Friendz guides individual creativity in the conception of 
user generated contents (UGCs) containing advertising 
messages which creates high engagement rate in brand 
communication projects.

Moreover, presenting the product or service in an 
environment where people trust each other and share 
the same set of values, empowers the communication 
messages of the companies, making it more effective 
than the usual impersonal advertising campaigns.

Friendz contents
spontaneously and creatively 
catch the audience attention.

Using the lean approach, we started 
testing our product in order to 
validate the business proposition 
and the market interest. Now that the 
business model has been validated, 
we believe that blockchain is the 
right platform on which we can 
further develop and strengthen our 
model to its full potential.

All the operations that are currently 
done manually will be done 
automatically with the support of 
blockchain technology. Thanks to 
the numerous milestones, Friendz 
will soon be able to apply this system, 
hence becoming the market leader 
in the provision of peer-to-peer 
marketing services.

The advertising spending will 
be registered on the blockchain 
in complete transparency. The 
decentralization of the platform will 
make the check of contents even 
more more safe for brands.

Clients can automatically activate 
thousands of people that will cre-
ate contents and perform actions 
following the rules provided in the 
campaign (for example publishing a 
picture, a video or creating a special 
advertising content)

We can provide a service of con-
tent validation where the platform 
automatically shows contents to 
experience users as soon as they 
are uploaded. These are real peo-
ple that check contents manually 
following specific rules.

Having a dedicated coin makes the 
brand identifiable. Everyone will 
know that Friendz Coins is the tool 
used to activate communities in the 
digital marketing world.

In the future, brands will be able to 
perform marketing campaigns all 
over the world with a single tool. 
They will no longer need to interact 
with many marketing agencies to 
activate communities, but could rely 
on Friendz to get these services.

Friendz will be able to increase its 
offer to several businesses, also 
the newcomers from the blockchain 
industry.

The use of Friendz Coins will enrich 
user experience in the app: the 
community will be able to unlock 
new features and services in the app 
using the coins. The new features 
will be designed to increase the 
degree of online user interaction. 

Some of these items will be games, 
others will increase the interaction 
among the users, some of them will 
boost the user profile and some 
others will influence their social 
activity.

We will start to run an international user acquisition strategy with the 
purpose of creating multiple local communities that will be part of the 
big Friendz family. The expansion of Friendz abroad will make more 
and more people using the platform.

In the long term, we want to expand the business to other sectors 
beyond digital advertising, extending our offer of products and 
services in order to meet the needs of B2B companies and of 
those coming from the crypto world. We will involve users not only 
in advertising campaigns, but also in different kinds of activities 
commissioned by clients.

Thanks to the ICO, we will be able to develop a technological system 
that will enhance the capacity of our business.

Going abroad means winning new clients and providing local 
services to our existing clients. Clients will have the possibility to 
target their campaigns internationally using a single tool without the 
need of asking for marketing services to different agencies anymore.

Friendz purpose is to decentralize the advertising process and 
the system of content creation and validation on social media. 

The ICO process has several advantages for our business:

WHY AN
ICO?

Increase our offer

Broad international 
community

Technological system

Expand our business 
worldwide

The funds raised during the ICO process will be used to expand our 
business worldwide and to consolidate our presence in the countries 
where we already operate. We will open new offices starting from 
European countries and then expanding to other areas with great 
potential for digital advertising around the world.

When brands want to access Friendz marketing services, 
Friendz provides them with an amount of Friendz 
credits. Credits are a useful tool for the clients to define 
a campaign size and level of participation. 

The number of Credits provided is related to the 
campaign size, that depends on the the budget allocated 
by the client. Credits will be used to reward users and 
approvers.

Users accumulate credits while having fun taking 
pictures, creating contents and participating to the 
activities and campaigns proposed in the app. Approvers 
accumulated credits while checking the contents 
uploaded in the app. 

They are part of Friendz gamification system and let 
users keep track of how much their are active in the app.

Users and approvers can use their credits to get gift 
cards, vouchers and coupons of various online stores. 
We provide those coupons in the special section of our 
app, for example Amazon, Ebay, Zara, Gamestop and 
many more.

After reaching a determined threshold, users can 
transform their credits into Friendz tokens and use them 
inside Friendz platform or transfer them into personal 
wallets.

Credits are a scoring system that tracks users’ degree of 
participation in the campaigns.

Brands buy Friendz advertising 
campaigns using either fiat money 
or Friendz Coins. Friendz stores 
the Friendz Coins received in a 
designated internal wallet giving 
brands an equivalent amount of 
Credits in exchange. 

The Friendz Coins will be given to the 
community to access features inside 
the app transforming their Credits. 
Friendz will consider to repurchase 
some tokens from existing holders in 
case the ones stored in the reserve 
will not be sufficient to cover the 
community needs.

The number of Credits will be determined by the campaign size and will be 
used to reward users and approvers.

app. The community can use their 
credits to get discount coupons for 
products and services online.

In order to access special features 
that increase their engagement and 
boost their profiles in the app, users 
first have to transform a sufficient 
number of Credits into Friendz 
Coins. It is possible to do this in a 
special section inside the app. Users 
and approvers can always find their 
Friendz Coins inside their Coin 
Wallet.

Friendz coins can be taken out 
from the platform and deposited in 
personal external wallets.

Campaign setup: a group of 
skilled approvers validate the 
campaign’s creativity making 
sure that it is consistent with the 
community’s policy.

Content creation: users create 
advertising contents following the 
rules provided by the campaign.

Content validation: a group 
of skilled approvers validates 
the quality of contents created 
making sure that they respect the 
guidelines before the publication

Clients have the possibility to assign a concept and a 
brief and then to select specific parameters such as: the 
budget; the size (number of users involved); the target 
users (the people they want to interact with); the social 
network (Facebook, Instagram or Twitter); the creativity 
(product or concept placement). Through Friendz 
dashboard, clients can monitor in real time the campaign 
progress and analyse the results with specific KPIs.

Once the service has been purchased, the platform 
computes the Credits necessary to complete the 
campaign.

The system creates three stacks of Credits that measure 
the number of participants and the reward:

Clients can buy Friendz marketing services from the platform 
and they can set up their campaign using a special Client 
Dashboard.

Once the processes of creativity and contents creation 
and validation are finished, the contents that have 
successfully passed the validation stage are published 
on the user’s private social profile. From this point on, 
the contents are visible to the audience of all user’s 
peers and online connections.

This great exposure will make the campaign reach their

Users can take part in the campaigns both from Android 
and iOs devices and also from the desktop version. They 
can choose the campaign they want to join, and have 
to read the rules provided before posting any content. 
The users are then given time to create the content and 
upload it in the app. If the content successfully passes the 
validation process, it is automatically posted on user’s social 
media profile, Facebook or Instagram, depending on the 
campaign chosen, through the respective API. If, instead, it 
is rejected, the user is invited to create and upload a new 
content.

After the publication, users receive a commensurate 
amount of Credits as established in the campaign rules. 
Credits are collected in the user’s Credits wallet inside 
Friendz platform. After collecting a sufficient amount of 
Credits, users can decide to use them to get coupons 
and vouchers for online stores or to convert them into 
Friendz Coins in a specific section within the app. It will 
be possible for the users to see two different wallets in 
the app, one containing Credits and the other containing 
Friendz Coins. 

The users

There is a minimum threshold set for how many Credits 
a user has to collect in order to be able to transform 
them into Friendz coins. 

Friendz Coins can be spent to buy special and premium 
features inside the app. Alternatively, users can withdraw 
Friendz Coins from the app and store them in a personal 
external wallet. A more detailed description of the 
Friendz Coins utility is presented in a specific paragraph 
dedicated just for that.

The approvers
Friendz will provide top quality services thanks to the 
collaboration of two groups of approvers that will be 
rewarded for their activity of creativity and contents 
validation.

Creativity approvers

There are highly skilled users with professional 
backgrounds that will validate the campaign setup 
by the client. Their duty will be to check that the 
client has provided all the information needed to 
design the campaign.

In addition, creativity approvers will check that the 
new campaigns are in line with Friendz terms and 
conditions and that they respect the company’s 
policies in terms of numbers, difficulty, appeal, 
legality and decorum. The approvers will not 
be responsible for the results delivered by the 
campaign after it has been approved.

The content approval process is distributed and 
automatic. Content approvers have access to a special 
dashboard where they have an overview of all the 
campaigns and contents uploaded. The system works on 
a first-come- first-served basis, indeed the first approvers 
who correctly check a content will be rewarded.

Creativity and Contents approvers will be ranked on the 
base of the accuracy of their work. We added a ranking 
system to guarantee approvers’ alignment with Friendz 
guidelines and to hasten the speed of their operations. The 
higher the accuracy in classifying contents, the higher the 

Contents approvers

There are highly skilled users that have previously 
taken part in several other campaigns, and have 
obtained high quality scores. Their task will be 
to check every single content uploaded in the 
app, making sure that it complies with Friendz 
rules, the campaign guidelines and brand 
safety requirements. The screening process will 
specifically examine the quality of the content, the 
caption that accompanies it and the presence of 
campaign hashtags.

ranking. A content is correctly classified when it receives 
the approval of a sufficient number of approvers. If an 
approver repeatedly makes mistakes in judging contents, 
he will be automatically disqualified and removed from the 
approval system.

Users and approvers can spend Friendz Coins to access 
in-app special and premium features. Alternatively, they 
can transfer Friendz Coins from the app, storing them in a 
personal external wallet. A more detailed description of the 
Friendz Coins utility is presented in a specific paragraph 
dedicated just for that.

Friendz offers a variety of digital advertising services, 
some of which are brand awareness campaigns, 
product placement campaigns, sharing contents, market 
researches and lead generation activities. Our core 
business is to design advertising campaigns with the aim 
of involving as many people as possible in our activities. 

If brands purchase Friendz services in fiat money, Friendz 
will consider to use part of it to repurchase Friendz Coins 
from existing holders and give them to the community 
when they need to transform their credits.

 

The Friendz Coins Wallet collects all the coins that will 
be assigned to users and approvers whenever they will 
decide to convert their Credits. Users can send tokens 
to other wallets. In order to transfer the tokens, users 
will be provided with the tool to register its destination 
wallet within the app.

Friendz works as a real social network. Users can have access to special 
in-app features that will improve their online experience, increasing 
the degree of amusement through the gamification process. Inside this 
mechanism users are allowed to increase their visibility and exposure 
within the app, create more interaction with other users and boost their 
profiles. The smart contract will provide a maximum boost per day for 
the users, over and above which requests will be rejected.

 Users will be able to use the tokens to participate in gamified contests 
organized by Friendz. The game rules will be set in the chain, so that 
it will be possible to leverage on the power of full transparency of the 
network in order to create a totally fair system.

Examples of possible features are:

Clients will receive a special discount on the final price of products

The first phase of integration is already available in our 
demo: it is the implementation of a virtual wallet inside the 
app where one can not only transform Credits into Friendz 
Coins but also send tokens to external addresses.

In addition, users who desire to send out tokens, will have 
the opportunity to register the desired destination wallet 
within the app.

For the time being, blockchain is not able to support 
numerous and frequent transactions, but if there will be 
a blockchain be able to process a greater throughput 
of operations per seconds, it could be an interesting 
implementation to substitute Credits with tokens, thus fully 
basing Friendz platform on the blockchain.

Friendz retains the right to exchange or convert one to one 
Friendz tokens for equivalent value on the same blockchain 
or different blockchains.

We plan to fully integrate Friendz with the blockchain, by 
putting all our efforts in the development of the token, since 
we believe it is an important asset that will help unlock 
advanced features in the App.

Users will be able to unlock 
premium functions by spending 
their tokens on specific smart

a fixed amount of time. After the 
deadline, tokens will be returned 
to their owners. Through a special 
explorer, the system will detect the

As our community grows, we will create targeted 
clusters of users. We believe our community will grow 
structurally, based on our expansion objectives. As the 
community expands, more and more people will enjoy 
using the app and feeling involved.

In order to provide users with tokens when they want to 
transform their Credits, we can allocate between 15% and 
30% of revenues for repurchasing tokens from existing 
holders, and then provide them to the community.

Users and approvers can decide to use their tokens to access

While analysing a portion of the 
projects funded in the past, we 
noticed that the majority of them 
were new business ideas or rather 
startups whose main objective was to 
collect enough money through ICO 
to develop the prototype or the alpha 
version of their service and to hire 
members of the future team. These 
projects can be referred to as “seed 
projects”, characterized by a high 
degree of risk and probability to fail.

We believe it is in the interest of users 
and client companies to look for real 
companies and projects, sustained 
by sound business proposals, a super 
skilled team and a compelling vision.

create top-quality services for our 
clients and to involve and engage 
the community, online and offline on 
a daily basis.

Our business does not need further 
validation since it has been validated 
over the last two years and hence the 
project risk is reduced considerably.

he ICO will help Friendz in its global 
expansion and community growth 
plan, inviting a progressively higher 
number of people and companies 
interested in the world of cryptocur-
rencies to download and use our app 
and to try our services.

Friendz has a remarkable competitive 
advantage compared to other ICOs 
in the market. Friendz has been in 
operation for two years now, and 
has acquired well over 200 clients 
(the main ones are big brands and 
multinational enterprises) that bought 
advertising campaigns worth a total 
of over € 1,000,000 in revenues 
within that period. Our community 
is composed of more than 200,000

Users’ activity won’t be limited to participation in digital 
advertising campaigns only, but will be extended to 
every kind of online activity. This is why in this part of the 
paper we will be focusing on Activities.
The model described above is absolutely valid and 
adaptable to other market segments in the process of 
business expansion.

From the user’s side, Friendz platform won’t be 
subjected to particular changes: users will still receive 
an invitation to join the Activities and, if they follow the 
rules and complete the task required by the companies, 
they will be rewarded. Users will be asked to take part 
in different activities such as: taking a picture, recording 
a video, answering questions, participating in surveys, 
sharing links, translating articles. 

The Activity Approvers will validate the Activity setup, 
making sure it is in line with the client’s requirements. 
They will check that all the details needed to realize 
the Activity have been provided, so that any misunder-
standings are avoided. In addition, they will check that 

the activity respects Friendz terms and conditions and 
the community policy in terms of size, difficulty, legality 
and decorum. The Approvers will be rewarded for their 
activity and won’t be held responsible for the results 
delivered by the Activity after it has been approved. 

Contents Approvers will validate the provided contents 
following the same method used for the campaigns, 
without any alteration. We will maintain the adoption 
of the ranking system in order to always guarantee 
top-quality services.

Friendz core business will become the creation and 
validation of contents processed by a huge and 
multinational community.

In the long term, we want to provide every online-activity-as-a-service, 
developing a platform where companies looking for mass interactivity 
on social media can find large communities to involve in their marketing 
activities.

Friendz will offer content creation and validation services based on a 
decentralized system which can easily be adapted to businesses of 
different nature.

Examples of possible use of the service are

Clients will have the possibility to set up an activity entirely from the 
beginning to the end, and provide the guidelines for its realisation. In 
addition to the options already listed in the model for digital advertising 
campaigns, while creating the new activities they can also:

 We will offer our services not only to B2C brands in their attempt to 
reach final users, but also to B2B companies which will adopt Friendz 
platform for internal operations or for outsourcing services on the be-

Currently, Friendz is active in Italy and Spain. We intend 
to expand our business in other countries around the 
world, starting from the most relevant markets in the 
European Union and extending to all the European 
countries outside the European Union that are investing 
actively in the Digital Marketing, by the end of 2020.

In the long term, our efforts will be focused on the 
creation of a business suitable for the delivery of the new 
services we intend to provide. We will not only offer digital 
advertising services, but a number of other products that 
will involve a huge multinational community. 

In order to do this, we need to achieve key technical 
and strategic improvements, including the acquisition 
of assets and licences, mergers, acquisitions and other 
extraordinary finance operations with other companies 
necessary to the international development.

The funds collected in the ICO process will be used 
for three main purposes:

To expand our business abroad

Making companies fall in love 
with Friendz and telling the 
world that we are great! 

Our Team is definitely our most 
valuable asset: it is extremely 
important for us, that every new 
member of the team is passionate 
about what he is doing, wants 
to be disruptive in his initiatives 
and is conscious that his work is 
unique and fundamental. We hired 
the first team members taking into 
consideration their personality 
and motivation rather than specific 
technical competences. 
More importantly we have never 

shied away from welcoming people 
without any work experience in 
our company. On the contrary, we 
believe that the attitude, energy and 
determination typical of a newcomer, 
could provide that added value we 
are always looking for to make our 
projects special. Over time we have 
also teamed up with technicians and 
competent advisors who have made 
a great contribution in developing 
and continually improving our 
services.

FRIENDZ COIN 
LEGAL AND 
CROWDSALE

59



FRIENDZ COIN LEGAL 
AND CROWDSALE

The Friendz Coin does not have the legal 
qualification of a security, since it does not 
give any rights to dividends or interests. FDZ 
Token does not have the legal qualification 
as a payment token, since it is not intended 
to be used as a means of payment to acquire 
goods or services by third parties, or a means 
of money or value transfer. The sale of FDZs is 
final and non-refundable. FDZs are not shares 
and do not give any right to participate to the 
general meeting of FRIENDZ. FDZ cannot have 
a performance or a particular value outside 
the FRIENDZ SA network. FDZ shall therefore 

not be used or purchased for speculative or 
investment purposes. The purchaser of FDZ 
is aware that national securities laws, which 
ensure that investors are sold investments 
that include all the proper disclosures and are 
subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors’ 
protection, are not applicable.
Anyone purchasing FDZ expressly 
acknowledges and represents that she/he 
has carefully reviewed this white paper and 
fully understands the risks, costs and benefits 
associated with the purchase of FDZ.

Knowledge Required 

The purchaser of FDZ undertakes that she/he understands and has significant experience of 
cryptocurrencies, blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks 
associated with the crowdsale as well as the mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies 
(incl. storage).
FRIENDZ SA shall not be responsible for any loss of FDZ or situations making it impossible 
to access FDZs, which may result from any actions or omissions of the user or any person 
undertaking to acquire FDZs, as well as in case of hacker attacks.

Risks

Acquiring FDZ and storing them involves various risks, in particular the risk that FRIENDZ 
may not be able to further develop its operations and develop its blockchain and provide the 
services promised. Therefore, and prior to acquiring FDZs, any user should carefully consider 
the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring FDZ in the context of the crowdsale and, if necessary, 
obtain any independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position 
to accept or to understand the risks associated with the activity or any other risks as indicated 
in the Terms & Conditions of the crowdsale should not acquire FDZs.

Important disclaimer

This white paper shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into an 
investment. It does not constitute or relate in any way nor should be considered as an offering 
of securities in any jurisdiction. The white paper does not include nor contain any information 
or indication that might be considered as a recommendation or that might be use to base any 
investment decision. This document does not constitute an offer or an invitation to sell shares, 
securities or rights belonging to FRIENDZ or any related or associated company. The FDZ is 
just a utility token which can be used only on the FRIENDZ platform and is not intended to be 
used as an investment.
The offering of FDZ on a trading platform is done in order to allow the use of the FRIENDZ 
platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of FDZ on a trading platform is not 
changing the legal qualification of the token, which remains a simple means for the use of the 
FRIENDZ platform and is not a security.
FRIENDZ is not to be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial matters. Any 
information in the white paper is given for general information purpose only and FRIENDZ does 
not provide with any warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of this information. Given 
the lack of crypto-token qualifications in most countries, each buyer is strongly advised to carry 
out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of FRIENDZ’s according to 
their nationality and place of residence.
FRIENDZ today is not a financial intermediary according to Swiss Law and is not required to 
obtain any authorization for Anti-Money Laundering purpose. This qualification may change 
in case FRIENDZ will offers services which are to be considered as qualifying a financial 
intermediation activity. In this case, the use of FRIENDZ services may require the positive 
conclusion of an AML/KYC identification process. 
FDZs confer no direct or indirect right to FRIENDZ’s capital or income, nor does it confer any 
governance right within FRIENDZ; an FDZ is not proof of ownership or a right of control over 
FRIENDZ and does not grant the controlling individual any asset or share in FRIENDZ, or in the 
FRIENDZ network. An FDZ does not grant any right to participate in control over FRIENDZ’s 
management or decision-making set-up, or over the FRIENDZ network and governance to the 
Purchasers.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to cryp-
tocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may 
impact FRIENDZ’s business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the 
future. Any person undertaking to acquire FDZ must be aware of the FRIENDZ business model, 
the white paper or terms and conditions may change or need to be modified because of new 
regulatory and compliance requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such 
a case, purchasers and anyone undertaking to acquire FDZ acknowledge and understand that 
neither FRIENDZ nor any of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or 
damage caused by such changes.
FRIENDZ will do its utmost to launch its operations and develop the FRIENDZ platform. Anyone 
undertaking to acquire FDZ acknowledges and understands that FRIENDZ will launch its first 
services by the start of the Crowdsale. Other services available to the FDZ Token purchasers 

may be offered at a later stage, according to the Whitepaper. On concluding the Commercial 
Operation, these tokens will be issued by a technical process referred to as a «Blockchain». 

61



This is an open source IT protocol over which the Company has no rights or liability in terms of 
its development and operation. The token distribution mechanism will be controlled by a Smart 
Contract; this involves a computer program that can be executed on the Ethereum network or 
on a blockchain network that is compatible with Smart Contract programming language. They 
acknowledge and understand therefore that FRIENDZ (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes 
no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the 
incapacity to use FDZ s, except in case of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
FDZ s is based on the Ethereum protocol. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or 
unexpected operation of the Ethereum protocol may cause the FRIENDZ network or FRIENDZs 
to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected. Ether, the native Ethereum Protocol 
account unit may itself lose value in a similar way to FDZs, and also in other ways.
