“A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity”  

– Dalai Lama 

The same can be said for any industry, but where wealth plays such a crucial factor in 

our daily lives, should we be subjected to such “distrust” and “insecurity” in the most 

influential sector of all, the finance industry.  

This white paper aims to address such inefficiencies by introducing a solution 

combining smart contracts on the blockchain to drastically transform the way in which 

we Lend, Send and Spend.

Executive Summary 
Etherecash is a blockchain based decentralized platform, designed to revolutionise three core 

functions of finance; to Lend, Send and Spend. By bringing such key services on the blockchain we 

can provide more transparency and greatly enhance customer experience. Our mission is to “bridge 

the gap between those with access to finance and those without, eliminating borders, 

intermediaries and prejudices.” 

Blockchain technology is making its way into all industries, but its characteristics makes it most 

suitable for the financial services sector. The introduction of blockchain technology could bring a 

new-found trust to the sector, while establishing a greater sense of security and reliability. 

Particularly since the financial crisis of 2008, the distrust and uncertainty in the industry has 

severely eroded consumer confidence. The availability of credit in the market for individuals and 

SME’s brutally diminished. This made way for innovative peer to peer lending and borrowing 

options which could be accessed online. These internet and mobile based solutions could offer 

more competitive terms, greater access and faster approvals. [14] The Lending Club, being the 

largest P2P platform serviced over $55 billion new loans during 2017, compared to 2016 that means 

a 40% growth in loan value. Just to emphasize the extent of this growth, Morgan Stanley predicts 

that P2P lending globally could reach $490 billion by 2020. [15] 

Peer to peer lending presents an opportunity to reach a wider audience of borrowers and lenders, 

from different economic backgrounds with different financial needs. By increasing the pool of 

investors, P2P lending can give access to a more competitive marketplace. The real challenge is 

how to send and receive the funds in a secure manner and avoid the exorbitant charges from third 

party intermediaries. Using Etherecash, a crypto token on the blockchain, developed on the 

ethereum platform, you can lend, send and spend in a quick, pocket friendly and hassle-free 

manner. Payment transfers can be made worldwide near instantaneously, with minimal fees. The 

process is simple, the system is global and it’s accessible 24/7. It works on a decentralized platform 

where each transaction is recorded in a distributed ledger which is transparent, irreversible and 

cannot be manipulated as it is not stored on a single system, but instead on millions of devices. 

Through the Etherecash platform we can provide loans which are border free, prejudice free, hassle 

free. 

Our speedy money transfer system addresses the needs of consumers, as transactions can be 

processed quicker and at a fraction of the cost compared with traditional payment systems. Due 

to the digital nature of cryptocurrencies like Etherecash, transactions are private and secured with

encrypted codes. This protects the user, and addresses the concerns of data protection. Etherecash 

helps you to overcome the lengthy, complex procedures of traditional banks through our user-

friendly interface, needing just a mobile and internet access. 

Then we decided to take this concept one step further, by looking at the spend ability of your 

Etherecash. Cryptocurrencies have been known to be inherently difficult to spend in our daily lives, 

with the need for an exchange to convert to local currency. Not anymore, as we design the 

Etherecash multi crypto debit card, facilitating the storage and spending of your cryptos in stores 

and online. You can even make ATM withdrawals in local currencies. Now you can carry all your 

assets in your pockets enabling you to lend, send or spend in a simple and secure manner. 

Built on the ethereum platform, Etherecash utilizes smart contracts to facilitate complex 

transactions in accordance with the terms of the contract. The transactions are recorded on the 

ethereum blockchain in a decentralized public ledger which is tamper proof and irreversible. The 

transactions are fast, efficient, transparent and in accordance with KYC and AML norms for 

regulatory compliance. Etherecash offers a platform where customers use the Etherecash token as 

a utility for paying services fees for every completed transaction on the platform – borrowing, 

lending, sending and spending. 

The Etherecash concept aims to address the primary pain points in the financial services sector 

through the adoption of blockchain and smart contracts to bring transparency and clarity to the 

industry. By bringing people to a unique platform to connect directly, without third parties, and 

have access to funding and opportunities that otherwise would not exist in their local marketplace.

Introduction 
Etherecash aims to establish itself as a secure and reliable decentralized platform for the core 

financial services. By moving these key services to the blockchain and with the introduction of 

smart contracts, we intend to provide a more future proof, pocket friendly medium to meet 

consumers needs on a global scale. This white paper explores the current scenario with regards to 

the finance and lending sector, and how inefficiencies and lack of transparency is causing the need 

for alternative measures, such as Etherecash. 

Technology has and always will be the driving force disrupting industries, from process 

improvement, research and development, big data, medical robots and most recently blockchain 

technology. Since the creation of internet, individuals, business and institutions have constantly 

evolved themselves, their theories and their contributions to society. Nothing has changed, but 

somehow everything has changed. Through the ability to connect with resources and minds from 

different countries, economies and ecosystems, we have learned the need for change. Through 

the sharing of information, we have established the benefits of transparency. However, somewhere 

in the development of our financial framework we lost sight of this. Today, there is a clear shift 

and rising demand from consumers for transparency, efficiency and affordability, not just in the 

finance and lending sector but across the board.  Particularly when many consumers no longer ‘fit 

in a box’. They do not meet the standard terms or criteria which enable financial institutes to 

categorise them and although they may have the financial capability to repay a loan, they are not 

even considered because banks don’t understand them. Entrepreneurs are a perfect example of 

this. 

Historically, goods were traded through a barter system, which then evolved into silver and gold, 

and soon after came currency or ‘cash’. The common thread here is value. Things of value can be 

traded and will always be in demand. Those with value have the upper hand, and those in need 

must accept the deal they’re offered. Unfortunately, the gap between those with access to finance 

and those without, has grown exponentially. This has further strengthened the positions of lending 

institutions and made it more difficult, expensive and lengthy for individuals and often SME’s to 

obtain loans. Below is a summary of Euro area SME’s that described ‘Access to Finance’ as the 

most pressing problem they faced back in 2014. [17]

This is one of the main challenges witnessed in the financial industry due to the high costs of 

expanding operations, resulting in economic exclusion. With the loan market increasing day by day 

and the fact that everybody wants to be an entrepreneur, the lines of credit open to us need to be 

flexible and reachable. So, let’s go back to our roots of getting connected and being transparent. 

The market for peer to peer payments and remittances globally is worth over $1 trillion. [17] Our 

aim is to bring borrowers and lenders on a single platform where those with access to finance can 

connect with those in need of finance, and reach mutually beneficial terms that suit both their 

needs. Through Etherecash, loans can be achieved using a smart contract which is lawyer backed 

and secured using cryptocurrency. The smart contract is executed on the ethereum platform 

facilitating a complex transaction which is peer to peer, and the transaction details are recorded 

on the ethereum blockchain. This enables individuals or companies who have cryptos to borrow 

against them, to generate immediate cashflow, without liquidating their cryptos. Borrowers can 

use their cryptocurrencies as collateral, in a safe and secure environment. Similarly, lenders who 

have unutilised funds, can provide loans as per their comfort level and still achieve higher returns 

than typical bank deposits. By creating a win win situation, on a decentralized and fair platform, 

we are creating opportunities which otherwise would not exist. We are significantly improving the 

access to finance by enabling border free loans which are readily available and backed by lawyers. 

Now that’s just the start. 

Etherecash aims to deliver a complete ecosystem, by providing a speedy money transfer system 

and multi crypto debit card. Through our ecosystem we aim to service all aspects of our customers’ 

needs as ‘one brick does not build a house.’ Again, we are going back to the roots of connecting 

people in a transparent medium to send and receive funds from all corners of the globe, with

instant transactions, no intermediaries and at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking 

institutions. Now let’s take it a step further by enabling you to store and spend your funds or 

cryptos on our Etherecash debit card. It can be used for payments in E-commerce, traveling abroad 

or just buying your groceries. It works just like a normal debit card and can be used to withdraw 

local currency from ATM machines also, giving you 24/7 access to funds. Carry all your assets in 

your pocket and manage them your way.  

 

Target  
Our aim is to to ‘bridge the gap’ between those with access to finance and those without, 

eliminating borders, intermediaries and prejudices. 

Through the creation of the Etherecash platform, we hope to enable those with a phone and 

internet access to reach new mediums of finance, improve their access to loans, fast and affordable 

money transfer, along with a multi-use crypto debit card system. Why should finance be difficult 

and hard to reach? The simple answer…It shouldn’t! 

Who do we intend to service?  Everybody, but just to help you understand please find below some 

everyday examples: 

• Individuals 

• SME’s 

• Companies 

• Students 

• Projects 

For years, credit and favourable loan terms were a luxury for only those who had a good credit 

history or guarantor behind them. By reducing the rigidity of these terms, we can capture a new 

market of lenders and borrowers from individuals, SME’s, companies, students and projects. The 

need for credit is not changing but our ability to satisfy these needs in a platform that is 

transparent, is notably a first. By bringing a platform of this type we can ensure that those with 

internet and a phone can connect and service each other’s financial needs in a secured environment 

with the legal guidance they require. Through the Etherecash platform we can service small loans 

for car repairs, medium loans for college fees and sizeable loans for projects and companies. The 

platform will service a diverse range of needs with customisable terms that meet the needs of both 

parties involved. The facility to repay such loans, and transfer money internationally will be quick  

 

 



 
 

10 | P a g e  
 

 

and with minimal costs. The receiver of funds will have the option to receive in their wallet or on 

their crypto debit card. All of these services will be paid for with the utility token. 

What do we hope to achieve? 

• Border free loans which are accessible to all. 

• Remove the limitation on the size of loan amounts. 

• Ensure customisable and mutual terms which are lawyer backed. 

• Eliminate the social prejudices associated with credit. 

• Enable fast and secure payments to be made locally and internationally. 

• Improve the spending ability of cryptos in our daily lives. 

“To bridge the gap between those with access to finance and those without, 
eliminating borders, intermediaries and prejudices.” 

 

By developing a platform which is accessible globally, we ensure a border free loan market. This 

vastly increases the number and type of lending options available to people. This creates healthy 

competition in an otherwise closed knit industry. From this we can expect to see more competitive 

loan terms and flexible loan amounts. In emerging markets where loans are virtually non-existent 

or totally one sided, Etherecash provides a vast scope for borrowers. By eliminating the social 

prejudice in this industry, we can service people fairly and more efficiently. 

For some, the process of making payments is so cumbersome and costly, that they resort to more 

ambiguous methods of payment which are both risky and unnecessary. Thus, by implementing a 

money transfer system that can be easily operated from your mobile phone, we can reduce the 

complexities, costs and timeframes when compared with traditional methods of transfer. Now, 

paying for goods and services whether locally or globally, the process can be simple, quick and no 

risk of charge backs. Thus, merchants with high transaction ratios would benefit hugely, reducing 

their cost per customer and ensuring instant transaction confirmations.  

Now let’s consider how to reduce fees even further, by bypassing the transaction fee associated 

with withdrawing your cryptos to your bank account. The Etherecash crypto debit would facilitate 

spending and payments for goods and services both online and instore, directly from your wallet. 

This means you don’t have to liquidate your cryptos ‘now’ to be able to spend them in the ‘future’.  

 



 
 

11 | P a g e  
 

 

Peer to Peer Lending Business Model  
Peer to peer lending platforms enable borrowers and lenders to connect in an online marketplace, 

directly, eliminating the role of an intermediary. The loan application process is generally straight 

forward facilitating faster decisions and higher ratio of approvals. The loan status and terms are 

clear and transparent establishing confidence in the parties involved. Lenders can theoretically 

shop for their ideal borrower, with the most attractive loan terms. Lenders also have the option to 

fund all or part of a loan, so they can diversify their loans and spread their risk across a range of 

borrowers. The interest rates offered to borrowers tend to be more competitive due to the credit 

availability, and similarly lenders can benefit from more attractive returns that typical bank 

deposits, thus satisfying both parties involved. The platform facilitators earn fees for providing this 

direct connection between borrowers and lenders, and a fair and transparent network in which 

they can service one another. 

 

Market Overview  
It’s no secret that the financial sector has suffered extensively since the global financial crisis of 

2008, but what came from that, was the realisation that banking procedures were lethargic, rigid 

and lengthy. With innovation and advancements in payment technology, the marketplace soon 

shifted towards a new wave of alternative lending known as P2P. As banks suffered heavy losses, 

loan disbursement became very strict. This gave rise to peer to peer lending which flourished due 

to quick and simplified procedures, faster approvals, better interest rates and increased 

transparency. [1] To better comprehend the effect of this, the opportunity of the global peer to 

peer market will be worth $897.85 billion by 2024 compared with $26.16 billion in 2015, according 

to a research report published by Transparency Market Research [2].

Firstly, let’s compare the traditional bank lending model versus alternative marketplace lending. 

FEATURES BANK LENDING MARKETPLACE LENDING 

Intermediary Bank acts as an intermediary. 

They pay interest on deposits, 

and earn interest on the 

lending of those deposited 

funds. 

Borrowers and lenders are connected 

directly usually on an online platform. 

Interest 

Earned 

Bank earns interest on the 

funds they lend. 

Fees are earned from the lender or 

borrower for availing of the service 

offered through the platform. 

Risk Banks take on the risk and 

must keep a capital reserve to 

cover potential losses. 

The lending is directly between the lender 

and borrower so no interest in earned by 

the marketplace lender or platform and no 

capital reserve is required. 

Transparency Transparency is limited and 

depositors have poor visibility 

in relation to how their funds 

are used. 

Transparency is emphasized as lenders 

can see the funds being lent and 

repayments being made. 

Liquidity 

Buffer 

This is required to bridge the 

gap between deposit maturity 

and loan repayment. 

No such buffer is required. 

 

A recent YouGov survey carried out in 2016 by Deloitte revealed how marketplace lenders have 

distinguished themselves by offering attractive lending rates and an enhanced customer 

experience. [3] From this it is clear, that certainty, accessibility and cultural capabilities are key 

factors which benefit greatly from marketplace lending.

FinTech Market Impacts 
Regulation, innovation and service standards must constantly evolve to keep up with consumer 

demands. For this reason, FinTech has emerged as the single biggest disruption in the finance 

sector due to its ability to meet and often exceed such demands. FinTech can be defined as 

“innovative solutions implemented to enhance the processes, products, business models and 

applications in the financial services industry”. Technology, and more specifically blockchain 

technology, is causing a positive disruption in the financial sector by transforming the fundamentals 

of how we bank.  

Peer to peer payments are a direct result of this, eliminating the challenges associated with hard 

currency such a printing, storage and logistics. The transformation witnessed in monetary systems 

is commonly described as ‘financial freedom’ or ‘democratised banking’. Such statements are 

capturing the attention of consumers and further contributing to the growth in peer to peer 

payments.  

As consumers embrace the technology and applications being introduced in this sector, transaction 

volumes are increasing, and so is consumer appreciation. Particularly in emerging markets with 

poor access and infrastructure, the adoption of peer to peer payment systems which can be 

operated using a mobile phone, is enabling unbanked consumers to enter the system for the first 

time.

The Problem  
The single biggest challenge in the financial sector today, is the lack of trust. With banks being 

extra stringent in their lending procedures, the time, costs and hassles of obtaining a loan are 

forcing consumers to marketplace lending. Evolution is a natural progression in ‘survival of the 

fittest’. For banking institutions to remain competitive, the demands and needs of consumers must 

be met, through the adoption of technology and applications that benefit the sector.  

The complexities of traditional banking services have become a burden, with the primary factors 

being: 

• High costs 

• Complex procedures 

• Lengthy approvals process 

• Access to information 

As economic policies are governed by central institutions such as governments and banks, this 

results in various inflation rates for the same asset class, globally. This is the driving factor for the 

consumer shift towards peer to peer lending, and a more competitive marketplace. 

The rise of cryptocurrencies in the market is also presenting a problem for finance and regulatory 

bodies, as they struggle to conceive solutions to monetize blockchain based assets, without 

liquidating them. As a result, such asset holders are being excluded from traditional borrowing and 

lending markets. 

 

The Pain Points  
According to a study carried out by PWC in 2014, 45% of economic crime took place in financial 

service organisations, in comparison to just 37% across all other industries. [8] Among these the 

top five key threats were as follows: 

• Asset misappropriation 67% 

• Cybercrime 39% 

• Money Laundering 24% 

• Accounting Fraud 21% 

• Bribery and corruption 20% 

 

• Storage of personal data 

• Trustworthiness 

• Access to funds 

• Lack of transparency 

• Strict lending criteria 

 

 



 
 

15 | P a g e  
 

 

 

Another key threat in current practises is the risk of outsourcing, and the centralized nature of 

systems, making it less resistant to cybercrime and more susceptible to internal manipulation. 

Because it’s centralized, there is also strong resistance to change and vulnerability to independent 

system failures or attacks. [7] This issue is partially due to the poor design of technology used, as 

it’s based on paper orientated processes, rather than best practises enhanced with technology. 

The largest contributor to its failures is its exclusionary nature, preventing billions of potential 

customers from accessing such financial services. The result of this, is an outdated, inefficient and 

unsecured system that is ill-equipped to adequately satisfy the needs of individuals and business 

in a safe, reliable and user-friendly manner. 

 

The Opportunity  
After identifying the critical pain points, it seems an obvious solution is to bring the key financial 

services onto the blockchain. In this way, we can tackle these threats head on through the adoption 

of a decentralised and transparent method of service delivery. As there is no central organisation 

or intermediary involved, there is lower costs and better trust, as transactions are secured through 

cryptography and secret codes. This presents an opportunity for two parties to transact with one 

another directly, avoiding third party fees and delays, and building trust and terms that meet their 

needs, rather than being forced to adhere to third party demands. 

The consensus from market professionals regarding this disruptive technology has been largely 

positive. According to the World Economic Forum report on Disruptive Innovation in Financial 

Services, blockchain technology adoption in the financial services sector has the potential to “drive 

simplicity and efficiency by establishing new financial services infrastructure and services”. [9]

“57% of internal frauds in the 

financial sector are carried out 

by senior and middle 

management. This indicates a 

major problem with the lack of 

emphasis on personal integrity 

and ethical behaviour in the 

financial services sector.” [8]  

 



 
 

16 | P a g e  
 

 

Capgemini also revealed an estimated savings of $16 billion in bank and insurance fees thanks to 

blockchain smart contracts. [10] 

From this, we can identify a clear opportunity for enrichment. It is time to listen to consumers, 

appreciate their needs, empathise with their concerns, and address them head on with ‘SMART’ 

goals. In our effort to combat the challenges raised we have focussed on delivering a complete 

solution set that is: 

 -   Specific   -    Measurable    -    Achievable    -     Realistic     -     Timebound 

If we use the research available to us, adopt the latest technology available and combine our 

passion with innovation, we can create a suite of services to better cater to consumer demands. 

By bringing the three core functions of finance on the blockchain we can vastly improve and future 

proof services, with smart contract technology. That is why Etherecash has come into existence, 

with a view to revolutionising the basic essence of these services. 

  Lending: Peer to Peer Lending which is crypto backed for added security. 

Sending: Speedy Money Transfer on the blockchain worldwide using crypto. 

Spending: Multi Crypto Debit card for storing and spending your cryptos, both online 

and instore. 

By 2022 Santander InnoVentures suggests blockchain technologies could reduce banks’ 

infrastructural costs by $15-20 billion per year, not to mention significantly lowering annual 

maintenance costs. [11] The blockchain technology is expected to increase investor confidence as 

it promises complete irreversibility, almost instant clearing and reduced a margin of error.

The Challenges & How We Can Overcome Them  
The single greatest milestone in the adoption of any change is the willingness for change. First, we 

must realise the current scenario compared with blockchain scenario, to truly appreciate the 

challenge at hand.  

TRADITIONAL

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

From this we can establish a shift in the power dynamic from the intermediary to a distributed user 

community, where transactions are validated through a consensus mechanism. The Etherecash 

decentralized approach enables transactions to take place in accordance with smart codes and 

smart contracts that replace commercial agreements by digitalizing the business transaction, thus 

improving efficiency. 

Our primary goal is to bring transparency, reliability and simplicity to the industry through our 

smart contract technology, and we are witnessing a positive response from early contributors. We 

have invested heavily in research to educate our potential users, as knowledge brings 

understanding and builds confidence. We endeavour to make our concept, business model and 

token participation easy to comprehend with supporting reading material and tutorial videos to 

better explain our long-term goals and service provision. This white paper forms the backbone of 

the business model which has been carefully vetted by established legal houses. It is because of 

the involvement of our legal team in every aspect of our concept development that we are confident 

that we have identified a niche opportunity in the market, that is ‘SMART’ and will be supported 

due to its value creation and innovation in providing a future proof version of our current systems.

Our Solution  
Our creative thinkers and development team have explored this in detail, and it is through their 

efforts that we are able to bring you Etherecash. We all have basic questions in our minds, and 

now it is time for us to get answers. 

• -How can I send money to my family abroad instantly? 

• -How can I make better use of my Crypto which is sitting in my wallet? 

• -How can I get a loan in India, if my financial history is in Germany? 

• -How can I make repayments easily and avoid high international transfer charges? 

• -How can I encash my crypto in local currency? 

Well, with Etherecash you can! Let’s see how. 

Peer to Peer Crypto Backed Lending  
If you have cryptocurrency lying around, why not utilize it, to make more? Lend to borrowers 

internationally with ‘Borderless Lending.’ Get higher returns than typical Bank deposits through 

peer to peer lending, free from geographic and economic constraints. 

Etherecash opens new lending gateways by welcoming borrowers and lenders to a unique platform, 

where mutual terms are agreed in a ‘Smart Contract’. Loans on the Etherecash platform are 

executed using smart contracts which are deployed on the ethereum blockchain. This smart 

contract technology enables crypto backed loans to be issued, peer to peer. The crypto acts as a 

form of collateral removing several risks and facilitating an asset backed loan to take place. The 

borrower deposits their crypto as security and in return can borrow 70-80% of crypto value. The 

Lender is confident as the ‘Smart Contract’ is Lawyer backed, and repayments can be made 

instantly irrelevant of what country the borrower sits in, using the Etherecash Token. Against this 

collateral, a lender provides a loan to the borrower. The loan amount is sent using Etherecash 

tokens, and recorded in the smart contract. Once the smart contract terms are met and the loan 

is 100% repaid plus interest, the crypto collateral is returned to the borrower and the transaction 

is complete. Smooth, hassle free and border free. The creation of a ‘Borderless Loan Market’ creates 

more opportunities and better access to finance. Think of what we could achieve. 

• No counter party risk. 

• No need for capital reserves. 

• Easy collateral management. 

• Auto execution of terms with no third-party influence. 

• Transparent, quick and easy to apply.

The Etherecash system mitigates risk through the protocol agnostic technology which can auto 

manage and execute the crypto backed agreements between borrowers and lenders. The 

blockchain based asset loans are stored in Escrow wallets which are: 

 

 

• Multi-layered  

• Auto settlement 

• Lawyer backed 

 

 

Speedy Money Transfer  
Send money to anywhere in the world using the Etherecash cryptocurrency. Money transfer has 

never been easier, more secure and most of all private. Etherecash money transfer involves: 

• Connecting individuals 

• Global Network 

• Minimal Fees 

• Instant Confirmation 

• Pocket friendly 

• Make payments on the go 

• Secure and private 

As Etherecash is a digital currency, it automatically overcomes the characteristic issues of fiat 

currency such as transport and logistics. However, the uniqueness of Etherecash comes from its 

ability to be used across a number of functions, where the blockchain based money transfer 

element plays an important role. Simply, it acts as a bridge between all other functions.

Benefits of Money Transfer  
Money transfer as a service has long been a topic of discussion, particularly as we are a global 

economy with more and more of us moving towards a nomadic lifestyle. The prime obstacle 

standing in our way is borders.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Benefits of Crypto Debit Card  
Not everyone is aware or has a clear understanding of digital wallets for the storing of cryptos. 

However, by and large, people are well adept to using a debit card. This is the main reason we 

have tried to simplify the process further by facilitating our users to store and spend their cryptos 

directly from a multi crypto debit card.

Our Competitive Edge  
The Etherecash platform stands out from the crowd for two main reasons; Lawyer backed and 

Crypto backed. Consumers all want the same thing, peace of mind and security.  

Lawyer Backed  

Etherecash is backed by some of the top legal houses, with offices dotted in every key economy 

making them most equipped to guide us on international regulation for our three core functions. 

Our legal team has been involved in this process from the ground up, with regards to 

conceptualization, framework, development and registration, ensuring we have covered every 

angle from a legal perspective. As they say, ‘there’s no point in getting an architect after the house 

is built’. Therefore each aspect of planning and development has been executed with the legal 

framework and guidance embedded in our thought process. This is one of biggest competitive 

advantages that we hold over our competitors. Particularly, in an industry which is so complex and 

heavily regulated, we strive to a new level of transparency and trustworthiness in the services we 

provide. Much of these traits have disappeared from the finance industry since the 2008 collapse, 

and it’s about time, they were brought back.  

 

Crypto Backed  

Now let’s take a look at our second most competitive advantage, which is that we facilitate crypto 

backed loans. What this means exactly, is that a borrower who has a loan requirement can obtain 

one through our peer to peer platform, while still preserving his other crypto assets. Usually a 

person who is asset rich must consider liquidating some to generate cashflow and this tends to be 

in an unexpected situation or a case of emergency, when the market may not be in your favour. 

Not any more though, as Etherecash actually recognises your crypto assets as having worth and 

will facilitate a peer to peer loan at 70-80% of the crypto value equivalent in fiat currency. The 

infographic below explains the role of the crypto assets during the borrowing process. The crypto 

assets act as collateral and shall be retained on deposit for the duration of the loan, until all 

repayments and any interest has been repaid by the borrower. On clearance of the loan amount 

as per the terms of the smart contract the crypto assets will automatically be returned to the 

borrower. There is an opportunity cost where the crypto assets may have increased or decreased 

in value during the loan terms which we address on page 35 under Collateral Management. 

 

 

 

 



 
 

23 | P a g e  
 

A key benefit must be noted, and that is the ability for asset rich but cash poor individuals or 

companies to obtain a loan. As traditional lending institutions typically look for regular income in 

conjunction with an asset portfolio. There are a lot of people in this world that do not fulfil these 

criteria, and through the creation of our crypto backed smart contract, we are widening the 

possibilities for potential borrowers by increasing their access to a competitive loan market. 

 

How We Add Value  
‘Value’ is defined as a something of worth, high opinion or usefulness. Something which cannot be 

bought in this world is trust, and therefore the single most valuable attribute that any service 

provider should strive for. Hence, trust and transparency were the driving factors behind the 

conceptualisation of the Etherecash platform. By being proactive and listening to the demands of 

consumers in the industry, we have attempted to satisfy as many of these desires possible while 

still maintaining a ‘SMART’ business model.  

After careful assessment, we have decided to develop on the Ethereum based platform using 

ERC20 with a smart contract backed by our legal team. This combination of technological 

applications provides for the most efficient, secure, reliable and transparent system. In summary, 

this is how Etherecash will solve some key industry issues: 

• Automation of processes for better efficiency, saving time, reducing costs, streamlining 

processes to make them user friendly. 

• Improving access to information, creating transparency and building user confidence. 

• Digitalizing contracts which can be customized with mutual terms, which are irreversible, 

immutable, auto controlled and executed in accordance with the terms. 

• Securing of data through a distributed ledger which is stored on millions of devices reducing 

the risk of hack, cybercrime and internal fraud, more commonly seen in financial 

institutions. 

• Connecting borrowers and lenders in a peer to peer network, where trust and decisions can 

be made without the interference of banks and third-party intermediaries, and their costs. 

• Creating a more competitive market of finance so lenders and borrowers can have more 

opportunities, due to greater loan availability, and increase the potential for loans to get 

approved. 

 

 

 

 

 



 
 

24 | P a g e  
 

Business Model  
Etherecash acts a facility provider and charges a small service fee in Etherecash tokens for each 

transaction processed on the platform. This fee is utilized for platform strengthening, including 

ensuring our smart contracts are up to date and legally secured. It also helps fund the security 

measures taken to maintain a safe environment for our borrowers and lenders to interact. There 

is a small gas fee associated with the deployment of each smart contract on the ethereum system 

which is also covered through the service fee charged. 

The Etherecash token acts as a utility token, for fees to be paid on the platform. The types of fees 

shall include: 

• Transaction fees for each transaction processed on the platform. (Fixed percentage) 

• Transaction fees for each transaction processed using the crypto debit card. (Fixed 

percentage) 

• Gas fees required for the Ethereum system. (As per actual) 

• Contract fees for the smart contract loan agreement. (Fixed percentage) 

As part of our ecosystem development, our speedy money transfer facility will run using the 

Etherecash token exclusively, meaning all payment transfers will be done using the Etherecash 

token. This will ensure transactions can be made globally and quickly. 

The Etherecash token can be stored on our crypto debit card, so it can be spent easily. Consumers 

will be able to utilise the Etherecash token to satisfy their key financial needs to ‘Lend, Send and 

Spend’.  

Target Audience 
The target audience for Etherecash will comprise of EVERYBODY, but here are some examples to 

help you better understand: 

• Individuals 

• SME’s 

• Companies

Go to Market Strategy 
Etherecash has developed a strong market following through our efforts to educate people about 

blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts. There is a lot of uncertainty and hence our first 

stride was to help consumers to realise the need for change, the solutions available and why we 

should not fear being outside our comfort zone. 

Our initial focus has been online tutorials to broaden awareness and interest regarding blockchain 

solutions which can simplify tasks in our daily lives. This gave us a solid foundation to relate how 

blockchain technology and smart contracts could be used to bring transparency, greater 

accessibility and competitiveness in the finance industry. The advantages that can be achieved 

through Etherecash are relatable, honest and in demand. So, it is our goal to make this vision a 

reality. 

Etherecash ICO provides a medium for us to get to market in the most efficient way. While we 

have funded all our own research and development, marketing, testing, advisors, legal, admin and 

development to date, this crowd sale will enable Etherecash to go into full scale development, 

recruit the best analysts available and implement the highest security standards. Our road map is 

long term, our team is committed, and business model is ‘SMART’; Specific, Measurable, 

Achievable, Realistic, Timebound. 

 

 

 

 



 
 

26 | P a g e  
 

Our Platform  
The Etherecash platform uses the deployment of lawyer backed smart contracts on the ethereum 

system, to provide border free loans which are peer to peer and backed by cryptocurrency. The 

platform ensures that users information is private and secure, but the terms of contract are 

transparent and mutual. The smart contract is robust and coded to only execute according to the 

contract terms, making it free from influence, misinterpretation or manipulation. The Etherecash 

platform provides a fair network for users to connect with one another and transact peer to peer. 

It can be accessed with just a mobile phone and internet access, to facilitate lending ‘from’ any 

country ‘to’ any country, at any time, liberating the loan market. All the transactions which take 

place on the platform use  the Etherecash token, as a utility token. 

 

Key Features  
 

User Friendly Interface: Etherecash listened to the feedback of consumers with regards to 

complex and lengthy procedures. Based on this, the platforms core focus is on user experience, 

simplicity of procedures, and educational guides to teach and help our users understand how, 

where and why they should be using Etherecash to better satisfy their needs. 

Globally Accessible: The platform can be accessed from anywhere in the world 24/7. You can 

borrow or lend to anyone, anywhere, so global finance is always available to you, especially in your 

hour of need. No need to wait for the bank to open, just go online and get started immediately. 

Partial Funding: Lenders have the option to lend part of the loan amount, in conjunction with 

other lenders. This enables you to access bigger project loans with potentially more attractive 

returns. 

Flexibility: Whether you are a borrower, lender, sender or spender, the Etherecash platform 

provides you with multiple options for all your financial needs. With flexibility at every step of the 

way, Etherecash provides you with a complete service solution. 

Direct Matching: Based on the loan terms most desirable to you, the platform will suggest 

potential borrowers for you to lend to. The platform will also recommend some diversified partial 

loans to achieve your desired parameters, should you choose this option, spreading your risk and 

maximising your return.  

 

 

 



 
 

27 | P a g e  
 

Lawyer Backed: Our smart contracts are lawyer backed and designed to protect both parties for 

the duration of the loan term. We have placed foremost importance on this, as peace of mind is 

essential in any business transaction. Particularly as many of our users may be new to peer to peer 

lending, we have taken every step to build confidence and trust in our services. 

Crypto Backed: Collateral backed lending is commonly understood, and crypto backed lending 

operates in the same manner. A lender is secured as the borrower deposits their cryptocurrencies 

as collateral against the loan. The borrower is also satisfied as they can raise finance without having 

to liquidate their crypto assets. 

Due Diligence: Etherecash endeavours to meet all regulatory and legal guidance by enforcing 

KYC and AML policies to ensure we attract legitimate users who have the right intentions. We are 

encouraging transparency at every step of the process to maintain our standards in service delivery. 

S3 – Security, Speed, Service: The foundation of our business is built on delivering S3. We 

endeavour to provide the most efficient and user-friendly platform for a truly global marketplace. 

Reporting Analytics: Users shall have complete oversight of the marketplace along with their 

own portfolio through their dashboard. 

Technology  
Technology is generally used to simply or modify procedures or situations, and it plays the same 

role in the case of smart contracts. Traditional commercial agreements tend be complex, written 

in legal jargon, which is typically only understood by lawyers and they are too long. Smart contracts 

on the other hand, are not open to interpretation, have no double meaning, and are not open to 

change or manipulation. The terms are encoded in the system so there is no deviating from the 

original agreement, as the terms are executed automatically in accordance with the agreement, 

and it’s free from any third-party influence.  

In the sphere of lending, the adoption of smart contracts provides an opportunity to digitalize the 

agreement and secure both party’s interests. This can be achieved through the distributed ledger 

as each transaction is recorded in a decentralised registry. Each transaction is stored in a block 

which is linked to the previous block through a chain, ensuring the data is auto-summed and 

chronological. Each transaction is verified by the network community, ensuring consensus and 

transparency.

that permits the purchase of such services. 

• Must have a valid social security number or equivalent in the country of residence. 

 

Peer to Peer Lending Crypto Backed  

 

 

 

 



 
 

29 | P a g e  
 

 

Through the Etherecash peer to peer lending platform, there are two key aspects to consider: 

Collateral Management 

The Etherecash smart contract will monitor the prevailing market price of the collateralised crypto 

assets from a variety of sources. As the assets are dynamic and may fluctuate in price, the smart 

contract will reassess the valuation to match the terms of the agreed smart contract. 

• If the valuation falls below the threshold specified in the smart contract, the borrower 

will be notified. The borrower may choose to either add more crypto assets to the collateral 

to meet the terms of the contract or choose to liquidate the cryptos as per the prevailing 

market rate. 

• If the valuation appreciates above the threshold specified in the smart contract, the 

borrower will be notified. The borrower can choose to either withdraw part of the collateral 

as per the prevailing market rate, use the additional value to pay off part of the loan or 

choose to look for extended credit from the lender.  

Contract Enforcement 

The smart contract is designed to secure the terms of the agreement and auto execute in 

accordance with the terms. If the value of the collateral falls below the threshold specified in the 

smart contract and the borrower does not liquidate or add more cryptos to the collateral, the 

contract will ensure the collateral will be sent to the lender and liquidated at the prevailing market 

rates. The same will occur if the borrower defaults on their payments as per the terms of the smart 

contract.

Worldwide Money Transfer  

The Etherecash platform will facilitate speedy money transfer worldwide using the Etherecash 

tokens. Let’s see how it works. 

 

Crypto Debit Card  

The Etherecash crypto debit card allows you to store Etherecash tokens and ERC20 tokens on your 

debit card to be used at the point of sale, with instant conversion to fiat currency at real time 

market rates. The debit card can be used internationally or locally for hassle free spending. Here’s 

how it works. 

 

 



 
 

31 | P a g e  
 

 

Etherecash debit cards will be most beneficial to use in place of traditional cards, for the following: 

International Travel 

The Etherecash debit card eliminates the hassles of spending while travelling abroad. No more 

purchasing of local currencies, avoid international charges and no loss in conversion back to your 

primary currency. 

 

Remittance 

India alone received over $235 billion in remittances over the last 3.5 years. With Etherecash debit 

card you can manage your remittances easily, while saving time and fees. [19] 

 

International Online Shopping 

The global E-commerce market is estimated to be worth $22.1 trillion according to the UNCTAD. 

Now imagine if you could avoid the conversion rates and international fees usually charged, by 

paying through your Etherecash debit card. [18] 

 

Debit Card Features 

• Chip and PIN security. 

• Secured by Ethereum blockchain so tamper proof. 

• Extremely low fees when compared with traditional debit cards. 

• No credit history required. 

• No bank account necessary. 

• Quick and easy to sign up and get started.

Token Purpose  
 

Why a Token Sale? 

A token sale refers to the sale of cryptographic tokens generated through blockchain. It is usually 

offered to early participants in exchange for project related funding, to further develop the idea 

and technology as a means of adding value to their niche industry.  

At Etherecash, we feel that the use of blockchain in the finance and lending industry can provide 

revolutionary changes. The utilisation of a token during this process and the creation of a smart 

contract brings transparency and security to this process. The Etherecash token enables users to 

make faster, more affordable transactions and access lending from any country. 

Why ICO? 

We feel there is a need for improving access and methods of finance on a global scale. While we 

have explored a means of achieving this, through our extensive research and analysis, there is a 

timescale associated with any technological development. Through ICO, we can reduce this 

timeframe, connect with the best minds in the field and get to market faster. People have waited 

long enough for financial freedom, and we want to bring them one step closer. 

Etherecash Token  

The Etherecash token will act as a utility token used for paying for services on the platform. These 

services include loan facilitation, money transfer and crypto debit card. The Etherecash token will 

be the only accepted form of payment accepted on the platform. The token will be used to pay for 

transactions fees, gas fees and contract fees relating to the services rendered on the platform. In 

the case of loans, they happen peer to peer, and the initial loan amount is transferred from the 

lender to the borrower using the Etherecash token. The repayments plus interest are paid by the 

borrower to the lender using the Etherecash token. Money transfer works the same, where the 

sender transfers money using the Etherecash token and the receiver gets the Etherecash token in 

their wallet. Similarly, it can be loaded onto your crypto debit card along with other ERC20 tokens, 

and used to shop, spend or withdraw, and transaction fees will be charged in Etherecash tokens. 

The token operates as a utility token for paying service fees. If the token value increases, the 

platform will offer additional services only. This does not make it marketable or tradeable. Security 

trading is excluded from the platform.  

 



 
 

35 | P a g e  
 

 

Token Distribution  
The Etherecash ICO process will ensure we attract a diverse range of participants and a more 

democratic outcome. The plan for allocation of funds is milestone based, to ensure the focus is on 

planning and development and as per the road map. This will create confidence in early ICO 

participants, as our concept and implementation of the same is transparent and structured. 

There will be a total of 360 million pre-mined tokens in the Etherecash system. The distribution 

during ICO will be as follows: 

 

During Pre-ICO and ICO 144 million Etherecash tokens shall be distributed. 

- Soft Cap: $15 Million      -    Hard Cap: $100 Million

Participant Relations Strategy  
Etherecash encourages participation and feedback through our participant relations strategy: 

• Fortnightly newsletter with project news and updates for all participants. 

• Quarterly report of activities and events. 

• Bi-annual reporting of milestones achieved and financial reporting. 

• Quarterly webcast update from our CEO/COO. 

• Regular updates on roadmap developments and enhancements.

Safeguarding Participants 

By using crypto assets as a means of collateral against each loan, we are safeguarding our lenders 

against the loan issued. It can be compared to loans against gold which have been very popular in 

the past. We believe that through the Etherecash platform participants have full transparency to 

understand the purpose of the loan, and decide on the terms that best suit their needs. The 

flexibility and clarity we offer, enables participants to make smarter choices. Secondly the use of 

lawyer backed smart contracts builds confidence, assuring them that the terms shall be executed 

exactly as intended with no deviation, thus protecting them. 

Now let’s talk about our ICO participants. 

We have designed a fair bonus model to incentivise and reward early participants and contributors. 

Through our participation model, contributors can register on the Etherecash platform by sharing 

some basic information and fulfilling our KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements to adhere to the 

AML (Anti-Money Laundering guidelines. Participants can purchase Etherecash tokens with either 

Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) by making a transfer to the designated ICO wallet. The wallet 

balance shall be monitored to assess the total raised with a view to achieving our soft cap. The 

crowd funding will continue for the period of ICO and at the end of that period, if the soft cap is 

reached, then the project will be deemed a success and we will proceed with the roadmap planned 

for development. If, however the soft cap is not achieved during the period of ICO, we will be 

refunding all the funds to our participants. This assures our participants that in the event the ICO 

does not raise sufficient capital, their interests will be looked after and no loss shall be suffered by 

them.

document are based on past trends and data from third parties and other sources, which were 

believed to be reasonable at the time they were made. However, they still involve unknown risks 

and uncertainties, as it is impossible to predict anything outside of our immediate control including 

economic factors. Individuals and investors are requested to carefully consider the risks, costs and 

benefits of acquiring the token through this crowd sale as opposed to through a third-party 

exchange, once operational.

represent any future governance of the platform. By purchasing the Etherecash token you 

acknowledge that you have carefully reviewed the Terms of Purchase and fully understand the 

risks, and are permitted by law to purchase the token in your current given jurisdiction. You further 

represent and warrant that you are of legal age to be bound by these terms and will not hold the

Legal, Regulatory and Compliance 
Some of the elements of the whitepaper shall be governed by international legal terms. The 

Etherecash community extensively believes in best practice policies and procedures intended to 

ensure legal and regulatory compliance. Every registered user shall have to comply with the AML 

and KYC norms with respect to the global standards. Etherecash is committed to maintaining 

compliance with laws, regulation, and licensing with governing bodies to achieve sustainable 

growth. We believe in random securitization of the profiles of lenders and borrowers periodically. 

We intend to prepare a list of elevated risk profiles and would likely distribute and supply those 

information to government agencies as per their demand. Although, our platform is in no way 

responsible for risk management of lenders and borrowers engaged on our platform. Our platform 

will enforce the rules and regulation related to lending, the Truth-in Lending Act, user protection 

act, data security and deceptive business practices and other procedure intended as legal and 

regulatory compliance in the countries where our platform is operational. We desire to act with the 

highest standards of integrity, honesty, and accountability. Etherecash platform currently does not 

support registration for citizens and tax residents from the following countries: 

• United States of America, New Zealand, Canada 

• Somalia, Lebanon, Nepal, South Korea, Singapore 

• Central African Republic, Switzerland, Bangladesh, China, 

The Etherecash token shall not be offered for sale or sold to any person who is resident or situated 

in any state or jurisdiction where such transactions are not applicable by law or require specific 

licensing or regulatory approvals. Participating persons are independently responsible to determine 

such restrictions applicable to them directly and comply with them. 

Privacy Policy 
The profile of all members on the platform shall be explicitly confidential, and will not be disclosed 

to any other member on the platform unless an express consent is sought by the member. Data 

on the platform is held in a distributed way. This is important to avoid the user data breaches that 

befall centralized databases. With the Etherecash platform, loan collateral is independently secured 

in unique smart contracts associated with individual credit agreements. Continual development 

requires developers to have permission to access and to update the software and as a result, the 

back-end marketplace will be centralized and under the control of Lending as an organization. The 

platform inherits the trust sensitive aspects of the protocol tokens which underpin the product. The 

platform is committed to keeping any and all personal information collected from the individuals 

that visit our website and make use of our platform accurate, confidential, secure and private.
