Solve.Care Foundation was established with the mission to decentralize and redefine 
administration of healthcare and other benefit programs, globally. Solve.Care aims to alter 
the way healthcare is conducted around the world – while generating attractive value for a 
wide range of stakeholders composed of consumers, insurers and service providers.

Solve.Care allows direct interaction among consumers, insurers and service providers to 
improve health care access, reduce costs and streamline payments, regardless of whether 
it’s a patient, employer, insurer or government agency making a healthcare payment. We are 
seeking to improve care outcomes through effective coordination and eliminate much of the 
cost of duplication, inefficiency, waste, abuse and fraud from the system. 

By combining our deep domain expertise in health and human services, benefit 
administration and care coordination; with the latest advances in distributed ledger and 
distributed computing technology, we are able to design, build and launch a platform that 
will redefine healthcare for individuals, employers, providers, administrators, insurers and 
government agencies around the world.

The core of Solve.Care is grounded in the proven, tested advantages of applying blockchain 
technology – a distributed ledger approach utilized in real-time transactions – to a nation’s 
health care requirements.

What is Solve.Care Foundation?

OUR STATED AND PUBLISHED MISSION STATEMENT IS TO 
make healthcare and benefit programs work better for everyone, for 
ourselves, parents, children, society and our economy

Administrative and health information technology costs are high in the U.S and other health 
care systems around the world. IT systems that run the growing number of administrative 
functions continue to become more cumbersome and costly. 

There are numerous documented facts that show the current health information technology 
infrastructure has become less interoperable and unable to deal with the increased demand 
by both providers and consumers of health care services.  

All these factors lead to an increasing share of total health care spend being allocated to 
core administrative functions. That’s where Solve.Care comes in as a solution to many of the 
problems associated with health care administration and the wide range of functions 
required to administer health benefits in a seamless and cost effective manner with greater 
efficiency.  

It is reliably estimated that costs for healthcare administration range from 7% to over 30% 
of total healthcare spending, as a direct result of inefficient processes, data system silos and 
duplication of effort.

Solve.Care platform can perform the tasks of current processing and management 
systems at 3% of total spend through the use of Care Administration Networks thus 
reducing processing and management of systems and the potential to reduce overall spend. 

The growth of Blockchain technology is the paradigm shift in health 
care that will allow for true coordination of care administration that the 
Solve.Care platform can achieve.

We estimate that the addressable market size is in excess of $100 billion for the U.S alone 
and billions more in other health care systems around the world.

Solve.Care has become possible by combining decades of experience and domain expertise 
in insurance systems, government programs, clinical management, care coordination and 
employee benefits administration with recent technological innovations such as a 
Blockchain, smart contracts, machine learning, behavioral, clinical and transactional 
analytics.

Most of healthcare around the world is managed via the 3rd party model of 
administration and payment. This model results in patient going to see the doctor 
and a 3rd party (insurance, employer or government) paying the bill. 

07



Inefficiency of healthcare administration

Person receiving the benefit (service or product), person delivering the benefit and person 
paying for that benefit, are different. You go to the doctor and receive care but insurance 
company is responsible for paying the doctor. So, instantly there is a triangular relationship 
that is difficult to manage in the best of circumstances. When you add in the fact that most 
systems are not designed to effectively talk to other systems, the act of coordinating and 
managing benefits across multiple parties becomes an impossibly expensive and time 
consuming task.

2 Poor coordination and lack of integration  

Insurers, hospitals, labs, and pharmacies, all use complex, centralized logic to make decisions 
and you are excluded from that process. Most systems are designed to serve the consumer 
but in practice have distorted into treating you as a beneficiary not a decision maker. We are 
all excluded from the process that determines much of cost and outcome because we lack 
the capability of processing all the complex logic and the arrangements.

3 Disintermediation of the consumer 

Solve.Care platform is designed to replace centralized systems and duplicative 
administrative processes with a decentralized and synchronized model of 
administration that is highly efficient and effective for patients, care providers 
and administrators alike.

Things would work well when there is effective coordination between all 3 parties but that 
does not happen. Each party has different teams, systems and processes that don’t easily 
connect with the other party systems and processes. So, a lot of time and incredible 
amounts of money is spent each year on coordination and communication but it remains 
imperfect and keeps getting more complex. These system and data silos result in 15-25% of 
all money spent of benefits to be spent on IT, administrative processes and duplication of 
effort. And due to high latency, they are terribly ineffective in preventing fraud, waste and 
abuse.

3rd party model of administering benefits is very complex to manage
and very expensive because of these facts:

1 Centralized systems and information silos 

08



Solve.Care platform is designed to completely redesign and 
automate this process using Care.Wallet, Care.Cards, 
Care.Coins and the synchronization power of Care.Protocol

Current model of care coordination requires considerable manual effort from all parties, 
starting with patients and extends to doctors, eligibility workers, case managers, billing 
agents, reviewers, auditors and many more. A consumer needs a Ph.D. in healthcare 
finance to figure out the process and many with an actual Ph.D. cannot. This approach 
needs to change.

Care.Cards are portable applications that reside in the Care.Wallet. Care.Cards are equivalent to
apps in an app store that can be downloaded from the Care.Marketplace. However, unlike
generic apps, Care.Cards have access to all the platform constructs including Care.Protocol 
Pairs, Care.Coins, Care.Vault etc.

Care.Cards represent an incredible opportunity to build intelligence into 
the platform to automate healthcare administration, effectively coordinate 
care between multiple stakeholders, handle complex billing transactions 
and deliver personalize information to the wallet holders.

Care.Cards have unique capabilities that make
them a powerful tool of intelligent automation:

Intuitive data security model of public and private side
Care.Cards can be published for a specific protocol pairto followthe rules of that pair

13



Care.Coin 
Care.Coin is an intelligent healthcare payment currency designed to reduce cost of healthcare 
administration and reduce fraud, waste and abuse. 
Care.Coin is designed to support a relationship centric model of payment and automatically 
inherits the relationship rules for the transaction. Care.Coin can verify and enforce relationship 
rules in real time during payment lifecycle.

Care.Coin brings Proof of service model to healthcare. Proof of service is a score of events in the 
Blockchain ledger to establish evidence of service delivery and can be computationally 
determined based such events: 
Schedule, consent, diagnosis, prescription, lab, referral, follow up etc.

Care.Coin represents a new way to detect abuse by automatically computing proof prior to 
payment For example, an insurance company can use Proof of service in conjunction with billed 
amount and past billings to easily determine if the bill needs to be reviewed further prior to 
payment. 

Care.Coin enables escrow based payments and can automatically release monetary value upon 
sufficient proof of service. Care.Coin can remove much of the friction, cost and risk from 3rd 
payment model.

Care.Coin has the potential to fundamentally change healthcare payments 
and remove the friction from 3rd party payment model

Healthcare and benefit administration lifecycle typically involves several parties to 
participate. These parties collectively manage activity, manage costs, deliver proper care, 
ensure proper outcomes and maintain privacy of information and security of systems.
 
One of the biggest challenges is keeping all parties in sync and sharing the right information 
with the right party at the right time. For example, a doctor must bill the insurance company 
for services provided to the patient, but must not disclose all information about the condition 
and treatment, only as much as needed for insurance company to determine the cost.

Care.Protocol is the underlying fabric of the platform and handles all communication and 
synchronization between entities, wallets, cards, coins and client systems. Care.Protocol 
enables synchronization and secure communication between two entities defined as a 
protocol pair.

Using pair definitions such as Doctor-Patient, developers can easily publish 
cards that synchronize scheduling, manage consent, recommend treatment, 
issue pharmacy prescription, review lab results, send bill, receive accurate 
payment and schedule follow up.

Care.Community can develop new protocol pairs and publish them on 
Care.Marketplace. 

Care.Protocol combines the power of Blockchain 
(distributed ledger technology) with event based 

architecture and handler to keep all parties in 
sync without the need for a centralized 

record keeper.

Care.Protocol.Pair makes it possible 
for developers and integrators to easily 

publish Care.Card applications that can 
automate interactions between parties, 

without dealing with the underlying complexity. 
Once a Protocol.Pair is defined, Care.Cards smart 

applications can be easily developed and published 
by the community and clients.

Clients can configure own
care administration networks

Care Administration Network is an ecosystem that connects all parties involved in the 
administration and coordination of a healthcare benefit program. 
Clients such as insurance companies, government agencies, hospitals, provider networks, 
employers and benefit administrators, can create own care administration network using 
Solve.Care platform. 

Care Administration Network connects all members in the eco-systems in real time. Care 
administration network is designed to automate most administrative processes while 
delivering real time coordination of care and benefits.

The advantage of such a Care Administration Network is reduction in administrative costs; 
real time and more effective care coordination; elimination of duplication of services; 
reduction in fraud, waste and abuse of the program; and empowering the consumer with 
access and control over their information and decisions.
Members of the network use Care.Wallet to communicate and synchronize their activities 
with each other in a highly efficient manner. Member wallets can contain the necessary 
Care.Cards for access to appropriate information and ability to take action.
 
All members in the network are connected and automatically synchronized with each other 
by the underlying Care.Protocol which is built using Blockchain distributed ledger 
technology. Care Administration Network can be open, closed or a hybrid that connects to 
another network for specific purposes.

Consent cards allow exchange of consent for treatment, records, billing, payment, emergency, 
compliance and many more scenarios requiring consent. Consent cards don’t need centralized 
storage and can be made public or kept private between the pair and selectively shared with 
other stakeholders in the ecosystem by the consent provider.

Scheduling cards bring ease of usage to citizen when trying to find a physician based on 
proximity, language, gender and availability and automate schedule changes, switching to 
alternative care provider and more.

Treatment cards organize treatment information, diagnosis, emergency procedures and can 
link to lifestyle cards to manage diet, exercise, sleep, stress etc.  Public side of treatment card 
stores information that is needed by other stakeholders and private side contains treatment 
data that is shared only between the pair entities.

Prescription cards are used for sharing and managing order, refill, dosage, drug interactions, 
formulations and much more. Prescriptions cards can synchronize with treatment, insurance 
and other cards.

5 Laboratory cards are used to manage laboratory results, comparison with other card, trend analysis and for coordination of care between patient, doctor, specialist and other
stakeholders.

6 Referral cards are powerful agents of synchronization of care and link to other cards such as 
authorization, records and scheduling.  

Let us take a look at the various interactions 
that occur between a doctor and patient 
and resulting activities that requires care 
coordination.

Record cards are organized into deck of cards by type, episode, provider, and timeframe and 
provide access control and history of all prior access. Record cards are powerful way for a 
consumer to access and manage records that are spread across multiple EMR/EHR.

8 Bill cards are designed to automate and organize billing and payment information between 
doctor-patient pair and automatically synchronize with insurer-patient and insurer-doctor pair.

Payment cards help card holder decide on what to pay, whom to pay and ensure that proof of 
service and proof of verification has been logged, prior to payment. Payment cards are 
powerful tool of control and transparency in the entire billing and payment process of 
healthcare and benefit administration.

Care.Protocol Design

Care.Protocol is the foundation for the event based approach and is designed to deliver events 
to all parties to whom event is of interest. Each entity can read an event by pairing with an 
entity, subscribing to an event and accessing an event ledger. Access to events is based on 
public-private hierarchy with all events that are stored in Blockchain ledger. 
Care.Protocol is built using event based architecture and manages events between all 
components of the platform and between physical and logical entities. It is a proprietary event 
handling protocol to organize event hierarchy and event flows.

INNOVATIVE COMBINATION OF BLOCKCHAIN
AND EVENT MANAGEMENT

Protocol.Pairs is a powerful innovation to make decentralized administration of healthcare and 
benefit administration possible. Care.Protocol creates an organization model of entity pairs 
called Care.Protocol.Pairs. Care.Protocol allows each entity in a pair to have a 32-digit protocol 
ID and using the protocol ID, entity registers on the network to form protocol pairs. They “sign” 
a contract that binds them to rules of relationship with Wallets, cards, coins, endpoints which are 
then governed by pair rules.  A protocol pair captures all elements of the relationship. Protocol 
pair definition is kept in the Blockchain and is contract between parties.  Each pair is also bound 
to a smart contract on the Blockchain.

Care.Protocol.Pair encapsulates all elements of relationship
between two stakeholders as follows:

•  Content, transactions and formats
•  Rules and constraints
•  Public and private data
•  Synchronization
•  Consent and proof
•  Audit and compliance
•  Security and access control

Protocol pairs can support multiple event types and related permissions defined by event originator. 

Events can be grouped into:

• Pair event is published to specific entity you are paired with. Pair event is automatically 
visible to both entities in the pair but no one else in the network.
•   Group event is published to a group of pairs and can be accessed by entities in those pairs.
•   Network event – published to all pairs and is accessible to all entities in the network. 
However access to event payload is strictly based on access.

25



EVENT PROPERTIES

•  Delegated events – event authorized for publishing to a delegation (non-pair)
•  Subscribed events – events can be read from the distributed ledger directly

Events have one primary and can have multiple secondary tags to capture:

•  Access rights
•  Transaction reference
•  Control information
•  Query-Response information
•  Admin information
•  Additional tags can be defined and are visible to protocol pair entities
•  Access to tags beyond paired entity can be controlled

Events are a key construct of Solve.Care platform. Event handler has the ability to track all 
events in an immutable ledger, ability to separately manage events versus payload, store 
events in Blockchain versus payload and separately manage access to events versus payload. 
Here is an illustration of how event handling is done via Care.Protocol

26



PROTOCOL.ENDPOINTS
Care.Protocol Endpoints are connection and synchronization points for external systems. 
They are designed to support stateless and stateful interaction with external systems, using 
appropriate transport protocols.
Care.Protocol.Endpoints can be built for synchronization with clinical, eligibility, enrollment, 
financial, care and case management, and government systems. Care.Protocol.Endpoints can 
support any encryption and network protocol security standard that is appropriate and 
required.
Care.Community can publish new endpoints to address specific requirements dictated by 
external system, regulations and standards.

DATA MODEL
Solve.Care data model is a key determinant in achieving a flexible, expandable and evolving 
platform for benefit administration across the globe. The data model follows the 
decentralized design of the overall solution approach and is expandable by the community.  
Solve.Care data model supports decentralized entities that publish data to remain in sync 
with each object having a defined linking and data syncing definition. This approach makes it 
very flexible, powerful and expandable with protocol pair’s encapsulation of pair intelligence 
and transactions.

CARE.WALLET SERVICES
Care.Wallet publishes a number of microservices for access by Care.Cards and Care.Coins 

•  Identity services
•  Protocol services
•  Data services
•  Device services
•  Subscription services
•  Personalization services
•  These services are abstracted for ease to use and compatibility with multiple devices

Community/clients can leverage these services to publish intelligent cards and manage coins.

CARE.CARD ACTIONS
Each card corner can be associated with actions:
•  Link card to other cards
•  Flip between public and private side
•  Share card with another entity/wallet
•  Control permissions and access
•  Search card or deck
•  Custom action defined by card developer
.

27



SMART CONTRACT LIBRARY
Solve.Care platform uses Smart contracts to implement business logic specific to 
Care.Protocol pairs.
•  Pair-specific business logic defined by smart contracts
•  Smart contract can invoke another smart contracts
•  Administrative and payment relationship between an entity pair can be controlled via 
smart contract attached to that pair

Contract Types
•  Access contracts
•  Data collection and use contracts
•  Privacy and security contracts
•  Consent contracts

•  Compliance contracts
•  Subscription contracts
•  License contracts 
•  Permitted use contracts

Examples of Protocol Pair Contracts

Insurer ↔ Provider 
•  Credentialing contracts
•  Pricing contracts
•  Performance contracts
•  Payment contracts

Insurer ↔ Insured 
•  Eligibility contracts
•  Enrollment contracts
•  Utilization contracts
•  Payment contracts

SECURITY AND PRIVACY
A key concern with any health benefits system is once of privacy. Benefit information is very 
sensitive and governed by numerous regulations, standards and security considerations. In 
many ways, the argument and justification for current silos of centralized systems is based on 
the need to secure consumer and health data and compliance with relevant rules.

Solve.Care is designed to improve the security and privacy while also improving access and 
accountability in a manner that current centralized systems cannot accomplish. Every 
transaction that happens in Solve.Care is immutable, instantly verifiable by all authorized 
parties.  Solve.Care is designed to work with existing protocols, standards and formats of data 
while adding a decentralized audit trail for all events that occur at application and protocol 
level. Solve.Care protocol is expandable and serves as an envelope in which content in any 
format can be safely delivered to the right party for the right duration. Clients and community 
can expand the Solve.Care security model to address the needs of privacy and portability of 
data and still leverage their existing and planned security frameworks. 

ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES
Solve.Care platform uses a number of innovative technologies including Blockchain for 
distributed ledgers and immutable audit; smart contracts for encapsulating pair relationships; 
extensible application container; embedded data management; embedded identity and 
access management; embedded machine learning; and embedded behavioral analytics.
Solve.Care will be built using the Ethereum Blockchain protocol.

Important Disclosures
Recently the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission have issued a number of findings and 
advisories about participating in Initial Coin Offerings. We believe it is important to address 
the concerns raised by the SEC and other international securities regulatory bodies and how 
the Solve.Care Token Sale will operate and focus on the application of Blockchain 
technology with the use of a digital token as means to facilitating our goals of technology 
development and deployment. We are of the opinion that the offering for the development 
of our technology is not subject to SEC guidelines and this Token Sale offering addresses the 
general concerns and due diligence issues raised by the SEC Bulletin in Initial Coin Offerings 
in Token Sale of June 25, 2017. (See https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts- 
and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings).
 
The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act 
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United 
States or to or for the benefit of US persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities 
Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the 
Securities Act is available. The tokens offered for sale (Care Administration Network CAN) 
are deemed to be a utility and will be used to purchase future services and software.

One such exemption allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for 
investment purposes only by investors who (I) are not otherwise affiliated with the 
Solve.Care Foundation, (II) have been exposed for some time to the economic risks that 
ownership of tokens entails, and (III) are not part of the distribution of the tokens. Purchase 
of tokens does not mean you are vested with any rights for acquiring of securities under USA 
jurisdiction or other jurisdictions where it is not provided by applicable legislation. 

Ownership of tokens serves only as the mean to enable usage and interaction with the 
platform if successfully completed and deployed and right to purchase software and services 
from the Solve.Care Marketplace. It implies that you (a legal or natural person) participate in 
crowdfunding process as contemplated by the Whitepaper. You are purchasing Tokens solely 
for the purpose of accessing and the use of the Platform, and supporting the development, 
testing, deployment and operation of the Platform, being aware of the commercial risks 
associated with the Solve.Care Foundation and the Platform.  

Solve.Care Foundation is not liable for not strict following of the Product Roadmap. Product 
Roadmap is the best guess, but it may change. The Product Governance will review and 
adjust the roadmap every 6 weeks to make it relevant.
