Abstract

There are still more than 2 billion unbanked people in the world. These people are 
excluded from the local and global economy as they still use cash and don't have 
access to basic financial services. Taking out a loan is a great challenge for them as well 
unless they obtain a credit history.

MicroMoney’s mission is to solve this problem. 

MicroMoney was established as a microfinance institution and has sharpened the 
business to become a decentralized Open Source Credit & Big Data Bureau on the 
Blockchain. Since 2015, we provide individuals and SMEs with short-term loans as the best 
solution for their financial needs. MicroMoney uses innovative risk scoring powered by 
artificial neural network.

In the long-run, we are able to help 2 billion unbanked and underbanked people to build 
a multi-purpose digital identity, creditworthiness, and financial reputation. Without 
borders or intermediaries. Our goal is to bring these people to the new global 
decentralized crypto economy.

At the same time, we aggregate large sets of data reflecting our customers’ needs and 
their online behaviour. By sharing and exchanging this Big Data we thus enable banks, 
financial institutions, e-commerce, and retail businesses worldwide to efficiently scale. 
They will get access to new customers unserved before, reduce risks while expanding to 
new markets, and better understand their customers’ needs.

Currently, MicroMoney is establishing new branches in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the 
Philippines. The next target countries are Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
Nigeria, and China as a promising market. These branches will start operating in Q3 
2017 - Q1 2018. For the purpose of further business expansion and developing new 
products, MicroMoney has decided to start a Token Distribution.

Financial services for unbanked and underbanked, Big Data, Blockchain 
technology and A.I. scoring for business. All this combined with worldwide 
franchise constitute MicroMoney ecosystem.

Introduction

According to a McKinsey Report, in 2010 2.5 billion adults, just over half of the world’s adult 
population, did not use formal financial services to save or borrow. Despite the movement 
towards financial inclusiveness, in 2017 there are still about 2 billion people in the world 
without formal banking. That means they are forced to use cash in their daily life and have no 
chance to address their urgent needs by applying for banking services. Borrowing from 
friends and family is the most common source of urgent finances because their loan 
applications are hardly approved by banks. The reason is always the same: they have no 
credit history. Although financial organizations declare that there are fewer and fewer  
unbanked each year, those who remain in an unbanked or underbanked status do not have 
an easy way to solve their situation.

What are the trickiest things for banks to include such people into their customer base? 
Unbanked are profitable at large, but they involve higher risks and lower margins. Blockchain 
technology offers an answer to classical but outdated banking restrictions. It provides 
financial institutions with a way to increase market competition and to make a product 
revolution in financial services. The current situation enables and even forces all market 
players to provide fast and  affordable services for the financially excluded worldwide.

Today we can say that savings and lending services constitute human rights. Moreover, 
financial services have become one of the main sources of income for state economies, 
encouraging the development of other industries. Providing the unbanked with access to 
wider financial opportunities means a higher standard of life globally: better education, 
medical care, establishing new small businesses, and improving the state’s economy.

Market Overview

Emerging markets show interesting statistics: they have a high percentage of the 
unbanked and underbanked, and a high penetration of Internet and mobile services 
at the same time.

Here are some examples of countries and regions demonstrating these trends: 

80% of the population does not have a bank account 
but 63 out of 100 people use mobile phones. Experts 
expect this factor to help solving the banking services 
availability problem as it provides an opportunity to 
unbanked individuals to access banking services via 
their mobile phones.

Currently, India is the world’s fastest growing Internet 
market with a user base growth of 51.9% 
in 2015. However, India’s unbanked population 
would be the world’s 7th-largest2. A report3 prepared 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2015 pointed out  
India’s unbanked population that year to be 233 
million.

China has 731 million internet users with 53.1% 
of the population online. And 95% of users access the 
Internet from their phones. The country shows a fast 
development pace but still has 21% of the unbanked4.

Pakistan showed 185% growth of mobile broadband 
users, but 100 million Pakistanis are still unbanked5.

The Asian region overall  is expected to be the 
world’s fastest growing Internet region by 2020. It 
shows a growing amount of Internet users, 
extending mobile phones penetration and 
increasing usage of social networks.

According to Google and Temasek, by 2025 the South East Asian Internet economy is 
expected to reach USD 200 billion, strengthening its already strong and growing GDP of USD 
2.5 trillion. With its mobile connection growth rate higher than the global average (124% vs. 
103% respectively), and its Internet speed expected to reach the global average of 23.3 Mbps 
soon, the region’s Internet industry is flourishing. Furthermore, as of January 2017, social 
media penetration of its member countries is high (statement out of the blue, needs 
supporting data).

At the same time, only 27% of the South East Asian population has a bank account. In poor 
countries like Cambodia, the numbers fall to about 5%. That corresponds to about 438 
million unbanked in the region. 

In Myanmar, the smartphone penetration stands at 58%, higher than the global average of 
37% and the regional average of 47%. In the meantime, Myanmar has one of the lowest 
banking penetration rates in Asia, with over 85% of adults (aged 15+ years)  unbanked. 
Central bank data suggests that outside Yangon city, the unbanked comprises more than 
95% of the population, and only 1 million households have a credit card. As a result, 95% of a 
population of over 50 million depends on about 5,000 unofficial money lenders and “loan 
sharks”.

The Global Problem

As people worldwide lack access to basic financial services, they have limited capacity to 
overcome poverty and to increase their living standards. That implies a lack of access to 
both banking services (loans, mortgages, or bank accounts) and access to all other services 
and opportunities. No credit history means limited access to banking services, which 
means no loans and, no credit history… However, there is hope to break this vicious circle.

There is a large percentage of unbanked individuals in the Asia-Pacific Region, which is now 
home to more than half of the world’s internet users, 54% of the world’s social media users, 
and 56% of all mobile social media users. This trend proves that although most Asian people 
may be unbanked, digital services and innovative solutions have improved people’s lives. 
And we are here to help bring all those millions of people to the new global crypto economy.

Our Solution

Giving micro money to people

MicroMoney is a team of professionals experienced in working in emerging markets. 
There are 196 countries in the world, and 100  of those countries represent our target 
market. Who are our potential clients? They are more than 2 billion of unbanked people, 
they run cash-only households, have no credit history, have no debts, and widely use 
smartphones and Facebook. They are the so-called “blue collars” and “white collars”, and 
SMEs. Their monthly income is around $200-500.

This implies a huge amount of new customers and we are here to bring them to the new 
global crypto economy. 

In an emerging market, a smartphone can tell us everything we need about its owner, so 
that we can estimate his/her creditworthiness. No joke, your smartphone knows you 
much better than even your best friend.

So we made an app, which gathers 10,000 parameters. We analyze this Big Data using our 
AI Neural Network Scoring and this is enough to obtain a loan approval decision in just 15 
seconds. Now, to borrow money using our app is as easy as to order an Uber. Of course, we are 
always improving the system too.

We realized that 90% of our customers take the first loan in their life. At the same time, we 
were overwhelmed by the idea: by providing money to people, we are not just helping to 
address daily needs. We are helping to create a digital financial identity, to build 
creditworthiness and reputation and to start their credit history.  

And if we want to improve the lives of over two billion people, we must give them access 
to the global economy. How? 

Building and Open Source Credit Bureau on Blockchain

Loans through smart contracts, transparent and reliable credit history. We must 
enable businesses to get access to our customers, offering them the best service  
possible.

Providing Big Data for Businesses

Our products represent a digital financial identity encrypted on the Blockchain and Big Data 
gathered from borrowers’ smartphones. That Big Data of previously unserved customers 
becomes really useful for business: people need money and services, while businesses 
need new customers.

As you can see, we started as a company fully focused on micro-financing in the money 
lending industry, aiming to provide the best solution to individuals and SMEs. But nowadays 
we are proud to be a Fintech company, working towards the goal of  global financial 
inclusion.

Since 2015, MicroMoney has been successfully operating in Cambodia. In 2016, we started 
in Myanmar and have since decided to expand worldwide. In 2017, MicroMoney established 
a back office in Thailand for the purpose of reducing operational costs and making further 
expansion in region: Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
China. 

Expanding Worldwide

While considering scaling our product, we have identified100 most populated countries 
with billions of unbanked and a huge demand for our main solutions.

We took this idea from McDonald's and completely standardized and packed our business 
processes in our CRM system (BPM`Online). It is now a ready-to-go Franchise Financial 
Platform. Hence, expanding to new countries and opening new branches  has been 
dramatically simplified.

How does the MicroMoney Work?

Our History: Two years of hard work
MicroMoney was established as a company focused on micro-financing in the money lending 
industry. We aim to provide the best solution to individuals and SMEs to meet their financial 
needs. MicroMoney is successfully operating in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where 
our back office is located. 

We provide customers with online loans without any collateral requirements. Clients can get 
the money by just filling in the application form on our mobile app. Using machine learning 
algorithms, we can approve a loan in just 15 seconds and are able to deliver the funds in 1 
hour. After setting up our branch in Cambodia it took only 3 months to make the business 
profitable. Founded in 2016, MicroMoney Myanmar is equally showing stable performance 
growth. 

Two years of diligent work have resulted in a unique scoring technology, a wide network of 
business partners, and stable business growth. As for customer feedback, our Facebook page6 
reached more than 500 thousand followers, and our app7 in Google Play has a customer 
rating of 4.8 out 5.

We have more 95,000 registered users, of which 90 percent took out the first loan in their 
life. About 73% got back to us for a second loan. Currently, our retention statistic show an 
average of 4.5 social/emergency loans per client.

accomplish that, MicroMoney has formed a team of technical and business experts. We 
constantly update our financial products, produce educational content, and expand the 
business to new markets. 

in December 2015, we issued 21 loans, only ~$800 in total. By the end of 2017, our 
disbursement volume will reach $4.9 million. 

Two years of profitable business has proved the robustness of MicroMoney’s existing 
business model. The behaviour of our customers shows that there’s a high demand for 
micro-loans among individuals and SMEs who previously didn’t have access to financial 
services.

Scoring App Powered by Artificial Neural Network 

A borrower’s smartphone is an efficient 
tool to check his creditworthiness.

Our technical experts have developed a 
unique scoring algorithm based on artificial 
intelligence and machine learning. By now, a 
precise prediction about the borrower’s 
trustworthiness is made based on around 
10,000 parameters collected and analyzed by 
an algorithm. We constantly improve the 
system to get more precise predictions. Given 
that the scoring system uses machine 
learning, the more data we collect, the better 
predictions we obtain from it. 

As a result, our system delivers a predictive 
score in accordance with the global FICO 
system. 

Once our app81 is installed, the customer signs 
an agreement on personal data processing. In 
addition, to the data submitted 
on the form, the scoring system analyzes the 
user’s behaviour during the application 
process, as well as his contact list, calls, SMS, 
web behaviour, etc. We also receive data from 
social networks used by a customer. 
Eventually, are able to we acquire a very 
detailed customer profile92. 

Through our use of the system, we are able to provide microloans to the unbanked and 
underbanked without a credit history, aggregating Big Data simultaneously.  

We are seeing a strong market uptake for this type of Big Data analytics from the financial, e-
commerce, insurance and telecom industries.

Some of the parameters we collect and analyze:

NeuralNetwork, www.extremetech.com

Example of how we analyze Big Data by using Microsoft Azure Neural networks

how long does it take for the 
borrower to fill in each field;

how many seconds he doubted 
when typing his home address;

how many times he changed 
the salary field;

at what time of the day or night 
the application was filed;

what music is in his playlists; 

how long does this person use this 
smartphone; 

how often does the customer 
call relatives, and whom he calls;

do we already have clients from 
his contact list, and what’s their 
reputation.



17

Neural Network predictive scoring gives MicroMoney a variety of advantages: 

Financial risks while working with new clients are drastically reduced. Scoring 

costs are one order less than those for traditional banks and MFIs.

We are able to confidently work with any type of clients (including 2 billion of 
the unbanked, who have no credit record but are smartphone owners).

While expanding to a totally new market, our risks are much lower compared to 
our potential competitors from the very first day of operations. 

Aggregated Big Data is useful for any other business: banks, financial companies, 
insurance, e-commerce, and retail.

Risks of loans non-payment

Our scoring algorithm is a self-learning system: the more loans we give out, the 
better its prediction works. Therefore, it significantly reduces the risk of loan non-
repayment. With each new country launched, we gain access to huge data sets 
processed by our algorithm, improving it even more.

The table shows approximate risks of non-repayment of a loan by category over time. As it 
can be seen, the longer the loan is overdue, the higher the risk of non-repayment. For the 
loans with no overdue payment (“0->3-30” lines in the table), the risk of non-repayment 
decreases from 44% (for first loans on a totally new market) to 3% in the third year of 
operation.

The Values That We Provide

MicroMoney for Crypto Community: Developing a Crypto 
Ecosystem

According to our long-term strategy, we see MicroMoney as part of a crypto ecosystem. 

Our goal is to enable Blockchain companies to efficiently scale their customer base by 
getting access to our open source credit bureau. Providing our partners with data on millions 
of un(der)served people, we are going to bring those customers to the new global crypto 
economy. 

We are already working towards this goal. In August 2017, we signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with Everex e-wallet (raisng more 60,000 ETH during their token distribution). 
Using Everex’s e-wallet, we will start disbursing “crypto-cash”, thus our customers will get 
their first loans in cryptocurrency (stable tokenized local currencies).

As a next step, we consider integrating with these high-tech products: 

Everex Cross-border payment system. 

Getting crypto-cash for our borrowers.

GOLEM Decentralized supercomputer. 

Deploying AI for our scoring and risk analytics solutions.

Civic To improve borrower’s identification and verification.

Hive Providing funding for our SME customers.

Tether Alternative Payment system.

COSMOS Network and framework for interoperability between blockchains.

Uport Global, unified, sovereign customer identity system.

Sonm Supercomputer. Deploying AI for our scoring and risk analytics solutions.

OmiseGo Alternative Payment system and e-wallet.

MicroMoney for people: Providing Micro-loans and Creating 
Reliable Credit Histories

Immediate loans for 2 billion unbanked and underbanked 

Problem

Depending on the country, it’s 
hard or impossible to get 
unsecured loans for 
individuals without a credit 
record. 

Problem

To receive the loan 
in a bank or MFI, a long list 
of verific tion documents 
and collateral is required.

Solution

MicroMoney enables clients 
with no credit record to take 
out short-term loans. 

Solution

MicroMoney clients get 
immediate loans by applying 
online through a mobile app. 
No collateral or additional 
documents are required. 

Market research shows that existing financial institutions in emerging Asian economies 
still cannot sufficiently address consumers’ needs for short-term loans:

Banks: 
Documents: ID + Family book + recommendation from police station + salary slips 
+ recommendation from work. Collateral. Guarantor.

Micro Finance Companies: 
Documents: ID + Family book / recommendation from police station / additional documents.
Collateral or Multi guarantors ( group loans )

Pawnshops: 
Documents: ID. 
Collateral Guarantor: Needed (Gold, Electronics etc.).

Unofficial Money Lenders and Loan “sharks”: 
Documents: ID, Recommendation by existing client / Referral.
Collateral Guarantor: Negotiated.

going to implement Everex’s e-wallet in order to, provide our customers with loans in 
cryptocash.

Documents required: Applying online. Loan approval is based on our own scoring algorithm 
(see respective paragraph for more details) + analyzing cash fl w of borrower.

Helping our clients to build a credit record for the future

Problem

Lack of a centralized credit 
records database, lack 
of  Credit Bureaus in most  
Asian countries. Therefore, 
clients can’t build their credit 
record for the future.

Solution

MicroMoney enables 
clients to build and secure 
their credit records for the 
future  through 
a blockchain-based credit 
record database.  

By 2014, only 12.6% of the adult population in Cambodia had a bank account or an account in 
any other financial institution, and at the same time according to The World Bank statistics, 
about 60% of the adult population reported not borrowing any money (by themselves or 
together with someone else) for any reason and from any source in the past 12 months. 
Similar statistics were demonstrated in Myanmar: 22.6% and 42.8% respectively. This means 
that 1 million people were either using unlicensed sources or receiving payday loans from 
pawn shops in cash. By doing so, they are not building their credit record, and, more 
importantly, their financial ecord will be totally lost simply by relocating to another town. 
MicroMoney provides each client with a scoring record using a global score, similar to “FICO”. 
MicroMoney credit record database is being moved to the Blockchain, which guarantees 
safety and credibility of the information.

Problem

The overwhelming majority 
of Banks, MFIs, and pawn 
shops still operate offlin 
or partially offline. 

Solution

MicroMoney grants  
short-term loans by using an 
online-only model with 
no paperwork in just 15 
minutes.

The financial ma ket landscape in the Asia region clearly demonstrates 
its readiness  for an online-only business model: 

Asia Pacific is a home to 3,8 billion people111. 

According to Statista122, smartphone penetration is going to reach 35% across Asia Pacific 
(1.3 billion sma tphones). At the same time, smartphone penetration in big cities and 
capitals has already reached 60% and keeps on increasing.

An easy way to deliver and collect money due to well-developed and affordable money 
remittances with local payment systems. Banking payments are available for repayments 
as well.  

E-signing is recognized, thus all agreements may be executed online. It’s possible to 
confirm identity and execute scoring online. 

There are no restrictions on digital advertisements for money lenders, which makes lead 
generation easier. We pay less than 1 USD for each reliable borrower!

Simple legal setup. In the majority of countries licensing is very easy or not required for 
money lending as long as deposits are not taken. There are mostly no regulations about 
the loan amount, its terms, and effective interest rates.

According to The Global Findex Database131, only 4% of the unbanked adults declare that they 
don’t have a bank account because they just simply don’t need one. 355 million people have a 
bank account and still transfer money in cash142 within a country. MicroMoney call-center helps 
to open a bank account or install an e-wallet on the borrower’s smartphone. Thanks to 
MicroMoney’s consultants, thousands of customers have opened their first ever bank a count.

Problem

Unbanked and underbanked 
people are not familiar with 
types and conditions of 
financial services they may

Private credit bureau coverage (% of adults).

MicroMoney for Business:  
Acquiring New Customers by Using our Big Data 

Big Data & Credit Record Bureau on Blockchain

Even in countries with a developed lending market, credit bureau coverage remains low. For 
instance, in Indonesia, there are almost 10 thousand lending entities operating. Still, there are 
no countrywide credit bureaus. This inhibits market development and is detrimental for both 
business and customers.

According to The World Bank statistics153, only 12.69% of the adult population with middle 
and low income is covered by a private credit bureau in Asia. There is still no coverage in some 
countries Myanmar and Indonesia.

26

Problem

Establishing any financial 
business in Asia may be 
complicated because of 
high risks. Lack of credit 
bureaus inhibits market 
development and harms 
both businesses and end-
customers.

Solution

MicroMoney is going 
to provide paid access* 
to collected credit records, 
and exchange data with 
business partners. 

* In case borrower’s permission is
granted. 

Big Data collected by MicroMoney may provide business value for banks and MFIs. It could be 
beneficial for e-commerce, telecom, and insurance industries as well. The data at 
MicroMoney’s disposal helps to facilitate access to a new audience, segment potential 
customers by interests, and effectively target consumer offers. Thus, the business gets an 
opportunity to reduce risks, and MicroMoney customers receive more advantageous 
consumer offers.

Protection of personal information is our top priority. We respect our customers’ 
personal data and never pass it to a third party without the customer’s consent.

Market Uptake and Use Cases

We want to enable worldwide banks, financial companies, e-commerce, and retail businesses 
to efficiently scale and serve more customers, who had no access to their services before.

We want to enable Blockchain companies to efficiently scale their customer base by 
providing them with access to an open source credit bureau with millions of un(der)served 
people. We want those people to become a part of the new global decentralized crypto 
economy.
MicroMoney will provide access to its data through an API platform. Our technical expert 
team is constantly improving the algorithm that processes information. Within several 
months the entire pool of existing credit records will be moved the Blockchain. Therefore, 
the safety and reliability of the collected information will be guaranteed.

For now, we keep credit records and customer data in our Big Data Warehouses. The records 
will be transferred to a Blockchain ledger after the completion of the Token Distribution. Our 
goal is to make MicroMoney a decentralized database of credit records and Big Data Bureau 
on a Blockchain. Our technology will allow our partners to backup borrowers’ personal data 
(e.g., credit records or any other data we get from their smartphones) in a secure, private, and 
anonymous manner.

Big Data for Banks

Banks are using extensive budgets to attract and verify their customers. According to our 
own sources among customer acquisition professionals, the average US bank pays from $10 
to $100 to acquire and check each new customer, with prices in Europe being only slightly 
lower. Each time a bank sends a credit offer to its client (via SMS or e-mail), it is forced to pay 
a regular credit bureau, and therefore the cost of an issued loan grows. For MicroMoney, the 
cost of acquiring 1 reliable borrower is just $1 and banks can buy credit records from our 
Credit Bureau using our tokens.

Big Data for microfinance, finance, and insurance companies

Businesses may want to expand to countries, where we already operate. Still, they face 
high risks as there is no nationwide credit bureau. Therefore, the population of those 
countries represents a large grey zone for them.

Big Data for e-commerce, and retail businesses

We can help e-commerce and retail to get new customers from our database or to better 
understand what those new customers want. For example, we can determine from a 
client’s Internet browsing history that he was looking for a baby stroller recently. Therefore 
e-commerce may offer him to buy diapers  at the nearest shop.

Exchange mechanism

Any business user (for instance a bank or e-commerce company) can exchange his 
credit records for our credit records. Both parties profit from this transaction.

Market uptake is rising

We forecast high demand for our Big Data and credit records. We are developing an 
open source credit bureau  where depersonalised data will be fully free of charge. 
Access to personalised information and AI Neural Networks Predictive Scoring will be 
granted on a paid basis (only if a customer agrees to share his personal data with third 
parties).

What is an AMM token:
The AMM ​token ​is based ​on ​a ​proven ​risk ​​management ​​and ​​Big ​​Data ​​platform.
The ​token ​is ​part of our ecosystem and is used within the platform in different ways. The 
token serves as the fuel of the MicroMoney ecosystem and has been designed so that our 
customers will want to use it frequently. It is a token that can and should be bought on 
exchanges at prevailing market prices.  

1. Partnership access - AMM ownership will give access to advanced platform’s
features. For more details, please see the MicroMoney Partnership Program section
below.

2. Encouragement and rewards - First, borrowers in MicroMoney are rewarded with an
AMM bonus for paying back their loans in time while delays cause the AMM bonus to
decrease depending on the overdue time. Second, if a borrower has others vouching
for him or her and all the payments are made in time, the co-signers will receive AMM
tokens as a reward as well.

3. Every time MicroMoney receives a payment for personal details, credit history and Big
Data, the customer will be rewarded with AMM tokens. This is part of the client's
digital reputation. MicroMoney respects personal details of all our clients and will
never disclose any information with third parties without consent from the client
himself.

4. A collateral - AMM can be used as collateral to secure a loan application allowing
customers ​t​o ​​achieve ​t​he ​l​ower ​r​ates ​​and ​t​he ​​other ​​possible ​​privileges ​​and ​​discounts.

5. Getting payable access to customer big data & credit histories. Banks, financial and
insurance companies, e-commerce, retail and telecom businesses should use tokens
to pay for accessing personalised information in the Big Data & Credit Histories
Bureau.

6. Getting payable access to the Decentralised A.I. Neural Network Scoring system.
Banks, financial and insurance companies, e-commerce, retail and telecom
businesses should use tokens to pay ​for the accessing Decentralised A.I. ​​
Neural ​​Network ​​Scoring ​​system.

7. The right for any contribution to the system to support Sustainable Development
Goals. We support SDG program of United Nations: No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Quality
Education, Gender Equality, Decent Work and Economic Growth, Reducing
Inequalities.

We can also say that AMM is a MicroMoney “in-game” token, and participants of the 
MicroMoney Ecosystem are rewarded for performing certain actions. Also, the token can be 
used to pay for and unlock certain ​in-game resources. 

The  AMM  token provides multiple features within the MicroMoney’s financing platform: 



36

MicroMoney  Partnership  Program 

Additionally, AMM tokens are a key component of MicroMoney’s partnership model. Tokens 
represent the right to use the MicroMoney platform and access specific services and 
functions based on the number of tokens that are held in a partner’s wallet. Tokenholders 
contribute to the development of the MicroMoney platform by way of donation during the 
initial token distribution because it is the only way to access and use the platform’s various 
services. Customers who want to use MicroMoney’s features should buy the token on 
exchanges ​​at ​​market ​​prices. 

Buying and holding AMM tokens provides the access access to a number of features within 
the MicroMoney platform. These features are described in the AMM Partnership Program 
Mechanism section below. 

1. Franchise partnership - AMM ownership can allow tokenholders to become
MicroMoney’s ​​partner ​i​n ​​a ​​specific ​​country/region ​​on ​​an ​​exclusive ​​basis.

2. Access to the Decentralised A.I. Neural Network Scoring System - Banks, financial
and insurance companies, e-commerce websites, retail outlets, telecommunication
companies, and other corporates can access our Decentralised A.I. Neural Network
Scoring ​​system.

3. Access to customers’ Big Data - Customers of our Big Data Bureau (banks, financial
and insurance companies, e-commerce websites, retail outlets, telecommunication
companies, and other corporates) can get access to customer data which can be
mined.

4. Access to customers’ Credit Histories Bureau - Banks, financial and insurance
companies, e-commerce websites, retail outlets, telecommunication companies, and
other ​​corporates ​​can ​​get ​​access ​t​o ​​our ​​Credit ​​Histories ​​Bureau.



37

AMM ​​Partnership ​​Program ​​Mechanism 

The sale and use of AMM tokens are structured in a way to encourage business 
stakeholders to buy and hold the tokens in relation to what each stakeholder wants to 
achieve with the MicroMoney platform. In this regard, AMM tokens can be thought of as in-
app tokens which unlock specific features based on the quantity and the value of the tokens 
held by the token holders. 

1. Exclusive ​​Partners ​​​must ​​buy ​​and ​​hold ​​USD ​​100 ​​000 ​​worth ​​of ​t​okens.
Exclusive Partners are given a specific territory on an exclusive basis in which they
can operate a MicroMoney franchise. Exclusive Partnerships are limited to one per
country or region. In addition, Exclusive Partners also have access to the full
functionality ​​of ​t​he ​​MicroMoney ​​platform.

2. Strategic ​​Partners ​​​must ​​buy ​​and ​​hold ​​USD ​​15 ​​000 ​​worth ​​of ​t​okens.
Strategic Partners are given access to the AI Neural Network and revolutionary
Scoring ​​System ​​solution.

3. Senior ​​Partners ​​​must ​​buy ​​and ​​hold ​​USD ​​10 ​​000 ​​worth ​​of ​t​okens.
Senior Partners are given access access to the big data collected by MicroMoney for
specific regions. Senior Partners do not get access to the AI Neural Network and
Scoring ​​System.

4. Junior ​​Partners ​​​must ​​buy ​​and ​​hold ​​USD ​​5 ​​000 ​​worth ​​of ​t​okens.
Junior partners are given access to the credit histories of national customers or other
specific territories. Junior partners do not get access to the AI Neural Network,
Scoring ​​System, ​​or ​​big ​​data.

5. Partners ​​​must ​​buy ​​and ​​hold ​​USD ​​500 ​​worth ​​of ​t​okens.
Partners are given access to the credit histories of local customers. Partners have no
other ​​access ​t​o ​t​he ​​MicroMoney ​​platform.

For example, let us look at a country like Vietnam. With a population of over 90 million 
people, the initial distribution of tokens is estimated to look something like this (assuming a 
token ​​value ​​of ​​$1/AMM): 

Partnership ​​Level Number Number ​​of ​​Tokens Token ​​Value 

Exclusive ​​Partner 1 100 ​​000 USD ​​100 ​​000 

Strategic ​​Partner 10 150 ​​000 USD ​​150 ​​000 

Senior ​​Partner 50 500 ​​000 USD ​​500 ​​000 

Junior ​​Partner 75 375 ​​000 USD ​​375 ​​000 

Partner 250 125 ​​000 USD ​​125 ​​000 

Totals 396 1 ​​250 ​​000 USD ​​1 ​​250 ​​000 

MicroMoney has designed its payment structure for services rendered to incentivise 
corporates to become partners of the MicroMoney ecosystem. Corporate Partners are still 
expected to pay for services rendered, but because of their commitment to MicroMoney, 
they ​r​eceive ​​a ​​discount ​​of ​​up ​t​o ​​20% ​​on ​t​hose ​​services ​i​f ​t​hey ​​pay ​i​n ​l​ocal ​​currency.  

Additionally, MicroMoney is prepared to provide a further discount of 20% to its Partners 
(10% for non-partners) in the event that invoices are paid for in AMM tokens. Not only does 
this provide a fiscal benefit to our clients, but this structure helps to increase the circulation 
of ​​AMM ​t​okens ​i​n ​t​he ​​economy. 

Services ​​Payment ​​Structure 

Payment ​​Method Partner Non-Partner 

All ​​Fiat 20% 0% 

All ​​AMM ​​Tokens 40% 10% 

AMM ​Provides ​Access ​for ​Technical ​Partners
MicroMoney’s Artificial Neural Network Scoring System will eventually become an open 
source code. Programmers can further develop and refine the AINN code or build services 
that can be sold through MicroMoney’s platform. Technical partners will be rewarded for their 
efforts by being paid in AMM tokens for refining the scoring system or by earning AMM 
tokens through a revenue share model for any services that they sell through the 
MicroMoney ​​platform.  



39

The sale and use of AMM tokens are structured in a way to encourage technical 
stakeholders to buy and use the tokens to access the platform’s source code. AMM tokens 
can be thought of as in-app tokens which allow users to help develop the artificial 
intelligence programming that is the technical foundation for the MicroMoney platform. This 
will help expand the usage of MicroMoney’s platform, its solutions, and its tokens. 
Additionally, this feature will provide goodwill because of the crypto community’s involvement 
in ​t​he ​​development ​​of ​​MicroMoney’s ​​software. 

AMM  is ​a ​Means  of ​Payment
In addition to proving access to MicroMoney’s various corporate and technical partners, 
AMM tokens can be used as a means of payment within the MicroMoney ecosystem. Using 
the earlier example, if MicroMoney charges a normal client $3,000 for the Big Data service in 
a specific region, a Strategic Partner or a Senior Partner, who have already bought and held 
the appropriate number of AMM tokens, would avail of the same service for $2,400. To pay 
for the services, the client or Partner could either pay in AMM or Fiat in local currency for the 
payment. 

User ​​Case ​​Scenarios

Scenario  1  -​ MicroMoney ​Expands ​to  Vietnam 

With a population of over 90 million people, the initial distribution of tokens within 
MicroMoney’s Partnership Model is estimated to look like this (assuming a token value of 
$1/AMM): 

Partnership ​​Level Number Number ​​of ​​Tokens Token ​​Value 

Exclusive ​​Partner 1 100,000 ​​AMM USD ​​100,000 

Strategic ​​Partner 10 150,000 ​​AMM USD ​​150,000 

Senior ​​Partner 50 500,000 ​​AMM USD ​​500,000 

Junior ​​Partner 75 375,000 ​​AMM USD ​​375,000 

Partner 250 125,000 ​​AMM USD ​​125,000 

Totals 396 1,250,000 ​​AMM USD ​​1,250,000 

Each of these partners will have the appropriate levels of access to MicroMoney’s features 
and ​​services ​​with ​​a ​​discount ​​of ​​20-40%.

Scenario ​2 ​-​  AMM ​Used ​as ​Payment ​Means 

Looking at the same operation in Vietnam, let us assume that the following represents 
MicroMoney’s business in a given quarter (assuming the token value has risen to 
$1.50/AMM):

In this scenario, MicroMoney Vietnam has generated revenue of $5.1 million in one quarter 
(before all discounts) through the various services offered in the ecosystem. This money can 
be paid to MicroMoney Vietnam either through fiat (in local currency) or through AMM (at the 
prevailing market value, which we assumed was $1.50/token for the purpose of this 
example). If clients choose to pay their invoices in AMM, they will get a gross discount of 
nearly ​​$2 ​​million.

*These prices are purely hypothetical for the purpose of this example and will depend on a

variety of factors. Final prices will be determined by MicroMoney when they launch their 
services ​i​n ​​each ​t​erritory. 

AMM ​​Token ​​Value ​​Proposition 

The AMM token is the key component of the company’s lending services and the main tool 
of ​t​he ​​MicroMoney’s ​​customers ​r​ewarding ​​system.  

Borrowers are rewarded with additional AMM tokens if they pay back the loan according to 
the lending contract conditions. In addition, users can vouch for the borrower with their own 
AMM tokens and in case the loan is paid back in time both the borrower and the vouching 
user ​​are ​r​ewarded ​​with ​​AMM ​t​okens. 

Borrowers can also use AMM tokens as a form of collateral in order to potentially reduce 
interest rates. By holding and pledging AMM tokens, a borrower is signalling his intention to 

pay back the loan on time. For MicroMoney, the tokens mitigate default risks and allow for 
loan approvals and even lower interest rates. In case a borrower is unable to fulfill his 
obligations to MicroMoney, a smart contract calls up the tokens and they are transferred to 
MicroMoney.  



42

Our management team has a development and expansion plan in place that indicates that 
MicroMoney will be operating in 47 countries within 5 years. By that time, we expect that 
75% of our tokens will be held by our various partners. As MicroMoney’s network and 
operations grows, we will need a greater number of partners to best represent each 
franchise within those countries. With an increasing number of partners, more tokens will 
have to be bought from the market. This will ensure that the value of AMM tokens will rise. 
With the simple example above, we have illustrated that each country will require a 
significant ​​number ​​of ​t​okens ​i​n ​​order ​f​or ​t​hat ​​country’s ​​operations ​t​o ​​be ​​well ​r​epresented.  

MicroMoney is operating in three countries today and has already signed agreements to 
expand to three new countries by the end of 2017 (Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the 
Philippines). With 47 countries left to expand to by 2022, and after having already identified 
another 50 countries where MicroMoney can expand to in the next 10 years, it is clear to see 
there will be no shortage of demand for AMM tokens in the market for at least the next 
decade. People who participate in the initial token distribution will see an incredible rise in 
value ​​of ​t​heir ​t​okens ​​as ​​MicroMoney ​​continues ​i​ts ​​expansion ​​efforts.  



43

Token Distribution Structure

The Reasons for Success  
and the Effect we will Achieve

Technologies are not able to earn money on their own but their users can.

When we are talking about access to lending, we do not mean the services: we keep in 
mind all the real problems people can solve with these tools. We want customers to 
confide technologies, banks to believe in customers, and customers to trust banks. All the 
tools we bring to the market help not only to make loan processes easier for financial 
organizations but also to remove barriers for the borrowers financially excluded. It is a Win-
Win situation for banks reaching all the necessary data without huge expenses for the 
market research as well as for the customers achieving all the opportunities the market can 
offer while keeping their privacy secured.

As MicroMoney builds the decentralised Big Data & Credit Bureau, the ambitious and wide-
range blockchain project, the company is able to change the emerging markets’ finances 
allowing to cut the cost heavily and to make lending services available for 2 billion of 
unbanked people worldwide for the first time in their lives.

We accept credit availability as the part of human rights for people to be educated, to get 
medical care, to create own businesses, and to improve quality of life.

Two billion of the untapped adult population globally can obtain the same market 
opportunities as the “banked” people have right now. What kind of technologies can do it? 
These are neural networks, blockchain, AI, mobile scoring and Big Data. The thing is that 
almost a population of a large country – 2 billion – can live happier than before with the 
help of the aforesaid technologies.

To be included in the financial system and to improve life quality, people need just two 
things - access to the available funds and the tools to receive this access. Here is 
MicroMoney to  help both with the access and the tools.

A way to inclusion

A way to well-being
