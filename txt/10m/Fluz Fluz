Executive summary

3

The Consumer Problem

Consumers everywhere want to stretch 

their money, especially when it comes 

to essential household purchases like 

telecommunications, food, gasoline, 

travel, pharmacy, apparel and so on. 

Currently, there is no adequate way 

to bundle the purchasing power of 

a consumer’s extended social network to 

get cash rewards. The tools in place are 

incapable of meeting customer demand 

because they are time consuming and 

complicated to use. At the same time 

bargaining power is shifting away from 

consumers towards larger merchants.

The decentralized cash back 

solution

Fluz Fluz disrupts the traditional 

shopping experience through an 

alternate, more rewarding avenue. 

In the current Fluz Fluz consumer 

network model, all participants 

make money, thereby creating 

high consumer stickiness and 

a sustainable business model.

Fluz Fluz’s stickiness is derived from 

the fact that current network members 

(aka Fluzzers) can generate 

cash back rewards through their 

everyday household purchases and 

the purchases of their extended 

social network. Fluz Fluz operates as 

an instantaneous digital retail code 

marketplace where consumption codes 

can be redeemed at retail POS, and 

generate Fluz points for the purchaser 

and their participating upstream network. 

In our binary network model each 

Fluzzer’s network can grow up to 65,535 

members through 15 downline network 

levels. The total cash back is split 50/50 

between the purchasing Fluzzer and the 



participating network.

In the Fluz Fluz model, there are no fees 

or hidden costs and only the network’s 

consumption, the mere invitation of new 

members is not rewarded.

Consumers are free to reflect  their normal 

consumption habits and preferences on 

any of the available retail partners. As 

long as the Fluzzer makes at least two 

monthly item purchases of any value or 

retailer through the network and remains 

active on the site under a “give and take” 

logic, he or she can generate cash back 

through the purchasing power bundling.

Benefits for Market Participants

Consumers, our so-called “Fluzzers”, 

can earn thousands of dollars every 

month from their network’s combined 

purchases. Moreover they can transfer 

Fluz (cash back rewards or points) to 

anyone in their network in an easy-to-

use mobile environment. Fluzzers can 

instantly begin earning cash without 

changing their shopping or work habits 

by digitally purchasing and redeeming 

Fluz Fluz gift cards from a variety of 

everyday retailers. Large merchants 

benefit through Fluz Fluz by bundling 

consumer demand and receiving 

consumer insight. Smaller merchants 

benefit by acquiring new customers who 

are part of the Fluz Fluz network.

Role of Blockchain in Fluz Fluz

Eco-system

The Fluz Fluz business model is ideally 

positioned to benefit from blockchain 

technology. Currently, the model is up 

and running in an off-chain environment, 

but intends to switch gradually to the 

blockchain technology in order to 

sustain the scale-up to a global consumer 

cash-back network based on digital gift 

cards. We recognize that blockchain 

is an evolving technology and that the 

current eco-system of traditional third 

party merchants and consumers will only 

allow us to implement a transformative 

vision of the rewards industry in a step-

by-step approach.

Conceptual differentation of Fluz Fluz 

from similar competitors:

Premier Network Seats Membership

The FLUZ token can be used to purchase 

premier network seats membership. 

It is intended that once the blockchain 

platform is developed, the premier seat 

membership may be bought and sold.

This may be facilitated through a private 

seat membership exchange provided 

by Fluz Fluz where people exchange 

information on seat performance and 

agree with each each other directly 

on a individual price of the seat. 

The Fluz Fluz team is working on trying to 

bring new and exciting additional utilities 

to the token and these will be notified in 

due course to all token holders.

Community superpower utility of 

FLUZ tokens

Community building and consumption 

networking is at the core of the Fluz 

Fluz model. In order to further propel 

consumption team building, the 

attachment of FLUZ tokens to a Fluzzers´s 

account - premier seat or normal account 

membership - grant communication 

packages to the downstream network.

Our experience has shown that an 

active consumption motivation and 

communication can further boost cash 

back performance and cohesion.

1 Fluz token linked to an account grants 

the possibility to deliver 1 personalized 

message (previously verified for not 

containing inappropriate or offensive 

language) to a specific downstream 

network member per month.

With for example 65,535 FLUZ tokens 

attached to an account, the Fluzzer is able 

to communicate a 1 message per month 

to his/her total network if completed.

A premier seat member Tier 1 (Tier 2), 

is equipped from the start with a credit 

of 20.000 (10.000) messages to his/her 

consumption team.

When tokens are detached from an 

account, the unused community 

messaging credit is lost and not restored.

FLUZ tokenholders through the 

community superpower might also be 

eligible for other features within their 

network such as birthday FLUZ giftings, 

merchants suggestions voting system, 

special deal eligibility and others to 

enhance community consumption and 

strengthen their specific network. The 

details of these features shall be released 

during the implementation roadmap.



FLUZ coins accumulation

and redemption for gift card

purchases – Future

Together with the launch into the US 

consumer market, Fluz Fluz will look 

to transition its current Fluz points to 

FLUZ public  exchange ERC20 based 

Fluz coins enabling accumulation of 

cash-back rewards in FLUZ coins as well 

as redemption of FLUZ coins for new 

gift card purchases. Using an ERC 20 

compatible FLUZ coin as a cash-back unit 

would allow Fluz Fluz to offer its users to 

freely trade their cash back rewards on 

public exchanges thereby offering an 

enhanced value proposition over limited 

loyalty programs from the old economy.

Note: The Fluz rewards coin is unrelated 

to the FLUZ token.

FLUZ Token sale and premier

network seats membership

Fluz Fluz intends to quickly deploy the 

consumer network model in the United 

States and develop a token based gift 

and rewards network that connects 

merchants with customers.

The foundation of 
the Fluz Fluz global 
consumer network 
and the parallel US 
market entry provide 
the ideal setting for 
a crowdsale model.

Together with the US market launch, 

Fluz Fluz will introduce a single global 

consumer network. This means that new 

users joining the cash back network 

in any future country where Fluz Fluz 

where Fluz Fluz is able to launch local 

retail redemption options including the 

United States, will all enroll on the same 

unique binary network.

7



Within this global network, Fluz 

Fluz is offering a total of 16.383 

premier network seats (see graphic). 

These  premier  network  seats  

membership  can be acquired through a 

qualifying amount of tokens. 

Given the absolute network structure of 

Fluz Fluz, individuals and companies all 

over the world may consider acquiring 

the tokens necessary for a premier seat in 

the global consumer network. Naturally, 

the earliest joiners have the highest 

probability in the shortest period of time 

to start receiving cash back rewardsfrom 

their downstream network´s purchases.

8

As more and more consumers join the 

binary network they will be automatically 

allocated horizontally to the next free 

seat, therefore filling the network layer 

by layer. This auto-fill mechanism is 

complemented with the individual 

invitation possibility of new users. Each 

user is able to directly invite friends and 

families into his/her extended network.

In conclusion, a premier seat 

membership oriented token sale favours 

the self-sustaining upstart of the model 

over any other fundraising mechanism 

and gives Fluz Fluz the strength to 

quickly implement its rewarding model 

into the world´s largest consumer 

market. The presented crowdsale of 

FLUZ tokens also favours the desired 

effect in which premier seat members 

become the first consumers, advocates, 

beneficiaries and/or multipliers of the 

newly formed global consumer network.

Token Economy

We will be issuing FLUZ Tokens that have 

the function of activating premier seat 

memberships on the Fluz Fluz global 

network. Qualifying Token holders will 

be able to activate premier network 

seats membership in the newly formed 

global consumer network ahead of the 

effective operational launch and enjoy 

the community superpowers for their 

consumption team building.

Token Crowdsale: 

Start Date: 18th of January 2018

Total FLUZ tokens available:

204,780,000

Token Crowd Sale Price: USD 0.10

Accepted currencies: ETH, BTC, FIAT

Token Reserve and Token Supply

A maximum of  204.780.000 FLUZ tokens 

will be issued in the phase before the 

operational US launch. Any unsold 

tokens will not exist after the tokensale.

Premier Seat Membership

There are 2 kinds of 

premier seats membership: 

Tier 1 and Tier 2.

With 10.000 accumulated tokens 

a Tier 2 premier seat membership 

may be activated by the Token 

holder. The Tier 2 premier seat 

is one of only 12.288 premier seats 

membership right after the 4.095 Tier 1 

premier seats membership in the global 

consumer network.

Tier 2 seat members can enjoy 

the exemption from the minimum 

consumption rule for a period of 12 

months after the operational launch 

in the US market and thenthe company 

require Tier 2 premier seat members to 

make at least one annual purchase of 

USD 10.

With 20.000 accumulated tokens a Tier 1 

premier seat membership may be activated 

by the Token holder. The Tier 1 premier 

membership is one of only 4.095 premier 

10

membership in the global consumer 

network and that enjoys exemption 

from the minimum consumption rule 

for a 12 months with the company 

thereafter requiring at least one annual 

purchase of USD 10.

Premier Seat Membership:

Tier 1 and Tier 2

Although it will depend on individual 

network consumption and growth levels, 

in Colombia for instance we are already 

observing in less than one year of 

operations early network users receiving 

hundreds of dollars every month in cash-

backs.

Token Relation to Premier Seats

Membership Activation

The sum of all Tokens of this 

issuance equals the sum required 

for all offered premier seats. Thereby all 

qualifying tokenholders are guaranteed 

their seat, should they choose to activate 

it ahead of the operational launch 

in the US.

Once a Tier 1 or Tier 2 premier 

membership is activated through FLUZ 

tokens, the tokens loose the premier 

seat membership activation capacity. 

They retain their community superpower 

utility.

30 days before the operational Fluz Fluz 

launch in the United States and thereby 

the launch of the global consumer 

network, qualifying token holders 

will be able to activate their premier 

seats membership. All qualifying token 

holders will enter into a pool of random 

premier membership allocation within 

their respective tier level to define 

their exact seat. This will guarantee the 

most transparent network premier seat 

membership allocation

12

If in the event that ahead of the random 

premier seat allocation there are more 

Tier 1 qualifying token holders through 

the concentration of token purchases 

than the 4.095 available Tier 1 premier 

seats, the random selection mechanism

will decide which Tokenholder receives 

a Tier 1 seat membership or as an 

alternative two Tier 2 seats membership.

If in the event there are less than 16.383 

premier membership activations, the 

remaining premier seats of both Tiers will 

remain blocked in the global consumer 

network for future allocation.

Once a Tier 1 or Tier 2 premier 

membership is activated through FLUZ 

tokens, the tokens loose the premier 

seat membership activation capacity. 

They retain their community superpower 

utility.

12



The Milestones

As per Dec 2017 the company is 

transacting in Colombia and has built:

1. A robust digital gift code marketplace

2. A strong and growing consumer 

network that is already generating 

real income for tens of thousands of 

consumers and where early joiners are 

already making several hundreds of 

dollars month on month.

3. Signed retail partners in every product 

category resulting in over 3,000 locations 

now processing digital gift codes with 

Fluz Fluz technology

4. A world class off-chain application 

with functioning features like gift card 

purchase, gift card storage, gift card 

re-sending, points transfer, cash-out 

requests, in-built messaging

service, bitcoin payment gateway, 

consumer network graphic view, 

individual reference code and geo-

localized store search for redemption.

Roadmap

Once the Token sale is successfully 

finished, Fluz Fluz will start its usual 

launch preparations for the US market 

entry.

Thereby we will follow a proven retail 

redemption approach focused on 

nationwide operating merchants which 

should give us an ideal kick-start for the 

US launch.

Based on this past experience and the 

Fluz Fluz existing operational bases, 

we target an operational launch in the 

United States for Mid 2018 supported by 

elements from the blockchain technology 

outlined in this whitepaper.

Mission & Role of Blockchain

Role of Blockchain

in Fluz Fluz Eco-system

The Fluz Fluz business model is ideally 

positioned to benefit from blockchain 

technology.

Currently, the model is up and running 

in an offchain environment, but but will 

look to switch gradually to the blockchain 

technology in order to sustain the scale-

up to a global consumer network based 

on digital gift cards. We recognize that 

blockchain is an evolving technology 

and that the current eco-system of 

traditional third party merchants and 

consumers will only allow us to implement 

a transformative vision of the rewards 

industry in a step-by-step approach.



Market & Consumer

29

A. Digital gift card market

There is great potential in the digital gift 

card market. Reliable numbers are

scarce but in the United States, we see:

“The total gift card market is an estimated 

$307 billion. The potential for the

entire gift card market by 2024 is $698.2 

billion USD. In North America, about

23% of all mobile commerce is gift card 

sales, and if we assume that percentage

holds true for United States, almost $46 

billion could be the market for electronic

Gift Cards. According to First Data, the 

global leader in payment technology 

and services solutions which acquired 

Gyft, estimated in 2014, that virtual and 

mobile cards are near $100 billion in U.S. 

gift card market. In Latin America, only 

3% of its online commerce is paid by gift 

cards, showing potential for growth.”

C) The sum of

There are 3 ways of looking at our potential market:



30

B. The Network Marketing market

The Network Marketing and Direct Sales 

profession hit a new record in 2013 with 

$178 BILLION in global sales. That’s 

up from $167 Billion in 2012. Network 

Marketing is a BIG business!

Roughly $71 Billion (40% of the $178 

Billion), was paid directly to distributors 

via commissions. That’s $6 billion a 

month, or $200 million a day!

billion, representing a 12% decline as 

compared to the previous year.

As of end-2015, Amway was followed 

by Avon ($6.2 billion), Herbalife ($4.5 

billion), Vorwerk ($4 billion), Infinitus 

($3.9 billion), Mary Kay ($3.7 billion), 

Perfect ($3.6 billion), Natura ($2.4 

billion), Tupperware ($2.3 billion), and 

Nu Skin ($2.3 billion). Avon’s figure here 

does not include Avon North America’s 

(a.k.a. “New Avon”) figure as this unit 

was sold to form an entity outside Avon. 

New Avon’s 2015 revenue was $1 billion.

WFDSA (World Federation of Direct 

Selling Associations) reports the sales 

volume generated in 2015 by its member 

countries as $184 billion and the number 

of individual direct sellers as 103 million. 

The number of direct sellers does not 

include those in China as this country’s 

figures were not reported. The sales 

volume in 2015 represents a 7.7% growth 

from the previous year in constant Dollars.

Amway kept its leadership position 

among direct selling companies in 2015. 

Amway’s 2015 global sales was $9.5 



31

C. Household Consumption

Global household consumption exceeds 

USD 45 trillion. Step by step and country 

by country Fluz Fluz is aiming at a piece 

of this amount. The United States, our 

next target consumer market currently 

averages >13 trillion in yearly household 

consumption currently.

Household Consumption reached USD 

177bn in 2016 in Colombia. We have 

chosen to test Fluz Fluz in Colombia first,

because of the country’s stable economy 

and large development opportunities. 

Culturally, it has a history of companies 

engaging in multi-level and direct selling 

growth strategies, which are both similar 

and different to the Fluz Fluz model.

The appeal of Fluz Fluz lies in its fast 

processing, which will appeal to the 

money-conscious mobile users in Latin 

America. Fluz Fluz is an ideal fit because 

it resembles loyalty programs and retail 

shopping models that Colombians are 

already comfortable with. In 2017 Fluz 

Fluz has seen great consumer traction 

in Colombia and is now looking ready to 

enter the US consumer market. 

Although competitive in terms of existing 

retail loyalty programs and gift card 

exchanges, the US consumer has yet to 

enjoy the unique benefits offered from 

the Fluz Fluz model. The US consumer 

moreover has the purchasing power and 

the technological readiness needed to

fully grasp the benefits of Fluz Fluz. It is 

only logical to assume that if an emerging 

market like Colombia embraced the 

model in a landslight, so will a mature 

Ecommerce economy like the US.



32

Selection of Current Merchant 

Assortment

The Fluz Fluz merchant assortment 

responds to the needs and purchasing 

trends of the region to strategically 

partner with offline and online retailers. 

Fluz Fluz already has gift card purchasing

agreements with a large number of 

retailers from different categories in 

its initial market in Colombia. For the 

US market, the same methodology for 

merchant onboarding would be applied.

1. Fluz Fluz generates recurrent revenue 

for the retailers on a lower cost basis 

compared to other online sales channels 

(compare with high discount Groupon 

type models).

3. Fluz Fluz attracts new customers to 

retailers showcased on the Fluz Fluz site.

2. The incentive cost for the channel from 

the retailer’s perspective is wrapped 

up in Fluz points and not as face value 

discounts which preserves the retailer’s 

brand image.

4. Fluz Fluz works as an outsourced 

loyalty program for many retailers.

The key reasons why retailers are attracted to the Fluz Fluz model and acknowledge 

the WIN-WIN situation are:

FLUZ FLUZ



35

Apart from digital gift code merchants, 

Fluz Fluz has already partnered with 

gatekeeping financial processing 

institutions in Colombia. In Colombia, 

Credibanco and Redeban historically 

share access to hundreds of thousands 

of retail dataphones.

Fluz Fluz has become a strategic partner 

of these gatekeeper institutions in the 

management and commercialization of 

digital gift codes. 

Fluz Fluz also provides an attractive 

platform for retail banks to acquire and 

activate customers.



36

How does Fluz Fluz grow?

Fluz Fluz offers two forms of Fluzzer 

onboarding:

1. Through direct invitation into a specific 

Fluzzer´s network either via email or 

personal reference code. This is the 

classic form for Fluzzers to organically 

grow their network of friends and close 

social circle by being able to control who 

is invited in their particular downstream 

network.

2. Fluzzers who do not disable the 

function of auto network-fill can benefit 

from the automatic horizontal network 

fill mechanism. Unrelated and uninvited 

Fluzzer candidates can just download 

the Fluz app and are then automatically 

allocated into the next available seat in 

the overall network. The auto-fill works 

with a horizontal priority (opposed to 

a vertical fill), guaranteeing a smooth 

growth and extension of the network, 

without favouring particular parts of the 

network over others. This is particularly 

interesting for early Tokenholders 

who would directly benefit from this 

mechanism.

Our Business Model

The Network Model

of anyone else in their extended network. 

This allows members to potentially 

earn several thousands of dollars per 

month depending on network size and 

consumption level as well as type of 

digital codes bought.

Because members earn points for their 

friends’ purchases, they act as our 

biggest advocates. Members want their 

friends to make purchases through the 

network to increase their own payout.

B2C

Peer to Peer marketing

In our marketplace, a portion of the 

revenue is reinvested with the members 

in the form of payouts. Fluz Fluz has an 

advanced network model to determine 

a payout structure for each member. 

The invite-only process forces each new 

member to be entered within the network 

of a pre-existing Fluzzer while establishing 

a sense of trust for the marketplace. Each 

member can earn rebate payments for 

their purchases as well as the purchases 



37

Cash back network & pay out structure

We want to be very transparent with this 

essential part of the value proposition. 

Fluz Fluz works under the following 

mechanism: Each digital retail code 

purchase generates Fluz points for 

the purchaser and up to 15 upstream 

Fluzzers in his/her direct line.

As we can observe in the table and 

graphics above, Fluz Fluz was set up as 

a binary network with a total depth of 16 

levels contributing to each Fluzzer. Each 

Fluzzer has the full potential to build 

a 2^16 consumer network, resulting 

in 65,535 consumers plus oneself to 

generate cash back rewards from their 

daily consumption. This structure was 

carefully chosen to foster teamwork 

among the network members and 

avoid as much competition as possible 

amongst the closest social circle working 

with a 3^X, 4^X, etc structures.

From 100% of the cash back amount 

available from an individual purchase, 

50% goes to the purchasers in the form 

of Fluz points (i.e Fluz consumption 

coins for the US launch),50% are split up 

evenly among the participating upstream 

Fluzzers and 10% are distributed to 

superpower accounts linked to FLUZ 

tokens. So, in the normal case the 50% 

will be divided between 15 upstream 

Fluzzers.

This split guarantees a significant 

incentive for consumption (what do I 

get back from what I purchase) whereas 

at the same time it incentivizes the 

construction of consumer network. 

Earned Fluz points from one’s own 

purchases and the purchases of other 

Fluzzers in the network accumulates in 

real-time to the Fluz balance. Fluz points 

can currently be used in real-time for 

the purchases of new retail codes or 

be cashed-out into FIAT currency bank 

accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.

Purchases with Fluz points also generate 

new points, a major differentiator from 

other loyalty programs. It is also possible 

to purchase a retail code partially with 

Fluz points and cover the remaining 

amount with other payment methods.

SUM

to recover during the 2nd month. If the 

minimum consumption is not met at the 

end of the 2nd month the network will 

automatically suspend the consumer 

from being able to purchase and receive 

further Fluz points from his/her network. 

The Fluzzer may request a re-invite at 

any given moment and will at no times 

loose his accumulated Fluz points. If the 

re-invite is accepted, so is the consumer. 

But he/she will lose original network 

seat membership and be placed into 

the next free seat by normal upstream 

succession. This in turn signifies that 

the free network seat is occupied by the 

next level of the downstream network. If 

there are 2 active members, the system 

automatically allocates the freed network 

seat to the Fluzzer of the 2 direct downline 

members who has a higher total historic 

transaction volume history on Fluz Fluz. 

In this regard, Fluz Fluz stays coherent 

in rewarding consumption. The entire 

affected part of the network is moved in 

succession closing all free upline seats.

Through this mechanism, active Fluzzers 

may eventually improve their absolute 

network seat. The above mentioned 

mechanisms are already in place and 

working properly in the Colombian

consumer network.

Minimum consumption: A simple rule

Fluz Fluz is based on consumer 

reciprocity. The consumer who 

contributes with his her consumption, 

receives cash back Fluz points from the

purchases of others. The consumer 

who does not purchase on his/her own 

behalf, cannot expect to receive cash 

back Fluz points from the consumption 

of his network.

Hence, the minimum consumption rule 

states that in order to stay active in the 

consumer network, a consumer needs to 

purchase at least 2 digital gift cards from 

the offered catalogue per month. There is 

no requirement as to which digital gift or 

which amount. This yields no burden on 

the consumer or consumption restriction 

given the broad variety of everyday 

household consumption merchants.

In turn this rule guarantees an active and 

contributing consumer network.

Premier Seats 1 and 2, offered in this 

tokensale, enjoy an initial exemption 

from this rule making them attractive 

for anyone to buy even those living and 

consuming

in a region where Fluz Fluz is currently 

inactive. Based on the minimum 

consumption rule and if within the first 

month the consumption is not done, the 

Fluzzer receives alerts and the chance 



39

How much money can a Fluzzer make?

Taking into account the mechanisms 

outlined, the answer to this pressing 

question is: it depends.

And precisely it depends on these 

factors:

1) Amount of my consumption - how 

much do I and my downstream network 

consume?

2) % of network payout of the consumption 

- where do I and my network consume, at 

what retailers?

3) Size of  my downstream - How many 

Fluzzers are in my network contributing 

through their consumption?

From the above logic it becomes clear 

that for a sustainable and dynamic 

network there cannot be a rigid 

compensation plan as in traditional 

MLM models. Precisely because in the 

Fluz Fluz model everyone wins, and the 

cash back amounts differ for every retail 

code. It is understandable that retail 

margins and code denominations vary 

from category to category and Fluz Fluz 

manages different retail negotiations 

with its partners. From there, different 

cash back amounts can be redistributed 

to the network. The cash back amounts 

are transparently shown to the purchaser 

before concluding the transaction.

The network activity feed shows the 

Fluzzer exactly how many Fluz points 

were earned from every purchase and 

Fluzzer in the individual network.

With the combinations of 1), 2) and 3) it 

is clear that there can be infinite payout 

combinations. Fluz Fluz invites every 

Fluzzer to make her/his own estimations 

and calculations. Either through a small 

network of high spenders or a large 

network of lows spenders, attractive 

monthly cash back rewards can amount. 

Ideally, you would have a large network 

of Fluzzers spending as much as possible 

of their household consumption via Fluz 

Fluz through the already numerous and 

constantly growing retail redemption 

options!



40

Within Fluz Fluz, we envision the network 

as a circle, in which each Fluzzer is the 

core of his or her network and can accrue 

Fluz points based on his/ her friends and 

their own purchases.

Additionally, Fluzzers can interact with 

others in their network via an internal 

messaging system or by hosting meetups. 

There’s a side leaderboard which shows 

monthly winners in different categories 

and inspires a little friendly competition 

between members.

The projected member growth curve follows a typical exponential curve, where after a while 

with the business model entrenching into the shopping culture, the virality of the model 

kicks in fully.

3. Diversity of categories

Telecommunications (phone cards, 

phone plans), Food and Beverage Retail 

Industry (supermarkets, restaurants, 

food and beverage vendors), and 

Consumer Goods (pharmaceuticals, 

household items, apparel) are primary 

categories for Fluz Fluz. Additionally, 

Fluz Fluz has travel services in Colombia. 

We currently see the highest percentage 

of our sales in everyday purchases-- i.e. 

food, gasoline, convenience, as well as

Competition

Fluz Fluz are reaped from consumption 

on the app. Fluz Fluz is a consumer 

network where Fluzzers are incentivized

to invite friends so they can earn 

points and cash out later. Corporations 

are incentivized to use the network 

because we make it easier to take care 

of their payroll and benefits. Fluz Fluz 

employs MLM techniques but is not an 

MLM company. We have adapted this 

business model and utilize it as a vehicle 

for efficient member growth keeping 

long-term CAC low.

MLM Companies

How does Fluz Fluz compare and differ 

from MLM companies?

Fluz Fluz has many key distinctions 

from MLM companies. Unlike many 

direct-selling companies that employ 

MLM techniques, Fluz Fluz does not 

sell products. Instead, Fluz Fluz offers 

an array of services for corporations 

that want to transfer digital gift cards to 

consumers. 

Secondly, unlike other MLM companies, 

there is no membership fee, nor are there 

rewards for mere invitations. Rewards on

Who are our customers?

As noted, our target customers want to 

pull more money out of their everyday 

purchases. They are budget conscious 

and looking to leverage their purchasing 

power.

Fluz Fluz implements a binary model, 

where every network member invites two 

new members in his/ her downstream. 

These two members will invite two new 

members respectively. Given the limited 

width of our network, our members will 

choose the friends in their network very 

carefully. 

• Our target customer/target network 

includes:

• Heads of households looking to 

optimize their family budget

•  Budget-conscious consumers looking 

to leverage purchasing power

•  Moderately social consumers with a few 

friends in their close circle of influence

•  Consumers looking for real time savings 

based on their current location.

Marketing & User Journey

How does Fluz Fluz Increase 

Engagement?

Long term: Main way: social component

Short term: Cross-channel marketing 

plan (online and offline) for Brand-

building.

The following channels will be worked 

on with tight performance measures:

• ATL Campaigns (TV, Radio, Print)

• Offline Events

• PR Campaigns

• Online Advertising (Display, SEM)

• Fluz Free Credits

• Outbound CallsWith a strong, initial marketing campaign 

the Fluz Fluzmodel should become 

massive and obtain the necessary share 

of mind of the consumer.



45

Community Marketing

• The social sharing component is built 

to increase member engagement.

• As demonstrated by Facebook’s social 

advertising model, reinforcing members 

whose inner circle made a purchase 

will increase conversions on first time 

purchases. If a friend made the purchase 

from a merchant, it will validate the 

merchant to the member who may have 

never heard of them.

• Our ecosystem recommends merchants

based on the fact that people in their 

network made purchases from those 

merchants. When recommending, the 

Fluz Fluz app displays the friend who 

made the purchase. In the newsfeed, 

Fluzzers can see how many points, 

members earn from their inner network.

• Fluz Fluz also provides a built-in 

messaging system for members to talk 

amongst themselves to drive purchases 

and contribute to purchase patterns.”

Event Marketing and

Offline Component 

• Fluz Fluz is working to turn our 

customers into leaders. Be it a social 

media campaign on their own accounts 

or hosting meetups, Fluz Fluz empowers 

our members to become an advocate 

for their network. By increasing the 

purchases of their network, that in turn 

drives more reward payouts for these 

members.

• Fluz Fluz is digitizing multilayer 

business strategies by using this 

extended network. One of these methods 

is the organization of regular, local 

meet-ups where Fluzzers can interact 

and attract new members. These events 

may be held by experienced Fluz Fluz 

members and employees to present our 

value proposition to new and potential 

members. This should permit us to grow 

our member base at an enormous speed.

• The physical meet-up strategy is 

complemented by frequent Instagram 

Live and other efficient Webinar tools for 

mass education of new Fluzzers.



46

in comparison to others in their social 

network and Fluz Fluz can promote 

certain spending behaviors by tapping 

into this phenomenon. For example, 

NikeFuel was able to gamify running by 

letting runners earn trophies for goals 

met and allowing them to post results on 

social media. Nike saw a 30% increase in 

revenue as a result of the app. DevHub, an 

online project completion website for web 

developers was able to raise various enga-

gement metric by 20% using gamification. 

Forbes reported that user completion of 

projects went from 10% to 80% as a result 

of badges on Devhub.

• Fluzzers can gain access to their status in 

the program’s leaderboard, which will have 

monthly competitions based on number 

of transactions, biggest purchasers and 

other achievements. There will be different 

categories like biggest buyer in terms 

of COP, biggest buyer in terms of units, 

biggest buyer in terms of transactions, 

and best brand ambassador in terms of 

number of meetups hosted.

• The prizes would include free gift cards 

from our affiliate network, Fluz points in 

account, or a paid destination trip.

• The prize giveaways would function 

to incentivize member spending so that 

they can win in friendly competitions 

with their friends for prizes.

Gamification & Prize Contests

• Fluz Fluz is looking to capitalize on the 

global trend of Gamification with Fluz 

Fluz. The idea of online games and friendly 

competition works well with the Fluz Fluz 

network model. People should instead 

of will spurred to make more purchases 

as a result of being able to interact with 

their network. There is a global trend in 

gamification, in which companies are 

able to generate buzz, retain customer 

interest, and develop customer loyalty 

by spurring competition. Gamification is 

the application of game design thinking 

to non-game applications to make them 

more fun and interesting. Demand for 

gamification in business is spurred 

by the social trend of the “Quantified 

Self”, a term coined by Wired writers 

Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007 to 

describe the growing Gamification & 

Prize Contestsinterest in self-tracking. 

People want to know where they stand 



47

How do new Fluzzers apply and get

onboard? How do they use Fluz Fluz?

Exemplary pitch to consumers / User 

Journey:

• After someone invites you, you sign up 

with your ID details. After clicking on a 

confirmation email, you are officially a 

Fluzzer! You can start making money on 

every purchase.

• Assuming you meet the minimum 

requirements of two gift card purchases 

a month, you can continue to use the 

Fluz Fluz application and accrue points. 

If you want to earn even more points, you 

can invite two other people to become 

Fluz Fluz members and you get points 

when they spend! 

• If you wish to increase your involvement 

and make even more money, you can 

become a brand ambassador and host 

meetups. Meetups provide chances to 

teach people in your extended network 

about Fluz Fluz. In addition, you can 

enjoy perks like free merchandise from 

our retailers, a free coffee and Fluz points! 

• You need to pay someone for the dinner 

last night. Want to save transaction 

costs? Just send him some Fluz.



48

We think the Fluz Fluz business model 

is ideally positioned to benefit from 

blockchain technology. Currently, the 

model is up and running in an offchain 

environment but may evolved to the 

blockchain technology simultaneously 

to the US consumer market launch in 

order to sustain scaling to a global 

enterprise.

Precisely these are eliminate the reasons 

instead of items to deploy blockchain 

now on our existing operating model: 

1. Code security is of the essence in 

a model based of digital gift cards. 

Experience of other digital gift card 

marketplaces have shown that hacking 

incidents, code redemption errors and 

fraudulent behaviour with regards to 

digital gift cards are rampant and difficult 

to contain in an Internet 2.0 environment. 

5 Yet with blockchain technology we 

créate a high standard of code security 

enabling merchants to directly upload 

digital codes and Fluzzers buying these

Technology & Blockchain
codes without the need to go through 

Fluz Fluz. Cutting out intermediaries 

should allow for safer and decentralized 

transactions.

We welcome and embrace ERC 20 

standard for the implementation of the 

Fluz Fluz global consumer network 

based on blockchain.

2. The complex consumer network 

information with cash back points 

accrual and the network positions 

and dependencies would be stored 

transparently in the blockchain. Thereby 

we guarantee that information on Fluz 

points and all movements (premier 

seats activations, network position 

successions etc) in the Fluz Fluz network 

may supervised by the blockchain 

community.

Sensitive personal data and gift codes 

keep being stored offchain.

3. Put into a robust blockchain model, 

tradable Fluz coins tradable Fluz coins 

would also be perfectly used to pay 

merchants and for merchants in turn to 

pay Fluz Fluz for anonymized consumer 

insight. Needless to say, Fluz Fluz will 

also accept digital retail codes payments



49

through cryptocurrencies as well as FIAT 

currencies and will allow redemption 

of accrued Fluz coins to the main 

cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Each user’s mobile wallet codes are 

also secured through best-in-class 

authorization steps.

Our existing app is easy to use on-the-

go, buying a gift card to redeem instantly 

while waiting in line at the supermarket 

for instance.

The system is built to automatically 

process reward distribution configurable 

for each product, transform gift cards 

into different formats (bar code, QR 

code) send out consumption reminders, 

member deletions and so-called 

successions in the network, and many 

more custom features not available 

on any off-the-shelf solution.

Redemption Hardware at POS

Key to the current Fluz Fluz 

user experience is the seamless 

redemption process at POS. Despite 

the fact that we have knitted close 

ties to dataphone processors, on 

some retail store locations Fluz Fluz 

does not yet control the end to end 

redemption experience.

Tier 1 are for 12 months after the 

operational US launch exempt from 

general member minimum consumption 

rule.  The company may request then 

one annual purchase of USD 10.

Fluz Fluz will create blocked premier 

seats membership in all theoretical 

combinations of outstanding Tier 1 and 

Tier 2 premier memberships tokens held 

after the Token sale by the market.

Effective Premier Seat Allocation 

Mechanism after Token Sale

It is proposed that 30 days before the 

operational Fluz Fluz launch in the 

United States and thereby the launch of 

the global consumer network, qualifying 

token holders will be able to activate

Community superpower utility of 

FLUZ tokens

Community building and consumption 

networking is at the core of the Fluz 

Fluz model. In order to further propel 

consumption team building, the 

attachment of FLUZ tokens to a Fluzzers´s 

account - premier seat or normal account 

membership - grant communication 

packages to the downstream network.

Our experience has shown that an 

active consumption motivation and 

communication can further boost cash 

back performance and cohesion.

1 Fluz token linked to an account grants 

the possibility to deliver 1 personalized 

message (previously verified for not 

containing inappropriate or offensive 

language) to a specific downstream 

network member per month.

With for example 65,535 FLUZ tokens 

attached to an account, the Fluzzer is able 

to communicate a 1 message per month 

to his/her total network if completed.

A premier seat member Tier 1 (Tier 2), 

is equipped from the start with a credit 

of 20.000 (10.000) messages to his/her 

consumption team.

When tokens are detached from an 

account, the unused community 

messaging credit is lost and not restored.

FLUZ tokenholders through the 

community superpower might also be 

eligible for other features within their 

network such as birthday FLUZ giftings, 

merchants suggestions voting system, 

special deal eligibility and others to 

enhance community consumption and 

strengthen their specific network. The 

details of these features shall be released 

during the implementation roadmap.

Use of Token sale Funds

As a consequence of the considerations 

made above, our business model 

requires capital to start operating in 

the US consumer market. The use of 

the procedes from the Tokensale are 

projected as follows for informative 

matters. To no extent does this 

illustrative use of proceeds suggest 

any conclusion towards the value 

of the token.

1. Do I have to live in Colombia or the 

US to join my premier network seat 

which I activated with the token I 

bought?

No. Premier  memberships and their future 

cash backs may enjoyed from anywhere 

in the world. Tier 1 Premier seats are 

exempt from minimum consumption for 

lifetime. This means that even though 

Fluz Fluz is not yet operating in your 

particular country with local retail 

redemption options, it is highly advisable 

to purchase Tokens now and become 

part of the earliest Fluzzers. Eliminate 

this sentence: Besides, your Fluz tokens 

without premier seat activation are likely 

to increase in value as the utilities of the 

token evolve in our gift card eco-system 

according to the de ned roadmap.

2. Can I look at your app?

Yes. The Fluz Fluz app is available on 

the Apple and Google stores and may be 

downloaded by anyone. We would like 

to point out that given our current focus 

on Colombia, the app is only available  in 

the Spanish language.

3. When and how will Tokens be 

distributed?

Tokens will be distributed to the 

tokenholder addresses within 5 

working days after the crowdsale end.

4. Which jurisdiction was chosen for 

this token sale?

The Fluz Fluz Tokensale will be launched 

from Gibraltar by Fluz Fluz (Gibraltar) Ltd 

and is therefore subject to Gibraltar law. 

We have been advised that the activity 

of the Fluz Fluz Token sale falls outside 

the scope of the existing regulatory 

framework in Gibraltar.

The Financial Services (Distributed 

Ledger Technology Providers) 

Regulations 2017 (the “DLT Regulations”) 

have recently been published and is 

due to take effect as of 1 January 2018 

and whilst these impending regulations 

FAQ



64

should not apply to token sale activity, the 

Gibraltar Financial Services Commission 

have recently announced that they are 

considering preparing complementary 

regulations that will be specifically aimed 

at initial coin offerings or similar token 

generating events. We will be monitoring 

the situation closely and endeavour to 

do whatever is required to be compliant 

with any regulations that may become 

applicable to Fluz Fluz (Gibraltar) Ltd in 

due course. Fluz Fluz Group may appoint 

one of its affiliated and/or subsidiary 

companies to act as collecting agent for 

token sales.

5. Can I submit BTC or ETH from an 

exchange account?

No. Exchanges send funds via multiple 

wallets that are not fully in your control. 

You don’t hold the private keys in many 

cases. When sending funds from an 

exchange the process can take hours 

to clear or even reach the blockchain. 

If sending ETH you are unable to add an 

ETH payload (sometimes called ‘data’) to 

a transaction. Once you submit through 

an exchange, you are also unable to 

modify the transaction fee to speed up a 

transaction. Please use a wallet that you 

are in full control of.

6. Which wallets can I use?

Please view the list below for compatible 

wallets. If you choose to purchase 

tokens with BTC, you can send BTC 

from an Exchange but need to provide 

us with a token receipt address that is 

ERC20 compatible (see the list of ERC20 

compatible wallet below). If you choose 

to purchase tokens with ETH, the ETH 

must be sent by an ERC20 compatible 

wallet. You must enter data input and gas 

limit values for a successful transaction.

The following wallets are known to 

be compatible with Ethereum tokens 

(ERC20 standard) and may allow you to 

receive and view your balances.

MyEtherWallet (no download needed), 

Mist (Desktop), Parity (Desktop), imToken 

(iPhone), imToken (Android)

Non ERC20 Compatible Wallets. Do not 

send ETH from these sources.

Any Bitcoin/Ethereum Exchange: 

Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitstamp, 

Bit nex, Bitrexx, Cex.io, Exodus



65

MyEtherWallet (no download needed), 

Mist (Desktop), Parity (Desktop), imToken 

(iPhone), imToken(Android)

3. Send a deposit to the payment address 

displayed through the token sale widget 

with correct data and gas limit values

Token sale deposit transactions need 

to have non-default gas limit (a.k.a. 

transaction maximum gas). This is 

because token sale transactions are more 

complex than simple Ethereum transfer 

transactions. The default gas limits is 

too low to correctly perform a token sale 

deposit.

To participate in an Ethereum token sale 

you need to do your transaction in with 

following details

1) Address - this is given you on the token 

sale payment information page.

2) Data - this is your personal reference 

number and it changes for every 

transaction. Do not share this with others. 

If you leave data eliminate eld than your 

transaction is rejected.

3) Gas limit: 250000 - gas tells that this is 

a smart contract transaction and is more 

expensive than normal Ether transfer.

7. I sent Ethereum from an exchange 

for the presale or token sale, what 

can I do?

The transaction will be returned because 

of no data  eld. If the funds do not show up 

in your exchange wallet please contact 

the exchange’s support with the details 

of your transaction to see if you can get 

credit back for the transaction.

8. Where can I purchase ETH?

There are many exchanges that sell 

Ethereum for  at or cryptocurrency, these 

include: Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, 

Bitstamp, Bit nex, Bittrex, Cex.io

Please send your purchased ETH to a 

compatible wallet whose private keys 

you own and control, before sending to 

the token sale.

9. Where can I purchase BTC?

There are many exchanges that sell 

Bitcoin for  at or cryptocurrency, these 

include: Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, 

Bitstamp, Bit nex, Bittrex, Cex.io

10. How to participate in the token 

sale with ETH?

1. Buy ETH on a cryptocurrency 

exchange, unless already owned.

2. Transfer ETH to a compatible wallet 

(see below)



66

Note: For any wallet always check your 

gas limit If you are using MyEtherWallet.

to an invalid number after inputting 

the data  field.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider and 

evaluate each of the following risk factors 

and all other information contained 

in these Terms before deciding to 

participate in the Token Sale. To the best 

of the Company’s knowledge and belief, 

all risk factors which are material to 

you in making an informed judgment to 

participate in the Token Sale have been 

set out below. If any of the following 

considerations, uncertainties or material 

risks develops into actual events, the 

business, financial position and/or 

results of operations of the Company 

and the maintenance and level of usage 

of the Tokens could be materially and 

adversely affected. In such cases, the 

trading price of Tokens (in the case 

where they are listed on an exchange or 

market (regulated, unregulated, primary, 

secondary or otherwise)) could decline 

due to any of these considerations, 



76

uncertainties or material risks, and you 

may lose all or part of your Tokens or the 

economic value thereof.

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION

IN THE TOKEN SALE

There is no prior market for Tokens 

and the Token Sale may not result in an 

active or liquid market for the Tokens. 

Prior to the Token Sale, there has been no 

public market for the Tokens. In the event 

that the Company ever decides to seek 

the approval for availability of the Tokens 

for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange 

or market, there is no assurance that such 

approval will be obtained. Furthermore, 

even if such approval is granted by a 

cryptocurrency exchange, there is no 

assurance that an active or liquid trading 

market for the Tokens will develop, or if 

developed, will be sustained after the 

Tokens have been made available for 

trading on such market. There is also 

no assurance that the market price of 

the Tokens will not decline below the 

original or issue purchase price (the 

“Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price 

may not be indicative of the market price 

of the Tokens after they have been made 

available for trading on a market. 

A Token is not a currency issued by any 

central bank or national, supra-national 

or quasi-national organisation, nor is it 

backed by any hard assets or other credit 

nor is it a commodity in the traditional 

sense of that word. The Company is 

not responsible for, nor does it pursue, 

the circulation and trading of Tokens 

on any market. Trading of Tokens will 

merely depend on the consensus on 

its value between the relevant market 

participants. No one is obliged to 

purchase any Token from any holder of 

the Token, including the purchasers, nor 

does anyone guarantee the liquidity or 

market price of Tokens to any extent at 

any time. Furthermore, Tokens may not 

be resold to purchasers who are citizens, 

nationals, residents (tax or otherwise) 

and/or green card holders of Restricted 

Jurisdictions or to Restricted Persons or 

to purchasers in any other jurisdiction 

where the purchase of Tokens may be in 

violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, 

the Company cannot ensure that there 

will be any demand or market for Tokens, 

or that the Purchase Price is indicative 

of the market price of Tokens after they 

have been made available for trading on 

any cryptocurrency exchange or market. 



77

Future sales or issuance of the Tokens 

could materially and adversely affect 

the market price of Tokens. 

Any future sale or issuance of the Tokens 

would increase the supply of Tokens 

in the market and this may result in a 

downward price pressure on the Token. 

The sale or distribution of a significant 

number of Tokens outside of the Token 

Sale (including but not limited to the 

sales of Tokens undertaken after the 

completion of the initial crowdsale, 

issuance of Tokens to persons other 

than purchasers for purposes of 

community initiatives, business 

development, academic research, 

education and market expansion and 

issuance of Tokens as a reward to users 

of the Company’s business platform that 

is yet to be developed or otherwise), 

or the perception that such further sales 

or issuance may occur, could adversely 

affect the trading price of the Tokens. 

Negative publicity may materially 

and adversely affect the price of 

the Tokens. 

Negative publicity involving the 

Company, the Tokens or any of the 

key personnel of the Company and/

or regulation of distributed ledger 

technologies, cryptocurrencies and/or 

crowdsales of tokens in any jurisdiction, 

may materially and adversely affect the 

market perception or market price of the 

Tokens, whether or not it is justified.

The Company may not be able to pay 

any anticipated rewards in the future. 

There is no assurance that there will be 

sufficient engagement in the Company’s 

business platform that is yet to be 

developed such that you will receive any 

rewards anticipated to be distributed to 

active users of the Company’s business 

platform. Further, even in the event 

there is substantial engagement and 

interactions among the users of the 

Company’s business platform that is yet 

to be developed, there is no assurance 

you personally will receive any part of 

the rewards. This is because the ability 

of the Company to pay any reward to 

you will depend on the future results of 

operations and the future business and 

financial condition of the Company, and 

there is no assurance of the future results 

of operations and the future business 



78

and financial condition of the Company.

There is no assurance of any success 

of the Company’s Token Sale or 

business platform that is yet to be 

developed as envisaged by the 

Available Information. 

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens 

hinges heavily on the performance of 

the Company’s Token Sale and business 

platform that is yet to be developed and 

the continuous active engagement of its 

users and success of its contemplated 

business lines. There is no assurance 

that the Company’s Token Sale will be 

successful or that its business platform 

that is yet to be developed will gain or 

continue to gain traction. While the 

Company has made every effort to 

provide a realistic estimate, there is also 

no assurance that the cryptocurrencies 

raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient 

for the development of the Company’s 

business platform. For the foregoing or 

any other reason, the development of the 

Company’s business platform and launch 

of the anticipated Token functionality 

may not be completed and there is no 

assurance that it will be launched at all. 

As such, distributed Tokens may hold 

little or no worth or value and this would 

impact any trading price and/or use of 

the Tokens.

The trading price of the Tokens may 

fluctuate following the Token Sale.

The prices of cryptographic tokens in 

general tend to be relatively volatile, 

and can fluctuate significantly over short 

periods of time. The demand for, and 

the corresponding market price of, the 

Tokens may fluctuate significantly and 

rapidly in response to, among others, 

the following factors, some of which are 

beyond the control of the Company:

 (a) new technical innovations;

 (b) analysts’ speculations, 

recommendations, perceptions or 

estimates of the Token’s market price or 

the Company’s financial and business 

performance;

 (c) changes in market valuations 

and token prices of entities with 

businesses similar to that of the 

Company that may be listed on the same 

cryptocurrency exchanges or markets as 

the Tokens; 

 (d) announcements by the 



79

Company of significant events, for 

example partnerships, sponsorships or 

new product developments; 

 (e) fluctuations in market prices 

and trading volume of cryptocurrencies 

on cryptocurrency exchanges or markets; 

 (f) additions or departures of key 

personnel of the Company;

 (g) success or failure of the 

Company’s management in implementing 

business and growth strategies; and/or

 (h) changes in conditions affecting 

the blockchain or financial technology 

industry, the general economic 

conditions or market sentiments, or other 

events or factors.

The funds raised in the Token Sale are 

exposed to risks of theft. 

The Company will make every effort 

to ensure that the funds received from 

the Token Sale will be securely held. 

Further, the Company may make every 

effort to ensure that the funds received 

by it from Token Sale will be securely 

held through the implementation of 

security measures. Notwithstanding 

such security measures, there is no 

assurance that there will be no theft of 

the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, 

sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed 

denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities 

or defects on the Token Sale website, in 

the smart contract(s) on which the Token 

Sale relies, on the Ethereum blockchain 

or any other blockchain, or otherwise. 

Such events may include, for example, 

flaws in programming or source code 

leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. 

In such event, even if the Token Sale is 

completed, the Company may not be 

able to receive the cryptocurrencies 

raised and the Company may not be able 

to use such funds for the development 

of the Company’s business platform. In 

such case, the launch of the Company’s 

business platform might be temporarily 

or permanently curtailed. As such, 

distributed Tokens may hold little worth 

or value and this would impact their 

trading price.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY 

The Company’s business platform that 

is yet to be developed. 

Any events or circumstances which 

adversely affect the Company or any of its 

successor or affiliated operating entities 

may have a corresponding adverse effect 

on the Company’s business platform that 

is yet to be developed, including but not 



80

limited to the development, structuring 

and launch of the Company’s business 

platform. Such adverse effects would 

correspondingly have an impact on the 

utility, liquidity, and the trading price of 

the Tokens. 

The Company may be materially 

and adversely affected if it fails to 

effectively manage its operations as 

its business develops and evolves, 

which would have a direct impact on its 

ability to develop, maintain or operate 

the Company’s business platform and/

or develop, structure and/or licence 

any Token functionality.

The financial technology and 

cryptocurrency industries in which the 

Company competes have grown rapidly 

over the past few years and continue to 

evolve in response to new technological 

advances, changing business models, 

shifting regulations and other factors.  

As a result of this constantly changing 

environment, the Company may face 

operational difficulties in adjusting 

to the changes, and the sustainability 

of the Company will depend on its 

ability to manage its operations, ensure 

that it hires qualified and competent 

employees, and provides proper training 

for its personnel. As its business evolves, 

the Company must also expand and 

adapt its operational infrastructure. The 

Company’s business will in part rely on 

its blockchain-based software systems, 

cryptocurrency wallets or other related 

token storage mechanisms, blockchain 

technology and smart contract 

technology. All of these systems, 

tools, and skillsets represent complex, 

costly, and rapidly changing technical 

infrastructure. In order to demonstrate 

continued ability to effectively manage 

technical support infrastructure for the 

Company’s business platform that is yet to 

be developed and the future functionality 

of the Tokens, the Company will need 

to continue to upgrade and improve 

its data systems and other operational 

systems, procedures, and controls. 

These upgrades and improvements will 

require a dedication of resources and 

are likely to be complex and increasingly 

rely on hosted computer services from 

third parties that the Company does 

not or will not control. If the Company 

is unable to adapt its systems and 

organisation in a timely, efficient, and 



81

cost-effective manner to accommodate 

changing circumstances, its business, 

financial condition and/or results of 

operations may be adversely affected. 

If the third parties whom the Company 

relies on are subject to a security breach 

or otherwise suffer disruptions that 

impact the services the Company uses, 

the integrity and availability of its internal 

information could be compromised, 

which may consequently cause the 

loss of confidential or proprietary 

information and/or economic loss. 

The loss of financial, labour or other 

resources, and any other adverse effect 

on the Company’s business, financial 

condition and/or operations, would have 

a direct adverse effect on the Company’s 

ability to develop maintain or operate 

the Company’s business platform 

and/or to develop, structure and/or 

license the anticipated Token 

functionality. Any adverse effects 

affecting the Company business or 

technology are likely to also adversely 

impact the utility, liquidity, and trading 

price of the Tokens.

The Company may experience system 

failures, unplanned interruptions in 

its network or services, hardware or 

software defects, security breaches 

or other causes that could adversely 

affect the Company’s infrastructure 

network, and/or the Company’s 

business platform that is yet to be 

developed.

The Company is not able to anticipate 

when there would be occurrences of 

hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials 

of service or errors, vulnerabilities or 

defects in: the Company’s business 

platform that is yet to be developed, in the 

smart contracts on which the Company 

or the Company’s business platform 

relies, or on the Ethereum or any other 

blockchain. Such events may include, 

for example, flaws in programming or 

source code leading to exploitation or 

abuse thereof. The Company may not be 

able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, 

distributed denials of service errors 

vulnerabilities or defects in a timely 

manner, and may not have sufficient 

resources to efficiently cope with 

multiple service incidents happening 

simultaneously or in rapid succession.

The Company’s network or services, 

which would include the Company’s 

business platform that is yet to be 

developed and, if successfully structured, 



82

developed, licensed and launched, the 

Token functionality, could be disrupted 

by numerous events, including natural 

disasters, equipment breakdown, 

network connectivity downtime, power 

losses, or even intentional disruptions 

of its services, such as disruptions 

caused by software viruses or attacks by 

unauthorized users, some of which are 

beyond the Company’s control. There 

can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, 

such as distributed denials of service, 

will not be attempted in the future or that 

the Company’s security measures will be 

effective. The Company may be prone to 

attacks on its infrastructure intended to 

steal information about its technology, 

financial data or user information or take 

other actions that would be damaging 

to the Company and/or holders of the 

Tokens. Any significant breach of the 

Company’s security measures or other 

disruptions resulting in a compromise 

of the usability, stability, and security of 

the Company’s business platform that is 

yet to be developed may adversely affect 

the utility, liquidity and/or trading price 

of the Tokens. 

The Company may in the future be 

dependent in part on the location and 

data centre facilities of third parties. 

The Company’s future infrastructure 

network may be established in whole 

or in part through servers which it owns 

and/or houses at the location facilities of 

third parties, and/or servers that it rents 

at data centre facilities of third parties. 

If the Company is unable to renew its 

data facility leases on commercially 

reasonable terms or at all, the Company 

may be required to transfer its servers 

to a new data centre facility, and may 

incur significant costs and possible 

service interruption in connection with 

the relocation. These facilities are also 

vulnerable to damage or interruption 

from, among others, natural disasters, 

arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, 

and telecommunication failures.

Additionally, the third-party providers 

of such facilities may suffer a breach 

of security as a result of third-party 

action, employee error, malfeasance 

or otherwise, and a third party may 

obtain unauthorised access to the data 

in such servers. The Company and 

the providers of such facilities may be 

unable to anticipate these techniques 

or to implement adequate preventive 

measures.



83

General global market and economic 

conditions may have an adverse 

impact on the Company’s operating 

performance, results of operations 

and/or cash flows. 

The Company could continue to be 

affected by general global economic 

and market conditions. Challenging 

economic conditions worldwide have 

from time to time, contributed, and may 

continue to contribute, to slowdowns 

in the information technology industry 

at large. Weakness in the economy 

could have a negative effect on the 

Company’s business, operations and 

financial condition, including decreases 

in revenue and operating cash flows, 

and inability to attract future equity 

and/or debt financing on commercially 

reasonable terms. Additionally, in a 

down-cycle economic environment, 

the Company may experience the 

negative effects of a slowdown in trading 

and usage of the Company’s business 

platform that is yet to be developed and 

may delay or cancel the development, 

structuring, licensing and/or launch of 

the anticipated Token functionality. 

Suppliers on which the Company relies 

for servers, bandwidth, location and 

other services could also be negatively 

impacted by economic conditions that, 

in turn, could have a negative impact on 

the Company’s operations or expenses. 

There can be no assurance, therefore, 

that current economic conditions or 

worsening economic conditions or a 

prolonged or recurring recession will 

not have a significant, adverse impact 

on the Company’s business, financial 

condition and results of operations, and 

hence, the Company’s business platform 

that is yet to be developed and/or the 

ability to develop, structure, license 

and/or launch any Token functionality. 

Any such circumstances would then 

correspondingly negatively impact the 

utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of 

the Tokens.

The Company or the Tokens may 

be affected by newly implemented 

regulations. 

Distributed ledger technologies, 

businesses and activities as well as 

cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-

related businesses and activities are 

generally unregulated worldwide, but 

numerous regulatory authorities across 

jurisdictions have been outspoken 

about considering the implementation 



84

of regulatory regimes which govern 

distributed ledger technologies, 

businesses and activities as well as 

cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-

related businesses and activities. 

The Company or the Tokens may 

be affected by newly implemented 

regulations relating to distributed 

ledger technologies, businesses and 

activities as well as cryptocurrencies 

and cryptocurrency-related businesses 

and activities, including having to 

take measures to comply with such 

regulations, or having to deal with 

queries, notices, requests or enforcement 

actions by regulatory authorities, which 

may come at a substantial cost and may 

also require substantial modifications 

to the Company’s business platform 

that is yet to be developed and/or the 

anticipated Token functionality. This 

may impact the appeal or practicality or 

functionality of the Company’s business 

platform that is yet to be developed and/

or the anticipated Token functionality for 

users and result in decreased usage of 

and demand for the Company’s business 

platform and the Tokens. Further, should 

the costs (financial or otherwise) of 

complying with such newly implemented 

regulations exceed a certain threshold, 

maintaining the Company’s business 

platform that is yet to be developed and/

or developing, structuring, licensing 

and/or launching the Token functionality 

may no longer be commercially viable, 

and the Company may opt to discontinue 

the Company’s business platform 

that is yet to be developed and/or the 

anticipated Token functionality, and/

or the Tokens. Further, it is difficult to 

predict how or whether governments or 

regulatory authorities may implement 

any changes to laws and regulations 

affecting distributed ledger technology 

and its applications, including the 

Company’s business platform that is yet 

to be developed and/or the anticipated 

Token functionality, and/or the Tokens.

The Company may also have to cease 

operations in a jurisdiction that makes 

it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, 

or make it commercially unviable or 

undesirable to obtain the necessary 

regulatory approval(s) to operate in such 

jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the 

foregoing, the utility, liquidity, and/or 

trading price of Tokens will be adversely 

affected and/or Tokens may cease to be 

traded.



85

There may be unanticipated risks 

arising from the Tokens.

Cryptographic tokens such as the 

Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic 

technology. In addition to the risks 

included in the above discussion of risk 

factors, there are other risks associated 

with your purchase, holding, and use 

of the Tokens, including those that the 

Company cannot anticipate. Such risks 

may further appear as unanticipated 

variations or combinations of the risks 

discussed above.

PRIVACY POLICY

By purchasing Tokens, you agree to 

your personal data, (i.e., your e-mail 

address, name, address and other 

details personal to you) being processed 

by the Company for its business 

purposes or the purposes of building, 

promoting, and communicating (about) 

the Company’s business platform that 

is yet to be developed and the Tokens. 

The Company agrees to keep your email 

address and other personal data private 

and not share it with the public (e.g., by 

including it on any external lists or selling 

to any third parties).
