1.2 NOTABLE

ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE

01.     Over US$250m interested in funding rounds listed on our Online 

Investment Platform. 

02.     Built a portfolio and provided our investors with access  

to some of the most valuable companies in the Bitcoin and Blockchain 

sector including BitFinex, Kraken, BitStamp, ShapeShift, BitPay and over 

100 others. 

4.



03.     Co-invested in some of the very first token sales including MaidSafe, 

Storj, Ethereum, Factom and many others. 

5.

04.     Invested 7 years into building a suite of registrations, licenses, 

partners and acquisitions, including our registered securities business, 

BnkToTheFuture.com and our nominee company Bnk To The Future 

Capital SPC, a US broker dealer and the only alternative trading system we 

know of that is approved with  FINRA and the SEC for the secondary 

trading of private equity. 

05.     Built our compliance-driven global platform with international 

financial services and securities laws in mind integrated with over 20 

traditional currencies and 35 crypto-currencies.  

 



1.3 

THE NEXT 

CHALLENGE 

AHEAD

Our investors are demanding more and we have been working 

hard on the next phase of our company's growth. In 2018 we aim 

to launch our secondary market with a compliance-driven 

Blockchain-based trading platform for our primary market 

securities in FinTech, Bitcoin & Blockchain companies. 

We also aim to launch the 

BF Token to help us overcome 

some key operational 

challenges our industry is 

facing as we scale into 2018 

and open up certain activities 

of our platform to a wider 

audience.

This is why Bloomberg recently 

covered us as the NASDAQ for 

Bitcoin, Blockchain and FinTech 

companies as can be viewed here:

2.1 

IT STARTED 

IN 2010

In 2010, Bnk To The Future was one of the first organizations to 

break through the barriers and challenges surrounding 

compliance-driven methods of investing in private equity online. 

Prior to starting this mission, almost all investing in private equity 

was done offline by angel investors, friends, family, venture 

capitalists and later stage private equity houses. 

Several companies in the UK set about allowing investors to invest 

online in private equity the same year that Bitcoin was launched in 

2009. Bnk To The Future was one of those companies. This was 

considered a very strange business by regulators at the time, so in 

order to help build this new sector, several companies 

participating in the space joined forces and formed the UK 

CrowdFunding Association (UKCFA). Our CEO, Simon Dixon, was 

both a founding member and Director of the UKCFA. 

After several years a few of the member companies managed to 

launch under the supervision of the first regulator to issue a 

license for this industry — the UK Financial Conduct Authority 

(FCA). These registrations occurred either through full 

authorisation or via an appointed representative, we were one of 

the first few added to the FCA register.

2.2 
OUR HISTORY 
WITH BITCOIN

2.3
THE INVESTMENT
PLATFORM

In 2011, at the same time that 

Bitcoin was growing in popularity 

and the first Altcoins were being 

launched, our CEO, Simon Dixon, 

spoke at the world's very first 

Bitcoin conference in Europe. 

In
d

u
stry

 O
v
e

rv
ie

w
 &

 H
isto

ry

He also wrote what may have 

been the first published book to 

include the subject of Bitcoin,  

‘Bank To The Future: Protect Your 

Future Before Governments Go 

Bust’. Simon Dixon later became 

one of the first founding members 

and Directors of the UK Digital 

Currency Association (UKDCA). 

The term ‘Equity CrowdFunding’ was first popularised in the UK and UK 

regulators were the first to permit investing in private equity online. The 

problem was that it was only open to UK companies and UK investors.

ryAt BnkToTheFuture.com we were one of the minority believers in Bitcoin 

during the early days of the cryptocurrency sector, and were 

accustomed to the way that Bitcoin was designed — global transactions 

unrestricted by government borders. We wanted to use our platform to 

drive investment into a sector that was receiving very little investment 

from traditional players. Because the market was still small and niche at 

the time, we had to think beyond the UK borders to get the liquidity 

needed to grow the cryptocurrency sector. 
 

2.4 
TOKENS MOVED 
FASTER THAN 
REGULATORS

Equity CrowdFunding grew in the UK and later caught the attention of the United 

States as they set about lifting their previous restrictions in order to permit investing 

through the JOBS Act. This Act attempted to allow the general public to invest small 

sums of money into private equity and securities online rather than those options 

being permitted for  qualifying investors only. 

The JOBS Act took several years to come into existence, whilst in the meantime the 

very first token sales started to appear, whereby crypto project owners were raising 

funds by creating Altcoins and selling them to any person who wanted to purchase 

them using Bitcoin.

2.5
WE NEEDED
TO BE GLOBAL

As we witnessed and analyzed the impacts of the cryptocurrency market at the 

global scale, we decided that it was time to leave the UK, deregister with the FCA, 

and expand our corporate structure to foster a global company vision.

At the time, investing in Bitcoin companies was risky since the underlying  community 

was still very small. The mission could only be successful if we could engage the 

entire crypto community around the world rather than one jurisdiction. We decided 

that we wanted to support this niche sector exclusively, so we set about registering 

with the Cayman Island Monetary Authority (CIMA) and spared no cost or time 

setting up a multi-jurisdictional global online securities business. 

Later, the JOBS Act came into force and online investing continuously expanded as 

more countries adjusted to the new directive in order to allow for online investing to 

boom. 

2.6
THEN CAME ETHEREUM 

As the online investing sector was booming and Bitcoin value and 

adoption was growing, Ethereum set about completing a token sale. We 

were one of the first purchasers of the Ethereum token during the Initial 

Coin Offering (ICO).

rySeveral years later the ERC20 standard made it easy for anybody to 

create a token and the number one application for Ethereum smart 

contracts became token sales and ICO’s. Banks, governments and 

corporations all over the world started promoting Blockchain 

technology and despite every institution best efforts, Bitcoin became 

the highest performing digital currency for seven consecutive years out 

of the last eight with only one low performing year. 

2.7
THEN THE VC’S STARTED
TO PLAY

We were investing in the equity 

of many companies that at the 

time were too strange even for 

venture capitalists. In 2013, 

venture capital activity in our 

sector started to take off and 

we were able to co-invest in 

many of the largest Bitcoin 

companies with venture capital 

grade due diligence and open 

them up for co-investment on 

BnkToThefuture.com. 

We saw four booms over the 

years taking us into both a 

profitable growth company and 

an asset holding company, with 

beneficial interests in most of 

the companies that listed on 

our online investment platform. 

Those four investment booms 

were Bitcoin, Equity in 

Blockchain companies, Altcoins 

and Tokens (ICO’s).

INNOVATION & 
REGULATIONS

2.9
INNOVATION & 
REGULATIONS

Forward to 2017, within our niche sector of Bitcoin and Blockchain, 

investing in token sales started to overtake venture capital investing 

and regulators all around the world started to define their stance on 

the fast growing industry.

As token sales started to become more and more liquid, we started to 

see a major appetite from our investors to make their investments more 

liquid. As a result, we began exploring ways in which we might facilitate 

our investors to sell their private equity investments to one another with 

compliance in  mind. As we evaluated automating this process we 

realised that the regulatory challenges were huge. We also witnessed 

the ability for people to tokenize assets like venture capital and private 

equity, with many ignoring regulations all together as was the case with 

the infamous DAO tokens. 

We have been continuously innovating and adapting our platform to 

match the  challenges and updates of regulatory requirements, market 

needs and technological advancements in each jurisdiction as they 

unfold.

13.



We started the process of acquiring stakes in companies that had 

relevant securities licenses, including a FINRA registered broker dealer 

and the only Alternative Trading System (ATS) we knew about that was 

registered with the SEC, and had permission to provide a secondary 

market for private equity so we could partner with them in our growth. 

We also set about partnering with the only clearing firm we knew of that 

was authorised to clear Blockchain securities and crypto exchanges (that 

we were investors in) to help with liquidity.

2.10
REGULATORY 
CLARITY

Our original vision of an alternative financial system that operates 

independent of banks has become a reality and now we feel the 

regulatory environment is ready for us to launch our own token. We 

also feel the time is right to launch a compliance-driven secondary 

market for other securities tokens.

We decided to launch the BF Token before we launch our secondary 

market in 2018 to help us solve some of the major challenges we are 

facing as our industry scales and grows beyond anything our team 

can handle. We are now at the stage where the number of 

applications for investment on our platform is scaling way too fast 

for us to keep up with and we need the support of the community to 

scale BnkToTheFuture.com to reach its full potential in line with the 

industries growth.

Today the difference between utility tokens and securities is 

becoming clearer each day and the legal frameworks for investing 

online in products we support on our platform (including SAFT’s 

(Simple Agreement on Future Tokens), SAFE’s (Simple Agreement 

on Future Equity), Convertible Notes, Tokens, Funds and Equity) is 

validated the more regulators we engage with all over the world.

WE STILL REMAIN 
TRUE TO OUR ORIGINS

We still remember what it was 

like when nobody cared about 

Bitcoin, when no venture 

capitalist would look at a Bitcoin 

company, when the first venture 

capitalists started investing in 

Blockchain companies, when no 

regulator would look at such a 

business as ours, when the first 

Altcoins were launched, when the 

crypto markets started 

generating volume, when banks 

and corporations started trying to 

popularise Blockchain over 

Bitcoin, when ICO’s first started. 

WE LOOK BACK AT THE 

INDUSTRY TODAY AND 

ARE PROUD AT HOW 

MUCH IT HAS GROWN. WE 

HAVE A FULL TIME TEAM 

DEDICATED TO 

UNDERSTANDING THIS 

SECTOR AND STILL 

THINGS PASS US BY.

THE BF TOKEN MIGHT 
JUST BE THE ANSWER

We see our role as it has always been — supporting the growth of 

companies and technologies involved in the future of finance. In 

achieving this, we must stay on top of compliance and innovation 

while maintaining as much of what being a Bitcoiner meant all 

those years back. 

The crypto sector has treated us very well and we aim to 

continue supporting the space as we believe it may grow to a 

trillion dollar market and beyond. We feel the market is now 

ready for the BF Token to solve some of the scaling bottlenecks 

we are facing and can allow us to open up to a wider audience. 

We aim to do this through a membership and rewards token 

outlined in detail in this whitepaper. 

We know that traditional banks and financial institutions now 

want to take over our sector as it grows large enough for them to 

take notice, but we aim to support companies that make them 

less relevant, not more relevant.

To do this, we are proud to introduce to you the BF Token.

We know firsthand how 

important it is to get the 

regulations, technicals and 

market conditions correct, 

all while  preventing as 

much market manipulation 

as possible. 

We believe that we are now 

ready to combine the power 

of Blockchain technology 

with the years of best 

practices in the equity 

markets to launch 

equity-backed tokens 

utilizing smart contracts to 

trade on a secondary 

market in a regulated 

environment.

Having watched the growth of 

ICO’s and Token Sales, our 

investors are demanding similar 

liquidity, secondary market 

trading and live pricing for equity 

investments, but with the same 

reputable deals and investor 

protections that they have been 

used to when investing through 

BnkToTheFuture.com. They also 

want more frequent updates on 

the companies they have 

invested in. 

We have been working on this 

goal for half a decade now but 

the regulatory, technical and 

market hurdles have been 

extremely challenging.

3.2
WHAT OUR 
INVESTORS WANT

3.3
REGULATORY CHALLENGE

Our investors on the BnkToTheFuture.com platform want us to offer 

them a solution that is very simple to understand and utilize, but this 

presents us with three major challenges that need to be solved: 

01.     Real time pricing of their equity investments. 

02.    Liquidity to exit their private equity investments when they 

want.

03.    Transparency for trading their private equity and access to                            

updated information.                      

Sounds like a reasonable request, right? But to achieve this it requires 

breaking new ground simultaneously in three areas — regulatory, 

technical and market. 

We have been working through regulatory challenges for over 7 

years now and have built what we believe to be the most convenient 

and compliance-driven on-boarding process for qualifying investors, 

with an aggressive roadmap of improvements to make this even 

better.

3.4
TECHNICAL 
CHALLENGE

3.5
TRANSPARENT
MARKET CHALLENGE 

We believe we have overcome the regulatory and technical hurdles, 

but our next challenge is the hardest one - how to create the most 

transparent market possible. To achieve this goal we feel that the 

introduction of a new membership and rewards token can be used to 

create market incentives that should lead to a more transparent 

market for our industry. 

 

Blockchain enables new 

technical possibilities for us 

with regards to transparency 

of information, fast 

settlement, and new 

liquidity, but in the 

investment sector it needs to  

operate within existing 

securities law to remain legal 

and compliant.  

Often the technical developments 

fail to comply with existing laws 

and they always proceed 

regulatory changes meaning new 

technology often has to be 

shoehorned into outdated 

securities laws. We believe we 

have struck the right balance 

between technical innovation and 

compliance.

PROBLEMS WE HAVE  
SOLVED SO FAR

21.

On the regulatory side, we are a compliance-driven company and we are 

proud of our multi-jurisdictional structure that allows for the buying and 

selling of private equity for qualifying investors around the globe. 

Our legal structure allows private companies to deal with only one 

institutional investor while benefiting from the liquidity of many investors 

in over 25 traditional currencies and 35 cryptocurrencies while we reduce 

the regulatory and compliance burden for the company and give investors 

additional protections through our unique syndicate structure. 

On the technical side, we have built a proven model that has facilitated 

investments through over 47, 500 qualifying investors with over 100 of the 

top FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies in the primary markets. 

Through our platform we have co-invested in funding rounds with top tier 

Venture Capital firms. 

We believe we now have the technology, partners and regulatory structure 

to launch our secondary market for tokenizing and trading private equity 

using the Blockchain, in a compliance-driven way.

On the transparent market side we have identified three major 

challenges to overcome:

01.    Sourcing & researching good FinTech, Bitcoin & Blockchain deals 

is currently a hugely centralised and inefficient process.

02.    Performing due diligence on FinTech, Bitcoin & Blockchain 

companies before listing them is heavily dependent on a few skilled 

people.

03.    Investor relations is expensive and very time consuming for our 

listed companies and yet not frequent enough to satisfy our investors 

appetite for information.  

In the public market these problems have traditionally been tackled 

through tighter rules, regulations and internal standards that create a 

more transparent market but lead to slow, expensive and time 

consuming legal and audit processes that still result in billions of dollars 

in market abuse and fines. Public companies hire dedicated personnel 

to deal with their investor relations, a luxury that startups don’t have. 

We believe we can chip away at these problems one step at a time by 

introducing BFT, the BF Token that powers the next phase of growth 

for BnkToTheFuture.com. Through incentivising certain behaviour 

through a membership and rewards token we feel we can break some 

new grounds that make for a more transparent marketplace. To be clear 

the BnkToTheFuture.com platform is aiming to allow for the trading of 

equity-backed tokens but BFT itself is not an equity-backed token. BFT 

is our membership and rewards token that will be used by members as 

described in this whitepaper.

The goal of the BF Token is to use a community of incentivized token 

holders to help us create a fairer, more transparent and efficient 

marketplace for Fintech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies on 

BnkToTheFuture.com, who are rewarded by the value of their 

participation whilst achieving the goal of creating a more transparent 

market. The BF token acts as a membership and rewards token that 

unlocks certain parts of our platform and gives VIP access to token 

holders but without access to the investment part of our platform 

and having to meet the requirements of a qualifying professional 

investor. 

24.

WE AIM TO CHIP AWAY AT OUR THREE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS 

ONE-BY-ONE BY ALLOWING OUR INCENTIVISED TOKEN 

HOLDER COMMUNITY TO STAKE AND BID ON BOUNTY 

PROGRAMS THAT DECENTRALIZE PARTS OF THE THREE 

PRIMARY PROBLEMS WE IDENTIFIED ABOVE. THE END 

RESULT IS TO USE THE BF TOKEN TO CREATE A 

TRANSPARENT TRADING MARKET FOR FINTECH, BITCOIN & 

BLOCKCHAIN EQUITY TOKENS.

Our current policy for listing on BnkToTheFuture.com involves a 

highly centralized approach performed by our team analyzing 

hundreds of online applications and rejecting roughly 95% of them 

based upon our filtration process. We believe that a more 

decentralized approach can be achieved by involving the whole 

community and incentivizing them to identify, select and conduct 

research on the best deals in the industry. 

The BF Token can be used to stake on deals that our community 

would like to see listed on our platform while rewarding those that 

find and perform research on new deals.

Before listing on our online investment platform our BF team 

performs a due diligence process with the companies which 

involves the creation and verification of documentation, 

materials and videos that are fair, clear and not misleading to 

investors. While our BF team and regulated partners conduct 

additional checks on pitch information, we are unable to verify 

real time content on pitch forums etc. without significantly 

slowing down the process which does not work in a live 

secondary market environment. 

We aim to introduce a hybrid model where our securities 

businesses and registered broker/dealer partners undertake the 

compliant part of verifying material data, certification and other 

processes such as research, analysis of deals and fact checking, 

while the community is rewarded for performing additional 

research, analysis and due diligence. 

In order to participate in the marketplace companies and token 

holders will be required to use the BF Token.

As listed private companies progress, the need for investor 

relations can become a big burden to an already stretched 

private company, yet investors want regular updates on company 

progress to make more informed decisions. 

By using the BF Token our listed companies can be rewarded for 

providing more frequent investor updates while our community 

of token holders are rewarded for sharing, commenting, posting 

press releases and discussions around publicly available 

information on our investor forums. Fake news or data can be 

punished, whilst good research and reliable sources of data can 

be rewarded. 

We believe this will keep more investors up-to-date with the 

latest information while freeing up companies to focus on their 

already existing public relations process and incentivising token 

holders when they take time out for investor updates. 

Community token members with a good reputation can be 

rewarded for hosting live video interviews with companies, whilst 

the company is rewarded for taking the time out for giving such 

interviews with the aim of improving the flow of updates and 

information from the companies to our qualifying investors.

4.2
EQUITY BACKED TOKENS

At Bnk To The Future we hold equity in some of the most 

valuable companies in the Bitcoin and Blockchain sector. Each 

investment is held within its own investment vehicle through our 

sister company. By taking each of these special investment 

companies and making each share exchangeable for a token 

backed by shares, our investors are able to hold their own 

investments on a whitelisted smart contract that can be 

exchanged with other whitelisted qualifying investors allowing 

them to trade with each other with securities laws in mind. To be 

clear these equity backed tokens are not connected to the BF 

Token.  

While the BF Token was designed to bring transparency to our 

markets and be available for all to participate, qualifying 

investors will be able to benefit from tokenizing their equity into 

equity-backed tokens that give them the ability to hold their 

securities within their control and  trade them with other 

whitelisted members in a compliance-driven way. 

We feel that using Blockchain technology and smart contracts in this 

way allows us to solve the most common requests from our investors 

whilst simultaneously allowing for a wider audience to participate in 

the utility of our BF Token.

THE REGULATORY 
LANDSCAPE 

The buying, selling and trading of securities is a highly 

regulated field. From day one we have been working with legal 

counsel in multiple jurisdictions to ensure as best we can that 

we are in compliance with major international securities laws 

and that we secure the required registrations with regulators. 

While every effort has been taken to ensure compliance with 

international securities law, there is still regulatory risk that our 

planned roadmap may not go as planned, experience 

significant setbacks and delays for regulatory reasons or even 

be prohibited altogether due to regulatory hurdles and 

changes in international securities laws. We have followed a 

regulatory compliance roadmap to make every effort to ensure 

we are in compliance with some of the major international 

securities laws.

We started our journey by engaging legal counsel to comply with UK 

Securities law and allow UK high net worth and sophisticated 

investors to purchase private equity in UK companies. This involved 

allowing sophisticated investors that are sufficiently qualified to 

understand the risks of investing in private equity to use our online 

investment platform. We also introduced our suitability quiz that 

tests investors qualifying status on their understanding of investing 

in private equity to ensure they understand that investing in startups 

and early stage businesses involves risks, including illiquidity, lack of 

dividends, loss of investment and dilution, and it should be done only 

as part of diversified portfolio. BnkToTheFuture.com exclusively 

targets investors who are sufficiently sophisticated to understand 

these risks and make their own investment decisions.

5.2 
PHASE 2

We then set out to build our platform in a compliance-driven way that 

may meet the required compliance status with more international 

securities laws, excluding investors residing in the United States. This 

involved obtaining additional registrations with the Cayman Island 

Monetary Authority, bringing in additional legal counsel to develop our 

compliance processes further and developing unique user on-boarding 

processes and procedures for multiple jurisdictions.

We engaged some of the top US legal counsel to help us develop a 

unique process in compliance with SEC / FINRA rules and 

regulations. This also involved several acquisitions and partnerships 

whilst developing a unique structure to separate US clients from 

non-US clients. 

5.4
PHASE 4

We engaged further legal counsel to develop a process for the 

compliant purchase of tokens through our online platform through a 

Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) so we can host other 

clients completing token sales through utility or security tokens.

5.5
PHASE 5

In order to facilitate the compliance-driven trading of privately held 

securities we partnered with, invested in and sought approval for an 

Alternative Trading System (ATS) registered with the SEC.

We believe that our carefully 

planned strategy and 

investment in legal counsel 

and compliance with multiple 

jurisdictions, as well as our suit 

of companies registered with 

different regulatory bodies 

gives us what we need in 

order to facilitate the buying, 

selling and trading of privately 

held securities and tokens. We 

also have relationships with 

the most valuable companies 

in the sector in many cases 

being one of their first 

investors.

We have overcome some 

major regulatory challenges, 

but our complete plan and 

execution may  still be subject 

to regulatory approval and 

therefore involves regulatory 

risks. While the BF Token is a 

membership and rewards 

token, its utility is dependent 

upon the successful execution 

of our planned roadmap that 

involves regulatory risks that 

may slow down or prohibit 

the execution of our plans.

TOKEN 
FUNCTION &
SUPPLY

The BnkToTheFuture.com platform will include multiple tiered 

membership access which shall be available to different 

member/user types. Staking the BF token will ‘unlock’ new 

functions for these different member/user types, enabling the 

tokens to serve as a stake and perform special actions on the 

platform, where they could lose their stake if they break 

established rules.

First and foremost, members will stake their tokens to constitute 

membership. There are a variety of roles that members play on 

the platform: each requires a certain staking balance. This 

balance can be lost over time if the member undertakes certain 

actions on the platform. Members can play multiple simultaneous 

roles, but they would need to stake enough tokens to satisfy 

requirements for all of them. In almost all cases, violating rules 

can result in some stake being burned.

6.1
BNKTOTHEFUTURE.COM 
MEMBER ROLES

6.2
ALL TOKEN HOLDERS

Some token functionality will be available for all members (i.e. anyone 

holding BFT), while other functions will be limited to qualifying 

investors on the platform as usual. The roles that token holders can play 

are explained below. These roles will be referred to by the titles in 

parenthesis.

All roles are eligible to earn BF tokens, which are distributed via a set of 

reward pools, discussed in more detail below.

6.2.1  Ability to source deals (Community Sourcing): BF Token holders 

can post information about prospective companies (“projects”) that they 

believe would be a good match for the BF platform. These projects then 

compete for votes from the wider BF community. Projects receiving the 

most votes during a predetermined voting period will be automatically 

selected for further due diligence by the BF community. 

If a project is chosen, the member who posted the project, and the 

members who voted for it, will receive rewards. At this point, projects may 

either go through the Community Assessment review (described below) 

or directly to the BF due diligence team at BF’s discretion. In addition, 

qualifying investors can signal interest by staking tokens that could give 

him/her priority in participating in the sale if the project gets listed.

6.2.2  Ability to help evaluate potential BF candidates 

(Community Assessment): community members will be able to 

assist BF in identifying and evaluating potential companies to list 

on the platform by providing answers to a set of predefined 

questions. Members who provide high-quality and valuable 

insights can earn rewards from a rewards pool if BF team 

approves such updates at BF discretion.

6.2.3  Ability to provide third-party research and service for BF 

Platform listings (Community Research): community members 

can bid to serve as third-party reviewers who write investor 

reports on offerings listed on the BF platform. Members could 

also be eligible to produce content for companies or provide due 

diligence, available exclusively on the BF Platform. 

6.2.4  Ability to provide company updates (Community 

Information): members can also post company updates on BF 

platform listings in the form of investor communications, 

interviews and news article links, video reviews, company 

marketing materials, etc.  Companies themselves can post these 

updates too, earning token rewards if BF team approves such 

updates at BF discretion.

For more detailed information about how these would work on 

the platform, including measures against spam mitigation and 

additional considerations, please see Appendix A, which 

proposed a set of parameters to deal with challenges such 

schemes might introduce.

6.3
QUALIFYING 
INVESTOR TOKEN 
HOLDERS

The BF Token may have uses for existing members on the BF 

Platform and BF could choose to introduce these functions at some 

point in the future. Some possibilities of certain functionality may 

include: 

01.  A membership that allows people to trade with little to no fees, 

so as to encourage liquidity; 

02.  A membership that allows priority access to oversubscribed 

deals; 

03.  Access to bonuses for early participation in deals. 

These are not yet approved or finalized and will not be 

operational when the BF token is issued, but BF is actively 

exploring options and models.

6.4
WIDER 
PARTICIPATION 

The overall goal for the BF 

Token is to build a community 

of incentivized token holders to 

help us create a fairer, more 

transparent and efficient 

marketplace for Fintech, Bitcoin 

and Blockchain companies on 

BnkToTheFuture.com where 

token holders are rewarded by 

the value of their participation 

in achieving the goal of creating 

a more transparent market for 

the sector. 

Anybody can earn BFT by 

unlocking membership access 

on the BnkToTheFuture.com 

platform and participating in the 

research, investor relations and 

due diligence reviews. Although 

not all token holders will have 

access to investing and trading 

on our online investment 

platform, they do gain exposure 

to the ownership benefits of the 

BF tokens. 

In this sense the BF Token is 

rewarded for those that engage 

in high quality work performed 

on the platform which shall be 

subject to the approval and 

acceptance by the BF team at 

BF discretion. Larger token 

holders can also use their BF 

Token as a ‘stake’ to prove that 

they meet the net worth 

criteria of being a qualifying 

member of the BF Platform and 

access full token rights offered 

to qualified investors only. 

Token holders may aim to 

accumulate tokens through 

their work on the platform with 

the goal of building tokens that 

allow them to qualify as a 

qualified investor should the 

value of BF tokens reach a 

certain threshold acting as a 

proof of resources for our 

qualifying investor verification.

Token holders can also have access to the insights generated on 

the platform. Even people who aren’t qualifying investors can 

stake tokens to read the results of the community assessment, 

this will help them seek out alternative ways to purchase tokens 

outside of the BF platform, or make their own determination 

even if the sale is not listed on the BF platform. 

At minimum, the community review process is likely to sort the 

market into broad categories of project quality. 

6.6
STAKING PROCESS
AND AMOUNTS

When users opt to stake their tokens, they are locked for a 

period of time and only functional on the platform. 

Staking amounts will be denominated by Bnk To The Future, 

though Bnk To The Future will be periodically adjusting them 

based on market prices to ensure membership is not out of reach 

for new members.

6.7
REWARD 
POOLS 

When users perform actions on the platform, they can be rewarded 

with tokens from several reward pools, which are dedicated 

specifically to different members, which shall be subject to the 

approval and acceptance by the BF team at BF discretion. The 

distribution will most likely be done by Bnk To The Future, though 

the method of distribution and the method of calculation will be 

transparent and auditable on the Blockchain.

Each pool has its own method of distribution, all based on the 

quality of contribution performed by the member. These are 

discussed in greater detail in the Appendix A.

The pools will be seeded by releasing tokens held in a reward 

reserve pool and can be ‘topped up’ by Bnk To The Future itself, 

using either its own token reserve or purchased tokens. Since the 

community is helping offset costs, Bnk To The Future can divert 

some BF tokens toward the reward pools to further incentivize 

contribution. It could also add to the reward pools if BF felt that the 

reward pools balance was insufficient.

At no time can Bnk To The Future take tokens from the reward pool 

for itself.  Please see the Appendix A for a discussion on the rewards 

pool.

At contract creation, Bnk To The Future will mint all BFT that 

will ever exist. However, a portion of those tokens will be 

withheld for issuance approximately over ten years, though the 

timeline may vary based on several conditions. Issued tokens 

will seed the reward pools that ultimately reward community 

members for their contributions.

40.

BF’S INTENTION IS TO RELEASE THESE TOKENS 

PERIODICALLY TO COINCIDE WITH PLATFORM GROWTH. THE 

INITIAL PLAN IS TO RELEASE A NUMBER OF TOKENS EQUAL 

TO A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE TRANSACTED ON THE 

PLATFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, BNK TO THE FUTURE MAY SAY IT 

WILL RELEASE 2% OF THE USD VALUE OF INVESTMENTS 

CONDUCTED OVER THE PREVIOUS MONTH. IF, FOR 

EXAMPLE,US$20 MILLION WAS ISSUED AND SOLD, US 

$100,000 WORTH OF BF TOKENS WOULD BE RELEASED 

INTO THE REWARD POOLS.

7.    Private Investor Relations Portal

Each deal comes with a private forum where all investors can publish 

investor updates and receive feedback and Q&A from their investors. 

Once they post an update it notifies all investors simultaneously and 

investors have the ability to comment and interact directly with the 

company they invested with. 

8.    Company Pages

Companies have their own dedicated pages that outline all important 

information for investors. In the upcoming future releases investors will 

be able to trade equity backed tokens from these pages and make 

investments on behalf of a company should they qualify to invest. 

9.    Primary Offerings

Companies selling new shares or tokens via our platform gain access to 

a simple and easy to use pitch creation wizard to make the process of 

listing on our platform fluent and intuitive. This comes together to 

create a pitch listing.

10.    Fiat & Crypto Payments

Each pitch can choose to accept payments from 25 fiat currencies and 

35 cryptocurrencies. We also support card payments and bank transfers 

through our compliant escrow agent. Payments made in 

cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin or Ether, such as Altcoins are 

automatically converted to Bitcoin to prevent excessive currency risks 

from multiple tokens. 

Once we have completed our token sale we plan to execute the  

following technical road map.

8.1
TOKEN SALE STRUCTURE
Bnk To The Future BFT SP is a Segregated Portfolio of Bnk To The Future 

Capital SPC and has been appointed to issue the tokens from the Cayman 

Islands. 

Phase 1 is for investors that wish to invest in our investment contract that gives them 

an entitlement to BFT in the future

Qualifying investors on BnkToTheFuture.com are the only ones who are able to 

invest in the BFT Investment Contract during the pre-sale phase and must meet 

the criteria to be eligible to invest through BnkToTheFuture.com.

We have engaged a US-broker dealer - Keystone Capital Corporation who is 

registered with FINRA/SEC to act as our placement agent for US investors and 

have appointed Bnk To The Future to facilitate the investment for non-US 

investors.  

The public sale is where any non-US user that wishes to use the token can 

purchase between US$1,000 and US$10,000 worth of the token at a set ETH 

exchange rate that will be set just prior to the public token sale going live. They 

will need to have a BnkToTheFuture.com account and get their ETH Address 

whitelisted. 

The public sale will be for a minimum of 300 to a maximum of 3,000 

purchasers only who wish to purchase approximately US$1,000 to US$10,000 

worth of BF Tokens. We are limiting the purchase as we want to do what we 

reasonably can to attract purchasers that are not purchasing the tokens with 

the misconception of thinking it’s an investment, or that they are not using the 

token as an ‘investment’ and instead they intend to use the token to contribute 

to our BFT community.

All investors and purchasers pay the same price. There is no tiered pricing 

and no discounts or bonuses that favour any single investor or purchaser. 

Our token sale is broken into two phases: 

Phase 2 is for the community members that wish to purchase and use the token’s 

utility and become members of the BFT community

8.4 
OUR TOKEN SALE GOALS & 
VALUES - WHAT MAKES US 
DIFFERENT? 

01.   We believe we have enough demand to make a fair offering on the 

token sale price for both the pre sale and public sale with no back door 

deals, bonuses or discounts that could dilute value. Everybody gets the 

same price.

02.   We are already oversubscribed through whitelisted commitments 

within our network, our goal is to  achieve large leftover demand for our 

token. 

03.   We have thought greatly about aligning the interests of our clients, 

investors, token holders & company.

04.   We are already well capitalised and will be focusing on the value of 

our tokens with a 2 year lock in agreement for our company tokens. We 

are not doing this as a substitute for raising finance.

05.   We have learned a lot about what makes a good token sale and 

market, we have aimed to setup a compliance-driven legal structure 

(structured as a Reg. D pre sale offering).

06.   We have been here since 2010, launched the platform to go live 

officially in 2015 and we are committed to one clear mission with no 

plans to jump ship to the next money grab opportunity.

development)

11.1 
MISSION & FUTURE PLANS 

11.2
REAL-TIME PRICING 

We believe that by launching the BF Token we are able to significantly 

improve aspects of the BnkToTheFuture.com platform that enables us to 

launch a transparent trading market in a regulated environment for both 

the primary and secondary listing of the biggest and most valuable 

FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies, that we could not have 

launched without the token and the resulting community. 

By achieving this goal it may be possible for our sector to have accurate 

and real-time index and pricing data on FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain 

companies for the first time. This data may be used by third party 

researchers and data providers as well as for new investment products. 

Real time pricing and information may also be used to perform 

advanced research and analysis of our sector and give the private 

FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain equity market the liquidity it needs 

while creating more trading opportunities for our qualifying investors 

using Blockchain as the backbone. 

69.



We have not listed all company teams here out of respect for the 

individuals who have opted for privacy and for platform security reasons.

11.3
UNIFICATION OF TOP TIER 
COMPLIANT CRYPTO EXCHANGES

11.4
WIDER PARTICIPATION  

We believe we can unite the top tier crypto exchanges that we have 

invested in, both centralized and decentralized, to allow for the 

compliant trading of private FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies, 

built by the community for the community as we grow our platform into 

a compliant API layer for crypto exchanges in the future. 

International regulations mean that our platform can only be used by 

qualifying investors, but due to the rise in crypto wealth this number of 

high net worth investors has exploded. Should we reach our goals, the 

BF Token can be used by all to participate in our ecosystem through our 

membership utility token without having to be a high net worth / 

qualifying investor.

11.5
MORE HIGH-NET WORTH CRYPTO 
INVESTORS

As our eco-system grows this may contribute to growing the number of 

high-net worth investors that qualify to invest through our online 

investment platform. The more that qualify to invest, the more invest 

via our platform supporting the growth of the industry. The more 

investment, the more liquidity in the secondary market. The more 

liquidity in the secondary markets, the more investment in the primary 

markets. The more investing and trading, the higher our FinTech, Bitcoin 

and Blockchain industry market capitalisation can grow. 

71.

11.6
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS  

The BF Token exists to incentive higher quality and transparent 

information flows between companies and investors. If we achieve our 

goals, this should lead to better deals being listed on our online 

investment platform. With every deal listed, we believe the value of the 

BF token eco-system can grow. We believe that the more investment 

flows into new financial innovation (that is independent of traditional 

financial players like investment and retail banks), the larger the market 

capitalisation of our token and equity market grows.

By powering the BnkToTheFuture.com platform with the BF Token, we 

aim to create a feedback loop and eco-system that plays its role in 

driving the crypto and equity market cap for the FinTech, Bitcoin and 

Blockchain sector to US$1 trillion and beyond.

With ICO’s gaining the attention of regulators all around the world, the 

industry will have to adapt to more regulations. Either our industry will 

give all the business to the very banks and financial institutions we set 

out to disrupt, or we can use platforms like BnkToTheFuture.com that 

were founded by a team that believed in Bitcoin before it was cool to 

believe in Bitcoin and Blockchain. 

We have been working with regulations from Day 1, have been a part of 

the growth of the industry and investing in the sector since 2011. We are 

supporters of the decentralised unregulated markets too, but we 

believe there will be two markets in the future — both regulated and 

unregulated, and the two can support each other. This philosophy made 

us the only choice for many of the largest and most reputable Bitcoin, 

Blockchain & FinTech companies to find investment without too much of 

a huge regulatory burden and this is something we aim to continue. 

Thank you for taking this journey with us and being part of the most 

exciting time to be alive in financial history. We thank all who have 

contributed to the growth of the crypto community and for working on 

something that we believe will change the future of finance forever.

APPENDIX A  
 
BFT Functionality and User Experience

Ability to Source Deals (Community Sourcing)

Anyone with a stake in BFT can provide info on a company (this helps 

to reduce spam) and submit their info of the company for community 

review. 

Once a company information is submitted for review, it goes into a 

batch alongside other companies in order to compete for votes for an 

average of two weeks period (time may be adjusted based on 

participation). To vote, users can stake BFT to serve as a vote on 

behalf of individual companies. Voting per company per user will be 

capped in BFT (explained in further details below). At the end of the 

voting period, the company with the most overall votes will move on 

to the next round of review, which could involve entering the queue of 

projects reviewed by the community, or could involve BF directly 

contacting the company. 

In addition, Bnk To The Future will have discretion to nominate any 

other projects for follow-up review/interview. People who vote and 

those who submitted high quality information for vote and in affect 

the companies get selected for follow-up interview with BF team will 

be rewarded BFT tokens from the rewards pool in proportion to their 

staked BFT. All voting stakes for companies that do not pass this 

round of interview with BF team (companies that do not receive 

enough votes) will be returned to voters, minus a fee to keep voting 

from being risk-free. 

73.

R Voting caps

There will be a dynamic cap on voting, such that the cap on each 

successive vote is lower than that on the vote before. This will help 

ensure early voters are rewarded and that people can’t easily log in at 

the last minute and ‘bet on the winning horse,’ diluting the rewards for 

previous voters. An example of how the caps will work is as follows: 

the first vote will be capped at 10 staked BFT, the second at 95% of 

this cap (9.5), the third at 95% of that (9.052), and so forth, until votes 

reach a minimum floor. 

Separately but related, during the voting period, qualifying investors 

with access to the trading and investment platform (registration 

required) can also stake BFT to a prospective company’s listing. This 

stake does NOT count as a vote, though the same investors can also 

vote for companies in the same manner as everyone else. If the 

company is selected, members who staked during these early stages 

will get priority access to a small portion of issued shares proportional 

to the USD value of BFT they stake, up to a maximum of US$50,000. 

Staking from qualified investors might be a stronger signal of a 

potential successful sale. BF will extract a small fee (TBD, tentatively 

set at 1%) from these staked tokens to ensure investors only stake on 

projects they are passionate about or interested in.

BF initially proposes this membership cost US$10 worth of tokens, 

valued on the first day of operation and updated quarterly. Voting 

maximum caps will also be US$10.

R Ability to Help Filter Deal-flow (Community Assessment)

Projects that successfully gain enough votes to pass the initial 

sourcing review (as well as any additional companies BF decides to 

include) will be subject to a second phase of community review aimed 

at further narrowing the field of prospect companies. This assessment 

review runs as follows:

01.    If a member would like to assess deals, s/he stakes BFT and 

indicates their availability. Applications are randomly allocated to 

those who stake and express interest.

 

02.    These members must answer a set of questions about a project, 

including a recommendation on whether it fits BF’s platform.

03.    These answers are then reviewed by another set of reviewers, 

called 'Super-reviewers'. Serving as a Super-reviewer requires a higher 

BFT stake. This review process will involve highlighting the best 

response and flagging particularly poor ones.

04.    Rewards will be drawn from the reward pool and are split 

between the reviewers, with the best review getting slightly more and 

the poor ones losing a portion of their staked BFT.

BF initially proposes that reviewers must stake between US$50 - 

US$100 in BFT to participate (the more the stake, the higher the 

probability of being selected by the system and the higher the 

potential rewards from the reward pool), with 10% lost if their report is 

deemed inaccurate or unusable by the Super-reviewers and/or BF due 

diligence team. Bidding to be a Super-reviewer will require US$1,000 

in BFT.

Review bounty

BF may implement a policy whereby projects can stake BF tokens as 

review bounties to elevate the importance of their application. This 

can entitle it to “expedited processing” by the community. Such a 

bounty would have a low cap, to ensure projects couldn’t bid their 

way to the front of the line. But it offers projects a way to get noticed, 

while knowing that all proceeds go to the community, not BF. BF will 

set the bounty amounts and adjust periodically.

Ability to provide third-party research and updates on BF platform 

listings (Community Research)

01.    Members with sufficient BFT can bid to provide research reports 

on investments on the platform by staking BFT and indicating their 

availability.

02.    Up to three members are selected to provide insights.

03.    During the investment phase, actual investors rank which reports 

were the most helpful, with the option of flagging any as close to 

worthless.

04.    High quality reports will receive BFT as a reward, drawn from 

the rewards pool and distributed according to investor feedback. 

Reports that are deemed unhelpful will lose a portion of their staked 

BFT.

Members will bid US$50 - US$500 in BFT for the chance to provide 

research reports and updates (the more BFT a member bids, the 

better their chance of being chosen).

Ability to provide third-party research and updates on BF platform 

listings (Community Information)

01.    Members with sufficient BFT can also post company updates on 

BF platform listings in the form of investor communications, 

interviews and news article links, video reviews, company marketing 

materials, etc. 

02.    Bnk To The Future will be responsible for verifying the quality of 

materials presented to identify spam or misinformation. Posting spam 

or misinformation will incur a penalty in tokens.

03.    Reports and updates deemed helpful by investors entitle their 

authors to rewards.

Note: This is the only reward pool that will be specific to a company. 

Each company has its own reward pool that incentivizes participation. 

The distribution schedule will be set for five years, distributed on a 

bi-weekly basis.

Members will only need to bid US$50 in BFT for the chance to provide 

updates or information on the forums. Multiple members could all 

provide meaningful updates, although duplicate updates and postings 

will not be rewarded.

known to the buyer or the public. Buyers of tokens should perform 

their own due diligence prior to purchasing.

Transferability

Tokens may be, or will be subject to transfer restrictions. Tokens 

subject to the transfer restriction will not be transferable, 

distributable or usable by holders of such tokens. If the token fails to

for the purpose of the securities laws, which may have an adverse 

impact on your purchase.

Disclaimers

Nothing herein constitutes an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an 

offer to buy any tokens, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or

will be subject to many challenges, competition and changing 

environment. We will try to update our community as things grow 

and change, but undertake no obligation to do so.
