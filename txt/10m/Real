Abstract 

Real Estate has been historically considered the best way to preserve wealth. However, Real Estate 
investments today present significant inefficiencies such as lack of efficiency and liquidity. 

REAL (Real Estate Asset Ledger) team is applying Blockchain technologies to the world of Real 
Estate investments in order to solve those issues. REAL is an Ethereum Smart-Contracts governed 
ecosystem that focuses on creating the best conditions for Real Estate investment eliminating costs 
due to unnecessary intermediaries, providing transparency and liquidity, alleviating tax inefficiencies 
and easing cross-border transactions under a unified crowdfunding platform. 

This paper explains the principles of the REAL ecosystem, our execution plan and the economic 
arguments for the economic value of a REAL Token.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

REAL (Real Estate Asset Ledger) is a new Ethereum Smart-Contracts governed ecosystem that 
applies Blockchain technologies to the enormous Real Estate investment industry, giving greater 
access to global investment in Real Estate, lowering barriers to entry, and increasing market liquidity.

It will offer an effective method of investing and securing the value of the existing 50-100 Billion USD 
equivalent in cryptocurrency into the less volatile and growing Real Estate market by generating rental 
income and value appreciation.

REAL Founders have invested USD 350.000 in the company, have a strong successful execution 
track-record and reputation, have founded and exited high profile online startups over the last 20 
years and have held executive positions at Google, Yahoo and top Venture Capital firms in Europe 
(see founders references on page 34). 
 
In November this year, a full fledged site will be launched leveraging the Crowdfunding formula, where 
any user will be able to invest in a fraction of a Real Estate asset with REAL Tokens, gaining profit 
rights (rental income+value appreciation) awarded by a smart contract and paid with Ether.

BACKGROUND 

“Real estate crowdfunding continues to be a dynamic and ever-evolving industry, growing to an 
estimated $3.5 billion in 2016. By 2025, the crowdfunding industry as a whole is anticipated to be 
valued at more than $300 billion and online real estate marketplaces are primed to capitalize on that 
explosive growth.” (Forbes)
 
REAL team believes that one of the most impactful and exciting applications of Blockchain 
technologies will be within the Real Estate market, especially within the Crowdfunding space. 
 
The use of Blockchain technology in the field of Real Estate Crowdfunding has the potential to 
completely revolutionize the sector, giving greater access to investment in global Real Estate, 
lowering barriers to entry and increasing market liquidity.

According to The Guardian, a recent U.S. Real Estate study showed that “Chinese investors have 
poured $110 billion dollars into the U.S. market in the last 5 years (both commercial and residential). 
This investment is set to double in the next 5 years.” In all likelihood, a certain amount of these 
investment funds will find their way into alternative funding options such as Real Estate Crowdfunding 
as foreign investment expands in the U.S. Experts believe this tendency towards growth is largely due 
to worldwide economic uncertainty and foreign investors seeking new destinations for their 
investments.
 
Thanks to our Crowdfunding site, people from all over the world will benefit from Real Estate profit 
potential worldwide while performing transactions with ease. We are confident that a Real Estate 
Crowdfunding platform that uses Blockchain and cryptocurrency will revolutionize the market.

THE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM

We are combining two of the most recent disruptions in the online world: Real Estate Crowdfunding 
and Blockchain technology. As a result, we are inventing a whole new way to invest. We will offer 
anyone from any part of the world invest in Real Estate assets using cryptocurrency (transformed into 
REAL Tokens), generating profits paid in cryptocurrency like Ether or similar.
 
REAL will offer simple and transparent property investments that remove the uncertainties usually 
faced by small investors and enabling virtually anybody to build a property based investment portfolio 
that delivers predictable and consistent returns. We believe in diversifying investments and therefore 
we will offer a range of products with varying levels of risk and reward for users to invest in.

On our Crowdfunding site, users will be able to exchange REAL Tokens for economic rights of a 
property and will be backed by physical Real Estate. Our users will also be able to trade their 
investments at our platform, turning Real Estate investments into liquid investments.  

REAL.MARKETS HOME SCREENSHOT:

 • Marketplace Fee 

There are a variety of fee structures in Crowdfunding deals, which range from annual fees as well as 
partial participation in upside returns and participation in profits on exit. 
We believe the most transparent and interest-aligned formula is a profit share fee, so our interests are 
aligned which incentivizes us to make the best returns for our users. 

�5



REAL will earn a 10% commission fee on all income or value appreciation profits from investments 
made through the platform. For example, if a property participation generates 100 ETH in profits, 
REAL platform will keep 10 ETH and pay 90 ETH to the investor. 

• The users will be able to invest their tokens into different properties worldwide.

REAL INITIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

REAL boasts an exceptional team of founders and advisors with extensive experience and a first-rate 
reputation in offering real estate services, for both residential and commercial properties. REAL is 
growing its investment team and has an excellent track record in all areas: investments, portfolio 
development, asset management, generation of returns, capital markets, and mergers & acquisitions.

REAL allows property owners and developers to tokenize their assets and list them on our 
Crowdfunding site. Our mission will be the selection, acquisition and management of diversified real 
estate assets, through careful selection, curation, value investing and impeccable portfolio 
management. Our objective is to generate growth in income and value for our investors and to 
maximize returns in a long-term and sustainable manner.   

We follow a “value investing” strategy, meaning we choose investments for less than what we believe 
is their intrinsic value (i.e. their replacement cost). Value investing has tended to produce more stable 
returns over the long term, a strategy to which many of the most famous investors have attributed 
their success. We focus in handpicked opportunities: Buy-to-let commercial property investments, 
discounted buy-to-sell “flip” opportunities and loan-note investments.  

Through careful selection, REAL will acquire a portfolio of desirable real estate properties, for both 
residential and commercial purposes, with a view to generating income and adding value.  REAL 
seeks to attain competitive purchase prices, and offers tailor-made rentals and repositioning. 

 
Key ideas:
-The development of a diversified portfolio of top quality residential and commercial properties which 
create high value for both income and capital gains.
-The identification of lucrative investment opportunities in the real estate market to generate higher 
returns.
-An investment analysis aimed at generating higher value through focusing on quality assets in prime 
locations with the potential to generate steady and sustainable cash flows.

We have already identified the Spanish real estate market to provide considerably greater investment 
opportunities in terms of the risk/return ratio than many other countries. However, REAL’s future plans 
include expansion into the North American, Latin American and Asian markets 

Expected Returns: We are targeting 12-20% annual returns depending on the type of asset and 
market risk.
 
Leverage levels: the appropriate leverage will be assessed on a case by case basis depending on the 
risk of each investment. We will target 50% loan-to-value, no operational performance covenants and 
at least 20% headroom in the ability to service the debt.

Opportunity Focus: 

Invest in high-quality hospitality assets on a worldwide basis. Leisure travel benefits from a positive 
secular trend worldwide. As the global economy and GDP per capita grows and increasing % of 
disposable income is devoted to travel. In developed countries, consumers are demanding increasing 
levels of luxury and uniqueness. In emerging economies, an increasing number of consumers have 
the means to travel. Owning high-quality properties in unique locations will drive superior returns. 

Expertise: We will partner with Portblue Hotels, an experienced hotel operator managed by one of our 
Advisors to be offered opportunities from their proprietary deal flow and have a management contract 
with them in the properties we purchase.
 
Geographical Focus: We will initially target opportunities in Spain, Caribbean and USA. Each of these 
markets is benefiting from the following positive trends: 

 • USA: We want to be opportunistic if we get the chance of buying properties in unique markets 
such as NY. 

 • Spain: The strong positive macroeconomic momentum in Europe is strengthening the 
demand for Mediterranean vacation spots. Moreover, safety concerns in Northern Africa has 
structurally shifted demand to Northern Mediterranean destinations. Spain benefits from a 
combination of good weather and cultural appeal. We are particularly focused on supply-
constrained markets with good airport infrastructure such as Ibiza, Mallorca, Menorca and 
Canary Islands. Hotel prices in these destinations have been in an upswing and we expect 
them to continue to generate strong returns. In Spain hotel ownership is fragmented into 
many small businesses that are undermanaged and underinvested. There is significant 
upside from redevelopment opportunities. Cost of debt and availability of leverage remain 
very compelling. 

 • Caribbean: Consumer strength in the US is creating high growth prospects in several mature 
Caribbean hotel markets such as Riviera Maya in Mexico and Punta Cana in Dominican 
Republic. We are also identifying opportunities in niche luxury markets in smaller Caribbean 
islands.

TECHNOLOGIES 

• Blockchain 

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or decentralized database that keeps records of digital 

transactions. Rather than having a central administrator like a traditional database, (think banks, 

governments & accountants), a distributed ledger has a network of replicated databases, 

synchronized via the internet and visible to anyone within the network. Blockchain networks can be 

private with restricted membership similar to an intranet, or public, like the Internet, accessible to any 

person in the world 

When a digital transaction is carried out, it is grouped together in a cryptographically protected block 

with other transactions that have occurred in the last period and sent out to the entire network. Miners 

(members in the network with high levels of computing power) then compete to validate the 

transactions by solving complex coded problems. The first miner to solve the problems and validate 

the block receives a reward.  

The validated block of transactions is then timestamped and added to a chain in a linear, 

chronological order. New blocks of validated transactions are linked to older blocks, making a chain of 

blocks that show every transaction made in the history of that blockchain. The entire chain is 

continually updated so that every ledger in the network is the same, giving each member the ability to 

prove who owns what at any given time.

• Smart contracts 

Ethereum is an open blockchain that works as a decentralized computer. It allows the execution of 

smart contracts.  

Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, 

conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman. 

The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. 

Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With 

smart contracts, you simply drop an ether into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, 

driver’s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the

rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also 

automatically enforce those obligations.

• REAL Tokens (REAL) 

Real Tokens are a digital representation of a participation entry ticket for our crowdfunding site. They 

are divisible until 0.000000000001 REAL (1/1.000.000.000.000 REAL). Real Tokens are minted via a 

Token Sale Smart Contract and can be held in any Ethereum ERC20 compatible Wallet. 

We are using the Minime token developed by Jordi Baylina (Giveth) with built-in vesting functionality. 

It is a great token standard for governance and it is being used in many major token sales like Aragon 

and Status. 

REAL Tokens will be tradable outside REAL platform, as they are an ERC20 Token so they will have 

an inherent value in the exchanges. Users will also be able to use REAL Tokens for acquiring real 

estate economic participations at our crowdfunding platform. 

ERC20 is a standard interface that guarantees the interoperability between tokens. ERC20 tokens are 

a subgroup of Ethereum tokens that comply with specific parameters. To comply completely with 

ERC20 standards the developer has to incorporate a specific number of functions in his smart 

contract that will allow to execute the following actions: 

1. Total token supply 

2. Account balance 

3. Transfer token 

4. Approve spending token 

�11

https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/


THE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM 

We will have a smart contract that will represent the property acquisition (We call this REAL Property 

Contract). This contract will have different steps. Each step will be stamped in the blockchain by the 

contract.  

 

 

 • Once a new property asset is entered in our platform, there will be a list of required tasks to 
be performed. This information will be audited and shared with the platform investors. 

 

 

�12



When we purchase a new property to upload to the platform we will create the property contract 

associated and will populate it with its basic data: 

- Property register ID 

- Acquisition documentation IPFS hash. 

- Custody information IPFS hash. 

- Total amount participations. 

- Value in REAL from each participation. 

When we do that, the system will automatically create all the associate data for the contract and will 

mint the Property participations associated to it so each user will be able to purchase them.  

REAL Property Participation or RPP will represent the shares on each property. Each investor will be 

able to exchange REAL tokens for this property’s participations through our platform. RPPs will also 

be tradable inside REAL platform so any investor will be able to transfer and sell their investment to 

gain liquidity. 

When the users buy RPP with their REAL tokens, the property contract will hold the REAL balance in 

an associated wallet. They will be returned to the user when the property is sold. 

Each month the platform’s property responsible will add to the property smart contract the earnings 

from renting the property so the contract will automatically divide and pay in ETH to each RPP holder.  

If the platform owners decide to sell the property, the distribution of the rental income will get frozen, 

and the platform owners will deposit the profits of the sale (in ETHER) inside the contract, as well as 

the proper legal documentation of the sale. The RPP holders will automatically receive the REAL 

tokens invested when the property was bought plus the ETHER corresponding to the profits of the 

sale related to the RPPs he had at the block when the property was sold.

• Platform diagram 

 

• Process flow 

PROPERTY 

1. REAL Platform invests in the acquisition of a property and offer participations to platform users.  

For that, we will create a REAL Property Contract (RPC), a smart contract of physical property. 

2. REAL Platform creates participations that are offered to the users through REAL Property 

Participations (RPP). Those are internal tokens that describe the participation details for each 

property with their different valuations and participation percentages. 

3. Users will get REAL Tokens in the Token sale or at exchanges. We will facilitate on our site the 

exchanges link where users can buy REAL Tokens. 

4. Once the users have REAL, they will be able to acquire RPP (Real Property Participations) paying 

with REAL Tokens. 

RENTAL PROFITS 

5. Property participations of each property can generate profits through rentals. 

�14



6. These profits will be split according the participation percentage of each user in that property, that 

will be detailed in the RPPs. 

7. Rental profits will be paid monthly among the RPP owners in ETH. 

SALE PROFITS 

8. REAL Platform sells the property. 

9. We will obtain profits from that sale. 

10. Those profits will be split according the percentage that corresponds to each user. As detailed in 

the RPP tokens.  

11. Each user profits will be paid in ETH. 

12. Each user will get their REAL Tokens back when the sale transaction is finished. 

 

�15



• Platform Technologies 

We are creating a robust Dapp on web, desktop and mobile that will allow the users to check their 

investments anytime anywhere. This software is being created with mobile first approach and a strong 

foundation in UX (User eXperience) so it can be used by anyone.  

The web application has the following technologies: 

 • Python 

 • Angular 4 

 • All this packed in Docker containers and deployed by Kubernetes on Google Cloud so we can 

have a really elastic setup that can grow or shrink depending on the current needs.  

Mobile apps are native:  

 • Swift 4 for iOS 

 • Java for Android 

 • Both apps use Realm as local database, that is the fastest and more reliable mobile 

database. 

Desktop app 

 •  Electron, so will be multi platform (Windows, Linux and MacOS) 

Smart contracts 

 • Truffle 

 • Solidity 

 • Zeppelin 

 • Web3 (for python, java,javascript or just RPC depending from where are we calling)

“TOKENOMICS” : Our economic fundamentals

REAL is creating a new agile and liquid investment ecosystem focused in Real Estate. We have 
carefully studied and reviewed the economic model and strategy in order to create, maintain and grow 
the value for everyone involved.

 • How the Crowdfunding site will work  

On our upcoming Crowdfunding site, our users will acquire economic rights of the Real Estate assets 
by paying with REAL Tokens. Price in REAL Tokens will be converted from its FIAT price at market 
price. For example, if a Real Estate asset is worth 1 MM REAL Tokens, many of our users will be able 
to invest in it from as little as 1000 REAL each acquired at the Token Sale or at the Exchanges (we 
will facilitate the purchase through our website using an API to avoid friction).

After the investment has been made, and on a monthly basis, our users will receive their share of the 
rental profits that the Real Estate asset generates. Also, when the investment is liquidated (sold at a 
profit, or sold to another user in the marketplace at our secondary market option), the user will receive 
back his REAL Tokens plus the generated profits.

Profits from REAL investments will always be paid on Ether or any future equivalent cryptocurrency.

We expect that as our site becomes popular, and as our users start receiving regular income and 
profits on a monthly basis, they will want to acquire more REAL Tokens in order to invest in more Real 
Estate assets. This will cause the REAL Token to grow in value and price. We will facilitate the REAL 
Token acquisition from our Crowdfunding site using the exchanges APIs to avoid user friction.

We strongly believe that being a REAL Token holder will be interesting not only for investing in Real 
Estate assets through our Crowdfunding platform, but also for holding them while their price and value 
grow.

�17



 • These are our calculations regarding the potential profit or loss.  

Definitions: 

  

 

If the Real Estate asset is sold for a higher price than the purchase price.

 
Next formula will calculate the user earnings taking into consideration the platform and ethereum fees.  

Profits will be distributed in ETH therefore the only needed step will be a USD/ETH conversion.

User will also get back the REAL Tokens he invested in the property. 
 
In the rare case of losses the REAL fee won’t be applied and the user will lose some of his invested 
Tokens. User won’t ever lose more than his invested Tokens. 

�18



 • REAL Planned growth strategy  

As all tokens will be created at the Token Sale stage, the token will be deflationary. 
 
As more investments are made in the ecosystem, less REAL tokens remain in circulation, so the 
availability of the tokens will be lower every time the holders keep crowdfunding new Real Estate 
investments and as a result we believe the price will go up.

To provide an escalated growth to the platform, the company will introduce the reserved REAL tokens 
from the Token Sale when the 1 year lock period is over in the market by selling REAL in stages when 
new properties are added, following a well planned strategy in order to maintain the Token price. 

On a daily basis, we will calculate the REAL Token volume on the exchanges in order to get a month 
average. If the volume is lower than the optimum threshold we will introduce Tokens according to this 
formula.  

• Real Estate sale timing 

We will sell the Real Estate asset at an established time interval or when the expected return that will 
be published on the platform has been achieved according to this formula. 

�19



• Token Price 

We have studied how the Token price could evolve considering that users reinvest part of their profits 
obtained participating on our crowdfunding site in purchasing more Real tokens to increase their 
investment activity. 

 

These values are approximate. We estimate the average annual yield will be between 12% and 
20% and user reinvestment will be between 20% and 100% based on historical info from other real 
estate crowdfunding sites. 

�20



• In this graph we do a beta projection between 20% and 100%.

• In this graph we do a gamma projection between 12% and 20%

• In this graph we combine both projections.

�21



 • The Crowdfunding Push Fund - Floor Effect 

Thanks to our team of experienced founders and advisors, we have come up with a strategy that will 
ensure the Token price gets valued and backed by several prominent Real Estate assets from the 
start.

 1. We will use all the raised funds (80-90% depending on CAP) that surpass our defined Core 
Operating Budget (defined at page 32) as a “Crowdfunding Push Fund” to advance the 
payments for the initial acquisition of the Real Estate assets that will be offered at our 
Crowdfunding site. That will create a “floor” effect on the REAL Token price. 

 2. We will accept and keep (not sell) the REAL Tokens received as payment for the 
Crowdfunding investments in our future website during the first 12 months or until we run out 
of the Ether raised in the Token Sale. That should keep the Token price steady and growing. 

(*Note: As mentioned before, when we want to purchase a new Real Estate asset and have run out of 
Ether, we will sell the REAL Tokens in stages following a carefully planned strategy to ensure we do 
not cause a price drop. We are confident that in any case any possible drop will be compensated by 
the rise when people acquire Tokens to invest in the new Real Estate asset.)

This strategy will give enormous traction and a big boost to our Crowdfunding marketplace site which 
will heavily promote the use of the REAL Token causing its value growth. 

It will also ensure that our company will be successful, self sustainable and generate profits from year 

one in order to have stability as we grow into a successful long lasting company.  

No currency can guarantee absolute stability, but we believe that the REAL Token is an asset that is 
designed to increase in value by design. Because the base price of REAL will always be linked to the 
revenues generated on our crowdfunding site, REAL Tokens will have a floor price.

 • Additional positive outcomes  

Besides from the expected usual profits of investing in Real Estate assets (rental income and capital 
appreciation) there are other positive outcomes of acquiring and investing with REAL Tokens. Let us 
outline three of those:

 1. REAL Tokens price grows X% post-Token sale prior to investing in the Crowdfunding: When 
that happens, you will benefit from a discount at the time of investing in our Crowdfunding 
marketplace and a multiplier of the ETH profit payments. The cheaper you acquire REAL 
Tokens the more profitable the Real Estate investments will be. EXAMPLE: If Token price 
grows 300%, you will invest 3 times as much as others, therefore at 300% better terms than 
others. If the Real Estate asset returns 15% annually, you would obtain 15% x 3 = 45% 

�22



 2. REAL Tokens price grows X% while invested: When that happens, you will not only earn the 
Real Estate profits but also the Token appreciation. EXAMPLE: If Token price grows 300%, 
and the property grows 15%, you will receive 15% of profits in ETH, and 300% in value gains 
when you receive your REAL tokens back. 

    3. ETH price goes down: Because you purchased REAL Tokens and they will be backed by Real 
Estate assets therefore having a floor on its price, it would increase the profit return on 
investment. EXAMPLE: If the ETH price goes down 50% of your original Token purchase 
price, you would obtain a 50% more ETH in your profit payments. 

 
Those scenarios can also happen together exponentially multiplying the positive outcomes.

Token Sale DETAILS

The launch of the REAL Token is organized around smart contracts running on Ethereum. 

Summary:
 
 • Participants willing to contribute to and support the development of the REAL can do so by 

sending ether to the designated address. 

 • By doing so contributors create REAL Tokens (REAL) at the rate of 220 REAL per ETH. 

 • It will begin on August 31th. 

 • Contribution Period will run for 14 days, or within 36 hours of the soft cap being achieved. 

 • There will be a pre-sale on the 24h of July during 24H for contributors of more than 100 ETH 
capped at 100.000 ETH. 

 • Any Token holder will be able to sell its tokens in the major cryptocurrency exchanges. 

 • Token Sale Size: There will be Soft Cap of 200.000 ETH and a hard cap of 400.000 ETH. 
Hard cap will begin if soft cap is hit within the first six hours. Explanation below.* 

 • All unsold tokens will be burned. 

 • REAL company controls the contract and the address to which gathered ether will be sent 
(implemented as a multisig address). 

 • REAL received by Contributors will be transferrable 7 days after the end of the Contribution 
Period. (7 days Cliff) 

 • Security Audits: To ensure beyond any doubt that funds will be secure, we are working with 
some of the most respected Ethereum security advisors. The results of the audits will be 
made public.

  

Our Dynamic Size: Soft and Hard Cap.

Real Estate market size is enormous and very capital intensive. We are determined to succeed and 
be the world leader. Therefore we are aiming at an ambitious strategy establishing the “Crowdfunding 
Push Fund” with all raised funds above our Core Operating Budget (defined in page 22) (80-90% of 
raised funds) to ensure our success and create a “floor” effect on the REAL Token price.

REAL Token distribution:
 

 

�30



80% of all tokens will be distributed to the public in the medium-long term. This will ensure long term 
growth of the REAL technology and Tokens.
 
a) 51% of all tokens will be distributed during the REAL Initial Token Sale.
 
b) 29% of all tokens will be retained for future reserve: They will be held in a multisig and are intended 
to be slowly distributed to contributors in the network periodically at a later date to foster growth. (see 
“Tokenomics” section). The Reserve will not be accessed for a minimum of 4 quarters (12 months), 
and will be re-locked or burned if deemed unnecessary for the growth of the network.
 
c) 20% of REAL Tokens created during the Contribution Period will be allocated to REAL Founders, 
Team, Advisors and Strategic partners over a 24 month vesting period, with a 6 month cliff. This 
means these tokens will not be immediately tradable, further aligning the Founders interests with 
executing upon the long term goals for the project.
 
Planned Token Sale Funds distribution:
 
-Defined Core Operating Budget: We have established a fixed budget for our next 5 years of 
operations. We believe this provides more transparency and avoids inflated teams and/or excessive 
development costs. 
 

 
 1. 55% Core Dev: Expansion of the REAL development team who will implement our proprietary 

functionalities. Additional industry specialists will be hired. 
 2. 15% Business Development: Generate new revenue sources, clients and partnerships. 

�31



 3. 15% Marketing: Online marketing in order to generate awareness in the Real Estate sector 
and acquiring cryptocurrency holders. 

 4. 10% Reserve: For future unforeseen costs. 
 5. 5% Legal & Compliance: Most of which will be allocated for developing a solid legal 

framework for REAL offerings; a minor part of that will go to administration/accounting. 

-Core Operating Budget projection: ETH 43,759 Calculated at 250 USD=1 ETH ex.rate. 
 

 
-Crowdfunding Push Fund: All funds raised above the Core Operating Budget will be used to 
consolidate and boost the Token value while generating traction to our Crowdfunding site according to 
page 22. That will create a “floor” effect on the REAL Token price.

LONG TERM VISION

About eight years ago, a pseudonymous cryptographer known as Satoshi Nakamoto introduced 
Bitcoin as a digital analog to gold: Limited in supply, but secured by modern cryptography, and made 
for the internet age.

 
Since then, many have tried to improve on Satoshi’s original vision, and thousands of alternative 
cryptocurrencies have been born.
The value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence, such as Bitcoin and Ether, checks in at $50-$100 
billion, slightly ahead of Bill Gates fortune. However, the market for cryptocurrencies remains very 
niche. Cryptocurrencies still have shortcomings that discourage mainstream use, in particular high 
volatility and barriers to entry. 

There are many assets in the world which people choose as a store of value, a transactional medium, 
or an investment. Blockchain is a better technology for transacting, storing, and accounting for these 
assets. Most estimates measure global wealth around 250 trillion dollars with much of that being held 
by banks or similar financial institutions. 

The migration of these assets into Cryptocurrency represents a tremendous opportunity.  

We believe that REAL will be an important milestone in the cryptocurrency world and will contribute to 
the rise of cryptocurrencies as more and more people lose faith in fiat money and other traditional 
measures of wealth 
.

�33



We believe that REAL Tokens will be more attractive than traditional Real Estate investment because 
Real Estate will become liquid with Tokenized ownership.
 
We also believe that REAL technology will enable all property-related transactions to become safer, 
more transparent and streamlined in the near future 
 
Finally, we believe the REAL Token will offer stability, security and a more precise determination of 
value and perceived risk of the value of cryptocurrency thanks to its connection to one of the best 
performing real world assets: Real Estate.

Acknowledgements 

We would like to thank everyone that participated in this Whitepaper assisting and supporting us for 
the past months. We also want to thank Satoshi Nakamoto, The Ethereum Foundation, and the entire 
Blockchain community, Mist, Metamask, Parity and MEW for paving the way over the past 8 years. 
The best is yet to come.

FOUNDERS REFERENCES

As in every Token Sale and Crypto-asset project, the most important thing is execution. Our team has 
shown in the past our ability to execute in a quality and timely manner and we are confident we will 
turn REAL into a stellar successful execution.

 • Real Estate Crowdfunding background 

Three years since  crowdfunding for real estate started, the market has grown to more than a billion 
dollar industry. By 2025, the global real estate market could be worth $90 billion or more. This is 
getting the attention of VCs. 

VC activity in the space can be measured by their investments on real estate crowdfunding platforms. 
VC’s investment in  Fundrise raised $31 million. 

The investors were led by Chinese social networking company Renren and executives from New 
York-based Silverstein Properties Inc., which owns the World Trade Center. This Series A funding 
round had  additional new investors – Guggenheim Partners and the president of Rockrose Justin 
Elghanayan – have taken the total to $38 million.
Renren liked Fundrise’s focus on community and believes that real estate is the next frontier of crowd-
based financing. Silverstein executives  were impressed on Fundrise’s vision and execution, noting 
that it has cracked the code to do real estate crowdfunding well.

Early in 2014 Realty Mogul raised $10.1 million in a funding round led by Canaan Partners which 
contributed $9 million. Realty Mogul has already invested more than $70 million in 226 different 
properties located in 19 different states.

Hrach Simonian, partner at Canaan Partners, notes that VCs have invested in the platform  because 
the public is now participating in crowdfunding sites. Another reason for investing is the  data build up 
on these platforms,which can be used to predict assets’ performance.

Addressing the needs of an underserved market not met by banking solutions | Pixabay.com
A platform for borrowing and investing in commercial real estate, AssetAvenue  raised $3 million in 
2014 from investors led by Matrix Partners and NetEase. Matrix backed powerhouses such as Apple 
and JustFab, while NetEase is one of the largest publicly traded companies in the internet and 
technology space in China.

Josh Hannah of Matrix Partners notes that real estate crowdfunding platforms are addressing the 
needs of an underserved market not met by banking solutions. In   2015,  the platform  raised an 
additional $11 million from DCM Ventures and from earlier investors, NetEase and Matrix Partners.

DCM Ventures’ General Partner, David Chao believes that AssetAvenue can change the commercial 
real estate landscape in terms of how lending is done.

Other notable  local and overseas fundraising participated by VCs include:

-RealtyShares raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Menlo Ventures, which also incorporates 
participation from the previous investor General Catalyst.
-California-based platform Patch of Land raised $23.6 million in a Series A round, which SF Capital 
Group and Prosper participated.
-UK-based Property Partner, which gives investors the opportunity to invest for as little as £50 in the 
flourishing UK buy-to-let housing market, raised £1.25 million in seed capital from Octopus 
Investments,  and VC Jon Moulton, founder of Seedcamp and Better Capital.

These successes  indicate that real estate crowdfunding is going to be a force to reckon with in the 
future.
