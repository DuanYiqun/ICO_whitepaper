1. Introduction

Anryze Distributed Network is a peer-to-peer distributed computer network 
for speech recognition and neural network education would allow users to 
transcribe audio files without reliance on a third party provider like Google or 
Amazon. The removal of central controls would mitigate most traditional data 
failures and provide the highest accuracy of a speech transcription due to neu-
ral networks education through distributed system.

Over the past 50 years people tried to make computers understand  human 
language in order to make them more responsive to our needs and helpful, 
and to create a bigger amount of useful features. Starting from Bell Labs and 
IBM experiments, the most sufficient value in speech recognition was intro-
duced by Google with the innovative Speech API. But all these solutions were 
built on the principles from 50 years ago and soonly will reach their limits. Thus, 
now it is time to embrace the brand new solutions and take computer speech 
recognition on the next level.

Why speech recognition matters? As soon as we educate computers to under-
stand natural human language, it will become a revolution in a different areas 
of work. Developing, educating, and creating new neural network models is 
vital nowadays, because of the possibility to make computer actually think like 
a human being. The accurate speech recognition is the very first step to it. After 
all, this is how we communicate. Our mission is to create the best Speech Rec-
ognition System: highly educated, thinking like us, understanding all our words 
and intention, and while doing that, we want to get as much people as we can 
to participate. Afterwards, we will be proud to say that this is the collaborative 
act aimed on the education of the Computer that became possible not only 
due to the efforts of the small group of scientists but also with the contribution 
of usual people. We want them to feel as a part of this revolutionary process.

2. Speech Recognition

Basic Concept

Speech is a complex phenomenon. People rarely understand how is it pro-
duced and perceived. The naive perception is often that speech is built 
with words, and each word consists of phones. The reality is unfortunately 
very different. Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished 
parts. It’s always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of 
the speech and listen to it. 

All modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That 
means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between 
words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are nev-
er 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who 
usually work with deterministic systems. Therefore, it creates a lot of issues 
specific only to speech technology.

Structure of speech

In current practice, speech structure Anryze use as follows:
Speech is a continuous audio stream where rather stable states mix with 
dynamically changed states. In this sequence of states, one can define 
more or less similar classes of sounds, or phones. Words are understood 
to be built of phones, but this is certainly not true. The acoustic proper-
ties of a waveform corresponding to a phone can vary greatly depending 
on many factors - phone context, speaker, style of speech and so on. The 
so-called coarticulation makes phones sound very different from their “ca-
nonical” representation. Next, since transitions between words are more 
informative than stable regions, developers often talk about diphones - 



5Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

parts of phones between two consecutive phones. Sometimes developers 
talk about subphonetic units - different substates of a phone. Often three 
or more regions of a different nature can easily be found.

The number three is easily explained. The first part of the phone depends 
on its preceding phone, the middle part is stable, and the next part de-
pends on the subsequent phone. That’s why there are often three states in 
a phone selected for speech recognition.

Sometimes phones are considered in context. Such phones in context are 
called triphones or even quinphones. For example “u with left phone b and 
right phone d” in the word “bad”. It sounds a bit different from the same 
phone “u” with left phone b and right phone n” in word “ban”. Please note 
that unlike diphones, they are matched with the same range the waveform 
as just phones. They just differ by name because they describe slightly dif-
ferent sounds.

For the computational purpose it is helpful to detect parts of triphones 
instead of triphones as a whole, for example, to create a detector for a 
beginning of triphone and share it across many triphones. The whole va-
riety of sound detectors can be represented by a small amount of distinct 
short sound detectors. In general we use 4000 distinct short sound detec-
tors to compose detectors for triphones. We call those detectors senones.  
A senone’s dependence on context could be more complex than just left 
and right context. It can be a rather complex function defined by a deci-
sion tree, or in some other way.

Next, phonemes build subword units, like syllables. Sometimes, syllables 
are defined as “reduction-stable entities”. To illustrate, when speech be-
comes fast, phones often change, but syllables remain the same. Also, syl-



6Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

lables are related to intonational contour. There are other ways to build 
subwords - morphologically-based in morphology-rich languages or pho-
netically-based. Subwords are often used in open vocabulary speech rec-
ognition.

Subwords form words. Words are important in speech recognition be-
cause they restrict combinations of phones significantly. If there are 40 
phones and an average word has 7 phones, there must be 40^7 words. 
Luckily, even a very educated person rarely uses more than 20k words in 
his practice, which makes recognition way more feasible.

Words and other non-linguistic sounds, which we call fillers (breath, um, 
uh, cough), form utterances. They are separate chunks of audio between 
pauses. They do not necessarily match sentences, which are more seman-
tic concepts.

On top of this, there are dialog acts such turns, but they go beyond the 
purpose of the document 

Recognition process

The common way how Anryze recognizes speech is the following: we take 
the waveform, split it on utterances by silences then try to recognize what is 
being said in each utterance. To do that we want to take all possible com-
binations of words and try to match them with the audio. We choose the 
best matching combination. There are few important things in this match.

First of all, it is a concept of features. Since a number of parameters is 
large, we are trying to optimize it. Numbers are calculated from speech 
usually by dividing speech on frames, then, for each frame of length typ-
ically 10 milliseconds we extract 39 numbers that represent the speech. 



7Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

That’s called feature vector. The way to generate numbers is a subject of 
active investigation, but in simple case it is a derivative from spectrum.

Second, it is a concept of the model. Model describes some mathematical 
object that gathers common attributes of the spoken word. In practice, 
for audio model of senone is gaussian mixture of its three states; to put it 
simple, it is a most probable feature vector. From concept of the model the 
following issues are raised: how good does model fits practice, can model 
be made better of its internal model problems, to what extent the model 
is adaptive to the changed conditions.

The model of speech is called Hidden Markov Model or HMM, it is a gener-
ic model that describes black-box communication channel. In this model, 
process is described as a sequence of states which change each other 
with certain probability. This model is intended to describe any sequential 
process like speech. It has been proven to be really practical for speech 
decoding.

Third, it is a matching process itself. Since it would take a long time to com-
pare all feature vectors with all models, the search is often optimized by 
many tricks. At any point, we maintain best matching variants and extend 
them with time, producing best matching variants for the next frame.

Models

According to the speech structure, three models Anryze used in speech 
recognition to do the match:
An acoustic model contains acoustic properties for each senone. There 
are context-independent models that contain properties (most probable 
feature vectors for each phone) and context-dependent ones (built from 
senones with context).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model


8Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

A phonetic dictionary contains a mapping from words to phones. This 
mapping is not very effective. For example, only two to three pronuncia-
tion variants are noted in it, but it’s practical enough most of the time. The 
dictionary is not the only variant of mapper from words to phones. It could 
be done with some complex function learned with a machine learning al-
gorithm.

A language model is used to restrict word search. It defines which word 
could follow previously recognized words (remember that matching is a 
sequential process) and helps to significantly restrict the matching process 
by stripping words that are not probable. Most common language mod-
els used are n-gram language models-these contain statistics of word se-
quences-and finite state language models-these define speech sequences 
by finite state automation, sometimes with weights. To reach a good accu-
racy rate, your language model must be very successful in search space 
restriction. This means it should be very good at predicting the next word. 
A language model usually restricts the vocabulary considered to the words 
it contains. That’s an issue for name recognition. To deal with this, a lan-
guage model can contain smaller chunks like subwords or even phones. 
Please note that search space restriction, in this case, is usually worse and 
corresponding recognition accuracies are lower than with a word-based 
language model.

Those three entities are combined together in an engine to recognize 
speech.

What Anryze optimized

When speech recognition is being developed, the most complex issue is 
to make search precise (considering as many variants to match as possible) 



9Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

and to make it fast enough to not run for tremendously long periods of 
time. There are also issues with making the model match the speech since 
models aren’t perfect.

Mostly the system is tested on the test database that is meant to represent 
the target task correctly.

The following characteristics are used:
** Word error rate.** Let we have original text and recognition text of length 
of N words. From them the I words were inserted D words were deleted 
and S words were substituted Word error rate is

WER = (I + D + S) / N

WER is usually measured in percent.

Accuracy. It is almost the same thing as word error rate, but it doesn’t count 
insertions.

Accuracy = (N - D - S) / N

Accuracy is actually a worse measure for most tasks, since insertions are 
also important in final results. But for some tasks, accuracy is a reasonable 
measure of the decoder performance.

Speed. Suppose the audio file was 2 hours and the decoding took 3 hours. 
Then speed is counted as 1.5xRT.

ROC curves. When we talk about detection tasks, there are false alarms and 
hits/misses; ROC curves are used. A curve is a graphic that describes the 
number of false alarms vs number of hits, and tries to find optimal point 
where the number of false alarms is small and number of hits matches 100%.

Comparison Test with Google and IBM

Methodology of testing the recognition system.  
Speech recognition systems used for testing:

• MS Azure
• Google Speech
• IBM Watson
• Anryze STT V.b0.53

For testing the following characteristics were applied:

• 3 male voices
• 2 female voices
• Seperate speech (there is a pause after every word)
• Conjoint speech
• Generals topics
• Special word usage (there are international names,  

scientific and technological etc.)



11Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

Tests description:

1. 1 speaker, conjoint speech, general topic 
2. 1 speaker, separate speech, general topic 
3. 1 speaker continuous speech, special words
4. 1 speaker, separate speech, special words
5. 2 speakers, conjoint speech, general topic 
6. 2 speakers, separate speech, general topic 
7. 2 speakers, conjoint speech, general topic
8. 2 speakers, separate speech, special words 

Prior to testing, we have prepared 10 different text sets for each character-
istic (separate speech, monologue, dialogue, special words etc.)

Testing process

Each speaker have read out particular texts according to test type. Record-
ings were made in record studio in order to get clean sound. After record-
ing sound files were converted into appropriate formats for each recogni-
tion system on tests. With the API results were obtained.

Technologies description

While developing Anryze STT we have applied following technologies and 
solutions. Here are some of them:

• Wavelet transform - allows to improve recognition by reducing loss of data.
• Recognition using fractal code descriptor - reconstructing the signal while 

any sampling frequency.
• Multi-Objective Learning for Deep Neural Network Based Speech 

Enhancement - responsible for constructing extended speech signals.



12Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

• Invariant Representations - increases the stability of acoustic variability.
• Highway Connections in Convolutional Recurrent Deep Neural Networks  

is an extension of the CLDNN model by integrating connections that 
provides a direct stream of information from the cells of the lower layers to 
the cells of the upper layers. 

• Recognition with the use of distributed capacity – allows to reduce 
equipment costs and obtain resistance to changing loads. 

• Acoustic models based on long short-term memory – is a recurrent neural 
network architecture that has been designed to address the vanishing and 
exploding gradient problems of conventional RNNs

3. Decentralized Network

Anryze is a decentralized worldwide fog computer for AI (speech recog-
nition) purpose. Anryze computing power exchange is the free market, so 
malicious hubs and users will shortly be ignored by buyers and miners 
due to their bad reputation. We expect Anryze to be the smartest, cheap-
est and largest decentralized computing system due to self-learning in-
telligent agents. Hubs retranslate tasks from users to miners. Hubs unite 
miners and distribute tasks among them. Priority is given to miners with a 
better connection to hubs servers and with bigger computing power.

1. User app detects suitable hub (based on access speed and apparent 
capacities).

2. Form smart contract and pay for service
3. Start data transfer.
4. After several minutes user receive transcribed speech in text format.

In case user upload a prepared audio file, the request is processed in the 
hub server and then data transfers to the miner. If user uses audio stream, 
data stores on hubs servers the same time retranslating stream to miner.  
It ensures the system against possible loss of data in the event of a connec-
tion failure.

4. Product

Anryze Distributed Network is a next generation speech recognition plat-
form that enables real-time voice recognition alongside with traditional re-
quests. 

The Product consists of 2 parts - Miner’s part and User’s input plugin.

User’s input plugin is a web application and API solution where the user 
decides to upload audio through web browser or upload directly from his 
server through API.

After files are uploaded, Network Monitor analyzes the audio, calculates 
number of minutes, and finds the best suitable miner.

5. Market

The problem is that most communications between people happen over 
the voice and even if somebody records the voice - you need to spend the 
same amount of time to understand what they were talking about. So a lot 
of data is just recorded and stored. 

Speech recognition brings a huge value for people and businesses be-
cause text is easy to analyze.

The global voice recognition market size was valued at USD 51.09 billion 
in 2015 and is expected to grow at 11% yearly. 

The adoption of voice-enabled applications for mobile devices and other 
smart voice-enabled consumer products is increasing the scale of the con-
sumer/mobile category, challenging the traditional voice technology en-
gine of growth, namely contact centers. Legal compliance issues will con-
tinue to ensure the healthcare sector’s dependence on voice recognition 
solutions that can help the industry meet electronic medical record (EMR) 
standards while providing efficient healthcare.

In the enterprise and healthcare sectors, voice recognition technologies 
are allowing physicians, soldiers, and other users to accomplish more by 
reducing the time consumed by written communications. The military sec-
tor, the industry’s largest investor, uses the technology to increase opera-
tional efficiency and for precision driving. North America remains the lead-
ing market in that sector, nonetheless, Asia-Pacific countries are rapidly 
increasing their market shares.

7. Monetization

1. Anryze Distributed computing power based on blockchain charges us-
ers for transcribing a certain time of the audio file. Therefore, users pay for 
service, miners (computing capacities) get tokens, and token holders with 
Anryze get commission.

Miners get 70% of tokens in exchange for computing power, other part 
goes equally to Anryze and token holders (10% and 20%). If the demand 
on service will be bigger than capacity, the price of tokens on the exchange 
will rise.

Anryze gets tokens from transcription to develop our network, introduce 
voice verification and other AI services. While token owners get them as 
compensation for their investments.

2. Each minute of the processed audio is equated to a token. We use 
the market price model, so the current cost of a minute will depend on 
transcription demand and mining supply in a system and also on token 
demand and supply on the crypto exchange. Initially, the rate will be 



22Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

1:1 (one minute for one token) and 1:0,01 (one token for $0,01). As the 
quantity of tokens is limited and in the nearest future it would not be able 
to meet transcription demand, so the price of the token will rise the same 
as the number of the minutes per token. Such model will provide greater 
demand and reward investors. Tokens can be bought on ICO or after ICO 
through crypto exchange. 

Basic market price model:

Where: 
D_n-demand in n-period; S_n  - supply in n-period; P_n-price in n-period
α,β,γ - Coefficient of adaptation / base increase; B_n-budget in the period



23Anryze Distributed Network ico.anryze.com

The charts below show the forecast of the cost of tokens and minutes  
(The x-axis indicates the volumes of transcribed audio in millions of minutes)

The real price of transcrip-
tion (minute per USD) will 
be volatile but thanks to the 
market mechanism, a high 
price increases supply and 
reduces demand, which 
leads to lower prices, and 
vice versa

While amount of tokens is 
limited, transcription vol-
umes will rise which due 
to market will increase de-
mand for tokens and their 
price as well.

High prices for tokens will 
not affect transcription 
costs, therefore user can 
transcribe more minutes 
per 1 token. Price for one 
minute in token will de-
crease.

8. ICO

Anryze is planning to raise between $1 – $3 million USD in the next round of 
financing by selling tokens. This money will help to accelerate market penetra-
tion and product development.

Anryze is an official service provider and crowd-funding initiator.

A special token (RYZ) will be created on the Etherium Platform for crowdfunding.

Soft cap: 180 million RYZ  

Hard cap: 330 million RYZ

The initial rate will be 1 USD =  100 RYZ. 

The expected amount of tokens to be offered is 330 million RYZ* (an addition-
al 6,6 million RYZ will be issued for the bounty program, and 15 million RYZ 
will be issued to the option pool for rewarding current and future employees. 
These tokens cannot be sold for the next 12-month period and will be under 
lock contract). Total amount of tokens will be 353 300 000  RYZ tokens.

The tokens will be sold at a discount to early buyers at the rate sliding from 
150 RYZ tokens per $1 to 100 RYZ tokens per $1. Exchange rates are shown 
in the table below:

Tokens will be sold through several currencies in the equivalent of Ethereum

The creation of new tokens will stop after an equivalent of $3 million USD 
is raised or after the ICO expiration date.

All unsold tokens will be distributed among all investors in accordance 
with their deposits.

No new tokens will be created after ICO. 

All money raised will be exchanged for Anryze distributed network audio 
transcription or sold through crypto exchange. 

In the case of fund raising less than the planned smart contract will refund 
all money back to investors

9. Escrow

All money raised will be deposited to an escrow account. Management 
will be able to access this money only if a minimum of $1 million USD or 
more is raised. 

In the case of fund raising less than the planned smart contract will refund 
all money back to investors. In any case, our team will continue to develop 
the product and introduce it to the market.
