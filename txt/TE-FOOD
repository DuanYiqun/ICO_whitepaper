1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

TE-FOOD is a successful farm-to-table livestock and fresh food traceability solution, focusing on 

emerging markets. Since 2016, TE-FOOD has been implemented in Vietnam. As a farm-to-table 

solution, TE-FOOD tracks the items through the whole supply chain (farm, slaughterhouse, 

wholesaler, retailer) and provides tools to consumers, supply chain companies, and authorities to 

gain food history and food quality insights.  

TE-FOOD has grown to over 6000+ business customers, tracking 12,000 pigs, 200,000 chickens, and 

2.5 million eggs daily. In 2018, it will be extended to track cattle, fish & seafood, and fruits & 

vegetables.  

Foodborne diseases around the world are accountable for the hospitalization of 700 million people 

and 400,000 deaths annually. The global food traceability solution market will reach $15.1 Billion by 

2021. Compound Annual Growth Rate is highest in Asia-Pacific (CAGR: 16.7%) vs. rest of the world 

(5.5-8.7%).  Effects of traceability are medical (fewer foodborne illnesses and deaths), social 

(consumer demand, need for trust), and economical (decreased product recall costs, supporting 

export, transparency, increased VAT revenue). 

TE-FOOD provides physical identification tools, mobile and web based software solutions in a PPP 

model (low or no upfront fee, and long term contract). TE-FOOD charges for the identification tools, 

the data transactions made in the system, and custom services. Our customers are governments, 

private companies, and professional organizations.  

TE-FOOD is optimized for emerging markets. Despite it uses modern technology, it’s the cheapest 

solution available, with no need for special equipment. The business model fits emerging countries, 

making it a profitable business.  Our detailed, practical implementation guide ensures scalability in 

other countries.  

TE-FOOD is a joint project of a Hungarian and a Vietnamese company, currently employing 30 people. 

For international expansion, all rights and activities will be incorporated into a new single company: 

TE-FOOD International Ltd.  Leaders of the new company have over 20 years of business and IT 

experience.  

To pre-sell tokens which can be exchanged for services within the system. Our main plan for 2018 

is international market expansion. We have detailed roadmap to launch TE-FOOD in 17 countries 

within 5 years. Blockchain provides transparent trust based solution for international

3. MISSION 

 

Since 2015, we have been developing TE-FOOD as a centralized traceability solution. As we had been working 

with companies of the food supply chain, we had to realize that the trust among consumers, supply chain 

companies and authorities is completely lost.  

The industry is so full with debates, lawsuits, corruption, and scams, that even data coming from a third party 

like existing traceability system seems suspicious to the participants. 

We started to think how to solve this problem, to bring back trust in food related information. We needed a 

technology which ensures that the food related data can not be corrupted or modified in any way.  

This led us to blockchain.   

TE-FOOD is introducing a utility token called TFOOD, blockchain protocol, and smart contracts that creates a 

trusted transaction ledger to integrate consumers, supply chain participants and authorities in one ecosystem. 

 

TE-FOOD’s mission is  

• to make food industry more transparent  

• to democratize the access to food related information as a common property 

• to enable technology to become the „authority” 

• to reduce the scale and effect of epidemics and food frauds in emerging countries 

all around the world 

• to educate people through incentivizing conscious consumer behavior 

• to help small farms to be more competitive

4. SOCIAL PROBLEMS TO SOLVE 

 

Food safety 

 1 in 10 people gets ill each year from foodborne diseases. 

 Lack of food safety processes result in the death of 400,000 people, mostly children  
under age 5.  

Antimicrobial resistance, overuse of antibiotic drugs 

 Common overuse of animal antibiotics caused the emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections, 
which totals $20 billion in health care costs each year only in the U.S. 

 By 2050, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can cause low-income, developing countries to lose 
more than 5% of their GDP and push up to 28 million people into poverty. 

Economic inequality 

 Food sector is the most affected industry by economic inequality. 

 Employees in agriculture among lowest earners. 

Migration caused by climate change 

 Climate change has the biggest negative impact on the agricultural sector. 

 Migration caused by climate change is a growing threat to a lot of emerging countries, which 
has serious global impacts. 

Food frauds, mistrustful supply chains 

 Public sector corruption takes out $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion annually from the global economy 
in the form of bribes and costs far more in stunted economic growth, lost tax revenues and 
sustained poverty. 

 Food frauds have serious economical impact of $55B. 

Low VAT revenue, high VAT rates 

 In a lot of developing countries it is very hard to follow the real quantity of retail transactions, 
which results in high VAT rates on legal trading to compensate the loss. 
 

 

 

Implementing a modern, cost effective food traceability solution can make the difference, but it’s a 

road full with obstacles and pitfalls. To successfully implement such a system needs commitment, 

determination, cutting edge technology, and tremendous competence.

5. CURRENT STATUS OF TE-FOOD 

 

TE-FOOD is a livestock and fresh food traceability solution, currently implemented in Vietnam, the third 

largest country in Southeast Asia with 94.5M people. 

TE-FOOD enables all companies of the fresh food supply chain to manage logistics and food safety 

related data in their operations. Identification tools of various technologies are applied to livestock, 

transports, and fresh food packages to follow the items throughout the whole supply chain. Fresh food 

products in retail can be traced back to their origins together with food safety related information. 

 

 

 

The basic process of the fresh food supply chain can be decomposed to a series of activities. The roles, 

activities, and their input / output data can vary in different categories, and in different countries. TE-

FOOD's modular structure enables us to easily customize the process flow, and its data requirements 

according to the requirements. 



  

9 
 

 

This diagram shows the process flow for pigs, but in TE-FOOD each food category has its customized 

process. Authority control can be embedded to any part of the process. 

Connecting the physical and digital goes by reading the QR codes with the TE-FOOD mobile app, to 

read/write/update data about a tracked item. 

Additional features: 

   

Food safety alerts 
Food safety alerts are built into 
the whole process, and can be 
triggered by certain events. E.g. 
if a livestock transport takes 
longer than the average, can 
trigger an alert to the 
veterinary at the receiving side 
to check the transport as it can 
be suspicious. 
 

Reputation system 
An internal reputation scoring 
system helps supply chain 
participants to rate their 
connected suppliers through 
their common business 
transactions.  

Supporting conscious 
consumer behavior 
TE-FOOD provides a mobile app 
for consumers to check the 
history and food quality 
information of food products, 
and provides incentives to use 
it frequently.

5.1.2 B2B mobile app  

 

TE-FOOD provides a multilingual mobile admin app, optimized for 
low-end phones. 
 
Using the app is role based, each role (e.g. farm, slaughterhouse, 
etc.) has its own processes, menus, functions. The functions focus on 
  

 Logistics transactions - sending and receiving transports, 
verifying information provided by the previous step 

 Food safety information - providing weight, feeding, 
vaccination, etc. information 

 Identification tool management – inventory and ordering of 
identification tools and transactions 

 Authority tools – functions of the supply chain enforcement 
for the authority (e.g. governmental veterinaries, police) 

 
The mobile app uses the phone's camera to read 1D/2D barcodes to 
identify items (livestock, transport, food product) as part of 
processes. 
 
 
 

 

5.1.3 Back office tools 

 

Standard interfaces 

TE-FOOD is open towards companies with third-party logistics or traceability 
solutions. Traceability information can be sent to the system through standard 
interfaces. Supply chain companies which have their own identification tools, 
can request identification serials through an API. 
 

 

Reporting tools 

Supply chain participants automatically get daily, weekly, monthly reports 
with tables and charts about their activities.

5.3 Farm management tools 

Status: partly ready (working modules: inventory, feeding, vaccination) 

 

To help improving the competitiveness of smaller farms, we 
provide an easy to use, mobile app based farm management 
application, which is integrated into the TE-FOOD B2B app.  
 
Currently the farm management tools consist of the core modules 
(inventory, feeding, vaccination), which also help providing food 
safety data in the traceability process.  
 
We plan to broaden the functionality of this app to reinforce the 
engagement of farms, and help them operating a more sustainable 
business. 

 

5.4 Livestock registry 

Status: under development, release at Q4, 2017 

 

 

As part of the food safety tools provided to authorities, 
our livestock registry and management solution 
enables national or local authorities to get certain 
regular status reports from farms. From basic livestock 
inventory information to sales and export reports, the 
system provides wide range of information. To provide 
the necessary data, farms need to download an easy to 
use mobile app, or connect their systems to our API. 
 
In the 2nd phase, the system will be extended with AI 
based smart pandemic forecasting and alarming 
modules, to provide authorities tools to prepare for, 
and to limit the effects of potential outbreaks.

6. OUR PLANNED SOLUTION 

Current status 
 

 

Planned developments 
 

 
 
 

Please note that TE-FOOD is a ready solution with tokenized transactions. The planned developments 

are here to provide information on the project for potential users. 

We plan to replace the current, decentralized transaction ledger with a blockchain based structure. 

We also plan to extend the current functionality of the system, which will have great impact of the 

sales possibilities of TE-FOOD: 

Decentralized transaction ledger  Gain additional credibility by a blockchain based 
transaction and food information ledger. 

Food safety sensor tools Mitigating supply chain debates by measuring and 
logging the environmental conditions of transported 
livestock and food. 

Marketplace Gaining new markets and improve engagement by 
providing B2B livestock and fresh food trading 
possibility for the supply chain. 

Extended food categories Gaining new markets by extending TE-FOOD to track 
and trace cattles, fish/seafood, fruits/vegetables, and 
animal antibiotics. 



  

15 
 

Animal face recognition Gaining new markets by enabling the identification of 
cattles without any physical identification tool. 

6.1 Blockchain utilization 

Status: tokenization is ready, blockchain transaction ledger is planned 

6.1.1 Why TE-FOOD needs blockchain? 

 Because the data provided by the supply chain participants must be unmodifiable. Due to the 
significant distrust and suspiciousness among consumers, supply chain companies, and 
authorities (caused by several food frauds and corruption), only technically unalterable 
logistics and food quality data can provide credibility. 
 

 Because the data in the system is a common property of all participants. It must be stored in 
a shared, distributed ledger to provide transparency. 
 

 Because the food safety related data all over the world is a property of all us, and data 
accessibility must be public and democratic. 
 

 Because the economic inequality is one of the largest social problems and we need a 
technology which helps to create a fair access to data,  know-how, and income.   
 

 Because corruption is a global economic problem, and the food sector in emerging countries 
is one of the most affected sectors. Incorruptible food history information leads to transparent 
food supply chains, which can make a difference in public health, and literally save lives.   

 

  

“If you’re buying some food or medicine, for example, you have this 

complex global supply chain…  Ideally, you’d want to have some 

kind of common shared network that you could use to get all the 

information about where each individual thing came from so you 

could trace every part of the product back to where it came from. 

 

You could have a smartphone app that you could check everything 

about the product and see if it satisfies your needs. To do this kind 

of thing, you need to have a shared network and the blockchain is 

a great way to do it.”

16 
 

6.1.2 Ecosystem structure 

 

6.1.3 Integrating all participants 

TE-FOOD, with the tokenized financial transactions will enable us to equally integrate supply chain 

participants, authorities, and consumers into the process.  

  



  

17 
 

6.1.4 Blockchain structure 

Blockchain will be implemented for two purposes: 

 Token transaction ledger 
The token payment solution will be implemented on a public network using TFOOD, an ERC20 
token. 

 Traceability transaction ledger 
Transactional and food related information will be stored on a private blockchain, and will be 
driven by an internal technical token: the Transaction token. 

 

Supply chain companies will have  

 a TFOOD wallet on the public network, which can be accessed directly or through the TE-FOOD 
mobile app 

 a Transaction wallet on the private network, which can be accessed by the TE-FOOD B2C 
mobile app.  

6.1.5 Utility token 

According to the utility token types by William Mougayar, TFOOD will have more utility types: 

 Toll: To use TE-FOOD’s blockchain traceability ledger, supply chain participants will need to 
pay for transactions using the token. 
 

 Value exchange: There is a lot of information provided by certain type of supply chain 
companies, which is valuable for other supply chain companies. (Example: if and when a calf 
was treated with vaccines or antibiotics is a valuable information for the cattle farms which 
buy the calf. Normally they don’t have this information, and they needlessly treat the animals 
with vaccines and antibiotics. This can lead to overuse of antibiotics. If they can get this 
information for a cheap price, the cattle farm can avoid the redundant activity, thus saving 
money. This income goes to the information provider (the calf farm).) 
 

 Value exchange: Consumers get tokens as reward for using the TE-FOOD consumer mobile 
app in retail, reading the QR code and viewing the food history, this way, the system incentives 
conscious consumer behavior. 
 

https://medium.com/@wmougayar/tokenomics-a-business-guide-to-token-usage-utility-and-value-b19242053416


  

18 
 

 Value exchange: Consumers can use the tokens to order food analysis services. They package 
a part of the food product and send it to TE-FOOD, and they got the results of the food analysis 
in electronic format.  
 

 Right: Token holders can rate supply chain companies with which they are in connection, so 
the system can maintain a supply chain company scoring system. 

6.1.6 Token supply 

Before the token sale, 1 billion tokens will be generated. 

 Public token pool: 500 million tokens will be in the public token circulation (400 million offered 
in the public sale, 100 million to marketing, proof-of-care, advisors, cafeteria pool). 

 General reserve: All remaining 500 million TFOODs will be held in a General reserve. 

As the number of TE-FOOD customers grow, they will require more transactions, thus, more tokens. 

At the same time, certain participants of the ecosystem will staking tokens, and some wallets are lost 

or forgotten, which will limit the supply. 

TE-FOOD doesn’t want to endanger the core activities of TE-FOOD, that’s why in certain times, we 

maintain the right to release tokens to the market from the General reserve beyond the 500 million 

limit. However, the released excess amount will be justified by the need for the tokens in the 

circulation. Finally, when TE-FOOD grows further, all 1 billion tokens will be on the market, which we 

believe will be sufficient for long time operation. 

6.1.7 Token economy 

 

  



  

19 
 

Buying traceability transactions 

1. Supply chain participants indicate the number of transactions they want to buy in the TE-FOOD 
B2B app. 

2. To cover the cost of the desired number of transactions, they can buy TFOODs for fiat money 
or ETH on the Exchange, and store it in their TFOOD wallet. 

3. The smart contract automatically  
a. deducts 10% of the TFOOD tokens, and 

 9% is exchanged to transactions on a fixed exchange rate for supply chain 
reimbursement (See the Reimbursements process),  

 transfers 1% to the TE-FOOD Consumer Rewards wallet, 
b. exchanges the tokens to transactions on a fixed exchange rate, 
c. the remaining tokens are distributed to the solution provider. 

4. On the private blockchain, TE-FOOD deposits the purchased transactions to the supply chain 
participant’s Transaction wallet. 

Reimbursements 

1. Each time a supply chain participant buys transactions, 9% is exchanged to transactions on a 
fixed exchange rate for supply chain reimbursement. 

2. Daily once, an algorithm selects the supply chain companies to share the tokens. 
3. On the private blockchain, TE-FOOD automatically deposits the transactions to the selected 

supply chain members’ transaction wallet. 

Paying for value added information 

1. Supply chain companies (value providers) can set a price / item on specific food related data 
they provide. 

2. If other supply chain companies (the buyers of the value providers) want to obtain those 
information, a smart contract 

a. deducts the total price (value added information price multiplied by the actual number 
of the received tracked goods) from their TFOOD wallet,  

b. transfers the TFOODs to the value provider’s TFOOD wallet.  

Rewarding conscious consumers 

1. Consumers check the TE-FOOD tracked food product’s QR code using the B2C mobile app. 
2. A smart contract automatically transfers a pre-specified amount of TFOOD tokens from the 

TE-FOOD Consumer Reward wallet to the Consumer’s TFOOD wallet as reward. 

Selling tokens 

1. Supply chain participants and consumers can sell their excess tokens on the Exchange for a 
desired rate. It creates a selling offer on the Market. 

2. Buyers can buy tokens on a desired rate, when they match, the deal is written in a smart 
contract. 

3. The seller’s TFOODs are transferred to the buyer’s TFOOD wallet.  

6.1.8 Transaction ledger 

Due to the fact, that data stored in a country-wide food traceability system is extremely sensible from 

a governmental viewpoint, we assume in most cases, storing transactional data on a public blockchain 

network will not be acceptable for governmental customers. 



  

20 
 

The blockchain layout differs from the traditional public ledger network model, for the planned 

solution is heterogeneous based on real world business logic. The protocol will route it's mesh 

network not on traditional IPv4 or IPv6 methods like kademilla, but use existing business logic called 

"contract routing". Rhyno Technologies is by default part of this contract routing as per the EULA, 

and additional partners interacting with the smart-contract framework can find other partners based 

on this mesh network. 

While self-marketing takes place with known blockchain paradigms, business logic requires private 

information retrieval that will be implemented using quantum safe lattice cryptography and zero-

knowledge transactions as seen in EIP207 and EIP760. 

Having a heavily USD-backed marked, interpolability with the utility token is a must, which will 

happen transparently for end-users, putting the exchange mechanism under the same consensus 

model for the USD market as seen for the token itself. 

Data storage shall make use of decentralized storage to mitigate redundancy, where nodes can only 

store hashes known to not fall into their contract scope using bloom filters. This way we remove 

interest in unpinning sensitive data for doing so will ruin business reputation outside of the 

consensus model too. 

Instant transactions for existing industry solutions where fee handling and block time acceptance is 

not an option, we offer a lightning network/tumblebit solution for instant off chain transactions, 

while preserving all guarantees of the network.

6.2 Other planned developments 

6.2.1 Food safety sensor tools 

Status: prototype is ready 

 

For fresh food, the environmental conditions of transportation are 
crucial for food safety.  
 
We plan to develop a special hardware product, which can be built 
in transportation vehicles and transportation boxes to measure 
these environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, time 
interval, geolocation), log them directly to blockchain, and build an 
analyzer layer to send alerts when pre-set conditions are violated.  
 
This tool provides proof if the food is kept in appropriate 
conditions during transportation. 

 

6.2.2 Marketplace 

Status: planned 

TE-FOOD already covers all logistical and food safety aspects of the supply chain. To broaden the 

possibilities of companies, we plan to extend it with trading related data (e.g. pricing, inventory, 

contractual conditions), to create a virtual livestock and fresh food marketplace which enables easier 

matching of buyers and sellers as well as wizard based contracting with automated conditioning (e.g. 

quality or transporting conditions), and escrow based payment. 

 

6.2.3 Animal facial recognition 

Status: planned 

 

Physical tags for animal identification are the most popular tools 
in traceability. However, their procurement and application on 
the livestock mean a continuous cost for the farmers. But until 
now, there was no other solution. 
 
The radical improvements in artificial intelligence driven image 
recognition during the last years, and the availability of cheap, 
but good quality cameras created an opportunity for a new 
identification approach. 
 
In cooperation with Meat and Livestock Australia, we will develop 
a face recognition system to identify cattles from a digital photo.

7. IMPLEMENTATION IN VIETNAM 

 

 

The implementation of the system was done by TE Ltd., a Vietnamese 
company as contracting partner of the government of Ho Chi Minh City. The 
system combines mobile technology and a cloud based central system with 
cost effective identification tools.  
 
TE-FOOD’s implementation in Vietnam was all over the news.

7.1 Advantages of TE-FOOD 

Credibility  
Introducing blockchain to provide an incorruptible, 
unalterable ledger, combined with a smart food 
safety alert system creates trust among consumers, 
authorities, and supply chain companies.. 
 

Cost effectiveness  
To keep costs down, TE-FOOD doesn’t require to 
use costly equipment, or enterprise integration. 
The cost of tracking an item (e.g. a pig) can be as 
low as $1 throughout the whole chain. 
 

Methodology  
We have a top-to-bottom implementation roadmap 
for emerging markets, which describes how to 
organize, train, communicate such implementation. 

 

Consumer involvement 
We provide a mobile app, and a token based 
motivation system to consumers to act more 
consciously when shopping for fresh food. 

Pragmatism  
Changing processes of the supply chains need time. 
TE-FOOD doesn’t require to disrupt current 
contracting or payment methods. It extends them 
with trusted technologies. 

Reimbursement 
Supply chain participants can get reimbursements 
for providing more food safety information. This is 
important to make farms committed to provide 
proper traceability data. 
 

Interoperability  
Whole-chain approach and general standards (GS1) 
provide interoperability beyond borders, and the 
opportunity for participants to mitigate common 
redundant actions (e.g. double vaccination) 

Customized approach  
TE-FOOD can be used as a full-scale tracking 
solution as well as a transaction ledger on top of 
an existing traceability or ERP system. In each 
case, we configure the system to follow the 
custom elements of the customer’s processes. 
 

Flexible business models  
TE-FOOD can be implemented by a government or 
institution in a B2G model, or by companies (e.g. 
food producer) in a B2B model. 

Flexible financing models 
TE-FOOD is implemented in a PPP (Public Private 
Partnership) model, which requires minimal 
investment.

9.1.3 Target markets 

 

TE-FOOD’s primary target markets are the emerging countries. The reasons: 

 65% of the food frauds, foodborne illnesses and deaths happen in the emerging countries 

 In many emerging countries, corruption is very strongly  present in food supply chains, and is 
a major obstacle in making supply chains transparent. However, there is a strong will in 
governments to make this industry cleaner, which gives a strong regulatory background. 

 Supply chains in emerging countries lack any form of a traceability system. But they have the 
opportunity to skip several stages of technological advancement. They simply leave out DOS 
based applications or Excel, and jump from paper based transaction register directly to 
blockchain based, mobile app driven operation using QR codes. 

 Growing middle-class in emerging countries, and increasing awareness among population 
drives growing demand for consumer level product history insight. Our technology and 
implementation methodology fits perfectly in the needs of emerging countries. 

 Emerging countries represent 60% of the world's population and 45% of its GDP. 

9.2 Market analysis 

9.2.1 Difficulties of the food traceability market 

Difficulty Solution 

Long implementation time (6-
12 months) 

The funds raised on the token sale shall provide liquidity during 
implementation. 



  

30 
 

Face-to-face trainings require a 
lot of resource and 
organization 

We have large experience in building training teams, and 
organizing their work efficiently. 

Authorities need a lot of 
consultations 

We will provide a written guidebook and efficient consultation 
services to help authorities in their implementation tasks.    

Finding local leaders in target 
countries is a tough task 

We will put huge effort into the recruitment of the leaders in the 
target countries, and offer them convincing incentives to 
motivate them.   

 

9.2.2 SWOT analysis of TE-FOOD 

 
 

Strengths 
• One of the largest traction 
• Whole-chain approach 
• Cost-effectiveness, as TE-FOOD is the cheapest solution on the 

market 
• Practical implementation methodology through experience 
• TE-FOOD ecosystem with a wide range of synergistic tools and 

applications 
 

 
 

Weaknesses 
• Lack of international awareness 
• Lack of funds for expansion, because our business model needs 1-2 

years for ROI 
• Few existing sales channels in the emerging countries 
• Distance between the company leaders 

 
 
 

Opportunities 
• Food safety becomes an important development area in emerging 

countries 
• Growing middle-class in emerging countries, and increasing 

awareness among population drives growing demand for consumer 
level product history insight 

• Food scandals became well publicized, which drives authorities to 
tighten regulations 

 

Threats 
• Government dependency (in governmental implementation) 
• Lot of conflicting interest (because of frauds and corruption) can 

affect implementations 
• Technological issues, and lack of best practices regarding blockchain 

cause uncertainty 
• Cryptocurrency regulations (or the lack of regulations) can affect 

target markets

9.2.3 How we plan to overcome the weaknesses 

Lack of international 
awareness 

We are planning yearly 10-12 exhibition presence, 20 conference 
attendances, and for the first 3 years, a lot of targeted B2B and 
B2A marketing activities. We already exhibited on three trade 
fairs and our experience shows that government and media 
representatives are open to the topic of food safety, and accept 
our practical arguments. 

Lack of funds for expansion, 
because our business model 
needs 1-2 years for ROI 

Our main goal with the token sale is to raise funds to finance the 
international expansion of TE-FOOD. The funds will provide the 
necessary liquidity to implement the systems in the PPP model. 

Few existing sales channels in 
the emerging countries 

We will aggressively look for local and international partners to 
find channels to the governments and supply chain participants. 
We have convincing arguments, we just need to find the leads.  

Distance between the 
company leaders 

The co-founders know each other for 20 years. Daily 5-6 calls, 
personal meetings in every two months proved to be efficient to 
work together.   

9.3 Marketing and sales strategy 

9.3.1 Market expansion 

In most cases, food traceability is a buyer/authority driven market. According to this, the potential 

target customers/partners list are (from the most important to less important): 

 Food safety authorities 

 Trade and export authorities 

 Food producer and export organisations 

 Retail chains 

 Food safety NGOs 

 Food producers 

 Other food supply chain participants 

Drivers of traceability implementation 

Governments 

 Improving food safety and public health 

 Improving exports – an important aspect if an important export target country (like China in 
Southeast Asia) requires traceability when importing livestock and food products 

 Improving transparency in the food industry to fight grey markets, to gain more Value Added 
tax in the long term 

 Mitigating multiple use of antibiotics 

Professional organisations 

 Defending represented brands from counterfeiting 

 Improving exports 



  

32 
 

Food supply chain companies 

 Avoiding large scale recalls 

 Improving exports 

 Defending their brand from counterfeiting 

 Improving Public Relations through credibility 

 Avoiding redundant activities (e.g. double vaccination) 

For both governmental and private implementation of TE-FOOD, we give priority to target countries: 

 which export to markets which require (or prefer) tracked livestock and fresh food 

 where those multinational companies are present, which are already our customers 

 where food fraud scandals get large publicity 

 where most of the food sector is dominated by small companies, which don’t have the funds 
for expensive traceability solutions 

Current status of market expansion 

Our implementation in Vietnam got large publicity in the ASEAN region, and we had the opportunity 

to participate in some exhibitions. As a result, we have ongoing negotiations with potential franchise 

partners and representatives in: 

 Laos (Population: 7M) 

 Malaysia (Population: 32M) 

 Cambodia (Population: 16M) 

 South-Africa (Population: 55M) 

There is a great chance that the next implementation will happen in one of these countries. 

9.3.2 Local representation 

Selling and implementing a traceability system is not possible without a strong and active presence on 

the target market. We follow two roadmaps to acquire new markets: 

 Direct presence 

 Presence through a partner (franchise) 

Regarding the most important target countries, where the government is committed to improve food 

safety, and the size of the market requires huge efforts in the implementation, we will have direct 

presence, through a daughter company, a local staff.  

In other countries, and where we can acquire reliable and motivated partner company with strong 

local networks, we will work along a franchise contract to represent TE-FOOD.  

  



  

33 
 

9.3.3 Increasing sales in our existing markets 

 

According to our experience, after implementing a traceability system, the number of food fraud cases 

increases. This paradox happens because a well designed traceability system like TE-FOOD helps 

authorities to notify fraudulent activities, which earlier went unnoticed. 

When a food fraud scandal gets publicity, governments tend to tighten regulations, by broadening the 

types of animals to be tracked, the territory of traceability, the obligation of traceability use, etc. 

This gives us opportunities for market growth in countries in which we are already present. Our 

product line is built (and planned) to help this process by providing synergistic tools for an improved 

food quality control. 

At the same time, larger retail chains value the PR advantages of traceability, and are at the forefront 

of wide scale roll out after they already use it. 

In practice, this means that even a pilot project in a narrow food segment or region can lead to a much 

wider roll out within 1-3 years.   

9.3.4 TE-FOOD is scalable 

Implementing traceability systems is 40% technology, and 60% implementation methodology. Having 

a scalable, modern software system is far from enough, a reliable, feasible implementation roadmap 

is the key of success. 

We implemented TE-FOOD at more than 6,000 companies, and trained over 10,000 people within one 

year. To reinforce our international growth, we collected all of our experiences, potential problems 

and threats, successful tactics and strategies to an implementation guidebook. This guidebook 

provides a methodology which can be used and improved while implementing TE-FOOD in other 

countries.  

We will train our local representatives how to  

 help authorities in regulation, enforcement, sanctioning, 

 communicate the advantages of blockchain and tokenization to gain support, 

 analyze supply chain processes, and find the way to align them with TE-FOOD’s approach, 

 communicate and gain support from professional organisations, NGOs, and the local media,  

 realize successful pilot projects, which lead to program roll out, 

 organize and perform the trainings for thousands of companies, 

 organize and manage the logistics of identification tools, 

 monitor the commitment of supply chain companies, and act if there is a glitch, 

 fine tune built-in food safety alerting and forecasting mechanisms to get the best results. 

Our technology, experience, and this practical guidebook are all keys to an internationally scalable 

solution.

9.3.5 Sales model 

Governmental implementation 

Authorities or governmental organizations implement traceability for a group of companies. The scope 

can be geographical, or industry category related (e.g. pig, fish). Participation can be voluntary or 

mandatory. 

For governmental implementations, our sales model is based on the PPP (Public-Private-Partnership) 

model, which means 

 No implementation cost (except creating the feasibility study and customizations) 

 No training cost 

 Long-term contract 

 Identification tool and transactional costs 

 Optional consultancy and project management services 

In this model, the organizer of the implementation is a government of a region or country, to which 

TE-FOOD provides consultation on how to implement the system (legislation, enforcement, 

communication, etc.). The implementation, training costs are covered by TE-FOOD.  

In return of TE-FOOD’s active contribution, the parties sign a long term exclusive contract. The 

customers of the system are the companies of the food supply chain. TE-FOOD provides identification 

materials, software applications, optional hardware, and transaction storage for certain fees. 

Steps of implementation:

Private implementation 

In this model, private companies (e.g. farms, food producers, retail chains), or professional 

organizations of the supply chain implement traceability for their (or their members') processes. They 

may require from their suppliers to provide data to the system by using it, or interfacing to it.  

For private implementations, as the potential traceability revenue is limited to the customer’s 

operation capacity, we charge additional fees: 

 Training 

 Development – optional, in case of system integration, migration, customization 

 Consultancy – optional 

 Project management - optional 

Steps of implementation:

9.4 Pricing strategy 

9.4.1 Basics of TE-FOOD pricing 

Pricing is based on  

 physical identification tools 
o QR code/RFID based security seals/tags – to identify tracked items, lots, cases, 

transports 
o QR code based label stickers, paper bags – to identify food products in retail  

 transactions 
o each smart contract entry and update on blockchain generates transactions 

As our primary target markets are emerging countries, the cost effective pricing is the main goal. In 

general practice, this means the total traceability cost of a tracked item can not be more than US$1. 

Tracked item means: 

 In case of high price animals/items (e.g. pig, cattle, some fish, larger crabs) it’s one animal, 
with all the meat/food products sourced to it 

 In case of medium price animals/items (poultry, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables) it’s a lot/case of 
animals/items, with all the meat/food products sourced to it. 

For example, one pig has the following direct traceability costs attached (the exact numbers depend 

on the operation structures): 

     

2 security seals 
(one on each rear 
leg) 

 

1/20th transport 
security seal  
(20 pigs in one 
transport truck) 

 

1/10th wholesale 
package security 
seal (pork from 10 
animals in one 
package) 

 

~80 label 
stickers/paper bags 
for the pork meat 

 

5-10 transaction 
entries throughout 
the supply chain 
(depends on the 
structure) 

 

All these together can’t cost more than US$1. 

Supply chain companies can either pre-pay or post-pay their transactions, depending on the 

contractual structure. 

9.5 Competition / alternatives 

Since we could not find other solutions, which provide 

 farm-to-table traceability 

 focus on livestock and fresh food 

 focus on the requirements and the possibilities of emerging markets 

 integrate supply chain companies, consumers, and authorities as well, 



  

37 
 

so we lowered the barriers of comparison to the main characteristics. 

9.5.1 Direct competitors 

We consider those solutions as direct competitors which provide farm to fork food traceability, 

regardless if they have a centralized or decentralized structure, and which provide tools for supply 

chain companies and consumers as well. 

 Characteristics: 
Provenance is a blockchain based general traceability solution, which 
provides a mobile application to follow the products from farm to fork. 
It seems they have a more generalist approach, by not customizing the 
process for animal categories and roles in the supply chain, and it seems 
they are focusing on the logistics side.  They have some implementations 
at private companies. However, we could not find their mobile app on 
app stores, so maybe they don’t provide a general consumer app, but 
white label apps under their customers’ name. 
 
Comparison: 
TE-FOOD has custom processes for each food categories, and supply 
chain roles. TE-FOOD is open towards authorities as well. TE-FOOD 
provides physical identification materials as well, connecting the physical 
and digital sides at all stages. 
Towards supply chain companies and consumers, we provide general 
mobile apps to use in their processes. TE-FOOD also focuses on fair cost 
sharing within the supply chain. 

 
Characteristics: 
Ambrosus will provide a general food and pharmaceutical traceability 
platform on blockchain to track the history, and check the quality of food. 
Their solution is still under development. 
 
Comparison: 
Ambrosus provides sensor hardware and blockchain protocol solution. 
TE-FOOD provides B2B client applications as well. 
TE-FOOD is focused on specific areas: livestock and fresh-food 
traceability, and emerging countries as potential markets. While their 
solution is planned to be operating with cutting edge technology, TE-
FOOD is probably more cost effective solution, which is important for 
emerging countries. 
TE-FOOD also focuses on fair cost sharing within the supply chain. 
 
 

9.5.2 Indirect competitors 

We consider those solutions as indirect competition, which provide food traceability for supply chain

Characteristics: 
Wabi provides product genuineness verification combined with a retail 
payment solution and loyalty system. 
Wabi is a B2C solution for baby food products, cosmetics, alcohol, 
pharmaneuticals. 
 
Comparison: 
TE-FOOD covers the whole chain from farm-to-table, providing tools for 
supply chain companies, consumers, and autorities as well. 
 

 

 

Characteristics: 
FoodLogiQ provides whole chain traceability for food producers and 
retailers / hospitality companies. They can integrate their suppliers and 
follow the logistics and food control processes throughout the supply 
chain. As far as we know, it’s a B2B solution, so consumers and authority 
are not involved. 
 
Comparison: 
TE-FOOD’s solution also integrates consumers and authorities, as they 
have specific purposes to access food supply data.  
TE-FOOD covers custom processes for each  food category and supply 
chain role. 
TE-FOOD focuses on fair cost sharing within the supply chain. 

 

Characteristics: 
HarvestMark tracks pre-packaged fruits and vegetables, and their main 
focus is to provide information to consumers at the retail.  
 
Comparison: 
TE-FOOD covers the whole supply chain as a B2B, B2C, and B2A solution 
in one. 

 

Characteristics: 
IBM’s planned Hyperledger based blockchain traceability solution for 
WalMart seems to be more a general, logistical data based solution. As 
far as we know, the solution is in development/piloting phase. 
 
Comparison: 
IBM provides only the blockchain protocol, while TE-FOOD is a top to 
bottom solution with ledger, back office, and client apps. TE-FOOD’s 
primary focus is livestock and fresh-food traceability, emerging countries 
as potential markets, and beside logistics data, TE-FOOD focuses on food 
quality data as well.   
In this regard, IBM is not a competitor, but a potential partner.

9.5.3 Alternatives 

Internal traceability 
through logistics or ERP 
systems 

Characteristics: 
A lot of supply chain companies (mostly in developed countries) track 
their items within their premises. They know from whom they bought it, 
and to whom they sold it. For a lot of companies, this information is 
enough. 
 
Comparison: 
TE-FOOD’s solution provides a new level in traceability with the whole 
chain approach. 
These companies can be partners as well through interfacing their 
solution to TE-FOOD to exchange logistical and food quality data. 

Paper or Excel based 
traceability 

Characteristics: 
In the emerging countries, a lot of food supply chain companies don’t use 
modern technology to track and trace their items.  
 
Comparison: 
It’s not possible to mitigate the current drawbacks of the food industry 
with these outdated technologies. The results which can be achieved by 
TE-FOOD is superior to these solutions.

60% Market expansion 
Since TE-FOOD as a traceability solution is ready and working, we use most of the 
revenues to acquire new markets. The sales and implementation of a whole-chain 
traceability system requires a number of professionals to work together for 8-12 
months. 
  

Our primary markets are emerging countries, which represent 60% of the world's 

population and 45% of its GDP. We already have ongoing negotiations with 

potential customers and implementation partners in Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, 

and South-Africa. 

 

According to the Financial Plan, the revenues cover the costs of expansion to 

several additional countries. To separate operational costs of the HQ and local 

companies in target countries, we counted all costs of local offices and teams to 

this package.  

 

Market expansion costs contain marketing, sales, and implementation costs as 

well. 

 Marketing: exhibitions, conferences, articles, targeted ads, marketing 

materials 

 Sales: business trips to partners and potential clients 

 Implementation: local presence in target countries 

 

 



  

49 
 

25% Research & development 
We separate funds to realize our R&D roadmap with a wide spectrum of synergistic 
tools for a modern supply chain. It contains all technical costs (e.g. server rental) and 
salaries. 
 

We calculated all technical costs (e.g. server rental) and salaries in this pool. 

 

10% Operations 
Operational costs of the HQ to enable all professionals to focus on their tasks. 

 Office rental 

 Overhead 

 Communications 

 Bookkeeping 

 Supporting personnel salaries 

 

5% Legal 
To comply with the regulations, our operation needs continuous legal help from 

professional lawyers. 

10.3.1 Release of revenues 

As a ready solution, TFOODs are immediately usable after the token sale to buy services on TE-FOOD. 

Therefore, token sale revenues are not held in multisignature escrow wallet, and immediately 

accessible for TE-FOOD International.  

 



  

50 
 

10.4 Token distribution 

 

51% Token sale (public circulation) 
51% of the tokens will be sold to the community during the public sale. 

 

5% Marketing pool 
We remunerate the proof-of-care, bounty, marketing campaign participants and 

partners with 5% of the tokens. 

Lockout period: no lockout  

 

44% General reserve 
We allocate 44% of the tokens to a general reserve.  

 

Lockout period: Two years lockout by releasing 25% after the first year. 

 

Unsold tokens will be put into the general reserve and will be sold on the TFOOD 
Market or during a future token sale until Public token pool reaches 500 million 
tokens.
