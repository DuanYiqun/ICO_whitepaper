1.1 PROCIVIS
Procivis was founded in October 2016 in Switzerland with a clear mission: To empower citizens across the globe 
by providing them with a trusted digital identity and full control over their personal data in the digital age. 
There are different ways how Procivis goes about its mission. Currently, Procivis is working with governments 
to help them issue digital identities to their citizens and residents, based on their integrated e-government  
platform called “eID+”.

With VALID, Procivis is developing a fully self-sovereign identity and personal data platform, based on “eID+” 
and backed with blockchain, which will work independently of any central authority and puts the control over 
personal data back into the hands of the individual user. 

Procivis is proud to call Switzerland home. Switzerland is quickly becoming a global center where emerg-
ing cryptography, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and businesses can thrive in a safe, 
supportive, and vibrant environment, thanks to its progressive regulatory framework, deep talent pool and 
sophisticated infrastructure. 

Some of that talent have found their way into Procivis, which is composed of a world-class team of employ-
ees, founders and advisors who jointly provide unrivalled expertise in blockchain technology, data protec-
tion, security and e-governance.

Further information about Procivis and “eID+” can be found on our website: www.procivis.ch

Initial Token Offering of VALID tokens by Procivis AG.

A digital identity and e-government services provider founded in 
Zurich, Switzerland, in October 2016. Referred to as Procivis.

Data used to describe consumers based on psychological attributes, 
such as personality, values, opinions, interests, attitudes and lifestyle.

In the context of personal data management, self-sovereignty refers 
to the idea that the individual has full control over his or her personal 
data. It also implies that individuals no longer have to rely on one 
central authority, such as governments, for the accreditation of their 
identity attributes.

 
A user is a digital identity owner that controls his or her personal data 
via the VALID wallet.

VALID is a self-sovereign, blockchain-based digital identity and  
personal data platform connecting identity owners with data 
consumers. Once completed, VALID will operate as a not-for-profit, 
peer-to-peer, open source personal data management platform 
managed by the VALID Foundation. The platform will consist of the 
VALID wallet and the VALID marketplace.

Procivis will aim to create a Swiss-based Foundation governed by 
Swiss law in 2019. 

The VALID marketplace connects identity holders and data consumers 
through blockchain smart contract technology and matches supply 
and demand commission-free.

The VALID token “VLD” is the virtual currency unit on the VALID 
marketplace.

The VALID wallet allows identity holders to manage their personal 
data in a self-sovereign manner as well as to monetise that data using 
a secure, privacy protecting platform that they fully control.

1 BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL IDENTITY AND PERSONAL DATA
Just as the information in a passport identifies its holder for specific purposes, a digital identity, 
in its simplest form, is an online proxy for a real individual.¹ It can be used to identify the individual 
for many more purposes in our digital age than would be possible with just a paper-based passport. 
These attributes can represent the obvious: given and chosen attributes such as name, last name, 
passport number, address, along with other demographic data. Less obvious digital attributes are 
preferences, opinions and attitudes (psychographic data). Collectively, this information can be 
used to create a profile of a person, with varying degrees of certainty, or level of assurance (LOA), 
that indicates whether a particular person is indeed who they say they are, thereby allowing the 
holder of that identity access to services or resources at a physical location or online.  The more 
strongly these attributes can be verified and linked to the real person, the more valuable such a 
digital identity can be to the citizens who opt to use it and to the parties who rely on it, and thus to 
the entire identity ecosystem. And just as a passport contains only a narrow set of identifying data, 
a digital identity also consists of only a narrow set of all the data related to a person (see figure 1). 
The much broader set of rapidly growing personal data available about an individual includes a lot of 
user-generated content, such as pictures and health-tracking data that can be directly or indirectly 
linked to an individual, for instance via the metadata contained within modern digital devices.

The rapidly evolving relationship between personal data and digital identity is a growing concern 
for individuals and companies alike. Individuals are increasingly worried about forgoing both their 
privacy and their ability to control who has access to their personal data and what is being done 
with this information. Companies, on the other hand, fear that mishandling the data – be it through

their own, or third-party applications – could undermine their position as a trusted provider. The 
frequency and extent of known data security breaches at major corporations around the world 
show that data theft is a very profitable business. This is also a reflection of the inherent value of 
individuals’ personal data. Hence, for digital identity systems to truly succeed and deliver on their 
promise, it is widely recognized now that a new paradigm is urgently needed.²

1.2 PERSONAL DATA TRENDS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

1.2.1 CHANGING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

In May 2018, a new European privacy regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) will come into force. It will apply to all businesses selling to, and storing personal information 
about, residents in Europe, including companies located on other continents.³ The aim of this 
regulation is to give individuals more power over their data and less discretion to the organizations 
that collect and use it for monetary gains.

For instance, under GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain confirmation from companies as 
to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. 
Further, they will have the right to a copy of their personal data being stored and processed, free of 
charge, in an electronic format. GDPR will also make it illegal for companies to promote marketing 
material to consumers without their explicit consent. Consequently, this will require companies 
to keep strict and auditable records for most of their interactions with existing and prospective 
clients.

Practically, the GDPR will have wide repercussions on the way businesses throughout Europe, and 
quite possibly beyond, handle data and their accountability for the process. The early spillover of 
this regulation from Europe to other jurisdictions is best illustrated by the new guidance issued by 
the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), stipulating that from May 2018, 
Australian businesses of any size may need to comply with the GDPR if they have an establishment 
in the European Union (EU), if they offer goods and services in the EU, or if they monitor the 
behaviors of individuals in the EU.⁴ 

While GDPR does create challenges for some businesses, it also creates opportunities. Companies 
that employ innovative, privacy-respecting ways of reaching out to customers, beyond mere legal 
compliance, are likely to build deeper trust and retain more customers than those that do not.

1.2.2 DIGITAL ADVERTISING: FAST-GROWING BUT PLAGUED WITH 
INEFFICIENCIES AND ABUSE

Individuals continue to increase their time spent using digital media, while advertisers continue 
to increase their ad budgets into digital channels. According the Interactive Advertising Bureau, 
marketers spent USD 72.5 billion on digital advertising last year, an increase of 22% from 2015, 
as Google and Facebook once again booked the lion’s share of net new revenues. In the US, the 
digital advertising industry is projected to continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 
to reach almost USD 100 billion in annual revenue, with mobile and social advertising becoming 
the top destinations, the latter expected to double in size to USD 30.8 billion by 2021.⁵ But for 
companies wanting to reach out to potential clients and who are having to budget for brand 
advertising, an excessive number of intermediaries must be taken into account. It is estimated 
that for every USD 1 spent on digital marketing, advertisers only receive 44 cents of value, the 
rest being absorbed by intermediaries.⁵ Ever rampant and fraudulent malware and other malicious 
bots are further adding to the problems currently afflicting the advertising marketplace. In 2016, 
ad fraud created by internet bots was expected to have cost advertisers USD 7.2 billion, up from 
USD 6.3 billion in 2015.⁶

1.2.3 PERSONAL DATA TSUNAMI

The volume of personal data that is generated each and every day is mind-boggling. As the 
internet economy hums along, billions of connected devices, people, and sensors record trillions 
of transactions and behaviors.

Just as remarkable is the potential value of data. When gathered, analyzed, and connected, personal 
data has the potential to reveal patterns or enable practices that can transform businesses and 
societies. As discussed above, efforts to protect privacy tend to place a premium on the consent of 
the individual – best illustrated by all the “I agree” boxes one sees online. But the prevailing notice-
and-consent approach has clear limitations: it fails to give people any understanding of, or genuine 
control over, how their information will be used.

3



1.2.4 CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

While deriving an actual monetary value for one’s personal data might still seem like an abstract 
concept, people are becoming increasingly aware that a great deal of money is being garnered from 
their personal data. In 2015, the data broker market alone amassed USD 156 billion from selling data 
that does not belong to them.⁸ But it is not only data brokers who profit, far from it. Technology 
giants, chief among them Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple, reap hundreds of billions 
each year thanks to personal data generously handed over by individuals all over the world.

Consequently, an ever-increasing number of Internet users have resorted to active avoidance of 
aggressive advertising via the installation of adblockers.⁹ But it isn’t just adblockers that are causing 
advertisers problems; they also face increasing hostility from internet users who are tired of being 
targeted with dull and irrelevant ads. Recent results from Adobe found that 27% of Brits believed 
that digital ads have “gotten worse” and 54% viewed the content as “ineffective”.¹⁰ Interestingly, 
studies show that users who are able to manage and protect their privacy are up to 52% more willing 
to share information than those who are not - presumably because they feel empowered by being 
able to adjust their data sharing activities to their unique preferences. In conclusion, individuals 
either want no ads or relevant ads that fit their preferences.¹⁰ And there lies the opportunity. And 
with recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality and their implications on the delivery 
of advertising, this need for ever more personalized and targeted advertising is set to significantly 
increase in the near future.

Figure 2 This is what happens in an Internet minute⁷

1.2.5  EMERGING SOLUTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD
A very different opportunity presents itself at the other extreme of the identity spectrum. An 
estimated 1.1 billion people in the world are unable to prove their identity, for lack of any kind 
of official physical documentation.¹¹ For most of them, it is highly unlikely that they will ever be 
able to prove their identity using conventional means, such as accredited documentation from a 
governmental body. While these individuals certainly know who they are, they are often excluded 
from property ownership, free movement, and social protection simply because they are unable to 
prove their identity.

Beyond passports and birth certificates, identities are also records of our past, and they are 
amended over time along with the events in our lives. These events constitute a historical record, 
an irreplaceable ledger that is unique to us. By fusing one’s historical records with blockchain and 
distributed ledger technology, we could very well see the emergence of credible solutions for 
those individuals lacking official identity documents.

1.3 PROCIVIS AG
Procivis was founded in October 2016 in Switzerland with a clear mission: to empower citizens 
across the globe by providing them with a trusted digital identity and full control over their personal 
data. There are different ways how Procivis goes about its mission. Currently, Procivis is working 
with governments to help them issue digital identities to their citizens and residents, based on its 
integrated e-government platform called “eID+”. With VALID, Procivis is developing a fully self-
sovereign identity and personal data platform, based on eID+ and backed by blockchain technology. 
VALID will work independently of any central authority and puts the control over personal data 
back into the hands of the individual user. 

A pilot version of eID+ will be delivered to the Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen in December 2017 
and is expected to be followed by a full roll-out of the solution to its residents during the second 
quarter of 2018. Furthermore, Procivis is also currently working on several pilot programs for its 
digital identity platform with foreign governments and supra-national organizations. It is projected 
that, by the end of 2018, a significant number of people will be using Procivis’ digital identity 
solution on a regular basis. Consequently, it is expected that this existing and fast-growing user 
base for eID+ will significantly accelerate the adoption of VALID as the next generation and fully 
compatible personal data management platform.

Procivis is proud to call Switzerland home. Switzerland is quickly becoming a global center where 
emerging cryptography, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and businesses 
can thrive in a safe, supportive, and vibrant environment, thanks to its progressive regulatory 
framework, deep talent pool and sophisticated infrastructure. Some of that talent have found their 
way into Procivis, which is composed of a world-class team of employees, founders and advisors 
who jointly provide unrivalled expertise in blockchain technology, data protection, security and 
e-governance.

2.1 OVERVIEW
Procivis, for the next iteration of its digital identity platform, intends to expand the digital identity 
sphere beyond personal attributes by encompassing the individual users entire personal data space. 
Credit card transactions, geolocation logs, browsing history as well as user-generated content are 
a few examples of personal data VALID will help users control, safeguard and share when they so 
choose. 

The VALID platform will consist of a mobile wallet (VALID wallet) for users to manage their personal 
data as well as a web application (VALID marketplace) for data consumers to buy and access that 
data. Users and data consumers, who together form the “stakeholders”, will be able to add data, 
request data from third parties, get their data verified, manage their privacy settings, buy services 
and finally share and monetize their data in a fully user-controlled fashion. This new ecosystem will 
also be decentralized and supported by innovations discussed in section 2.6 below. By delinking all 
personal information from other data-points a new level of privacy can be achieved.

Figure 4 VALID overview

7



Figure 5 VALID stakeholders shown as per type of data traded

VALID’s stakeholders have many profiles and take on multiple roles and missions. For instance, 
a credit card issuer can one day choose to directly advertise its products and services to users, 
propose a consumer survey the next or simply make an offer to a defined user pool to acquire their 
anonymized spending habits data. Finally, it can also help verifying users’ identity attributes when 
and if prompted to do so.

2.2 VALID WALLET
The VALID wallet acts as a user interface between the user’s data, the ecosystem and the VALID 
marketplace where services are accessed and data is shared.

The main features of the personal data wallet are:

2.1.1 A SELF-SOVEREIGN DIGITAL IDENTITY FOR USERS TO BE AUTHENTICATED WITH

The VALID digital identity solution is 100% owned and controlled by the user. No one else can read, 
use or take away the information it contains without the owner’s explicit consent. 

8



2.1.2 A DIGITAL VAULT TO SAFEGUARD USERS’ DIGITAL IDENTITY AND SENSITIVE PERSONAL 
DATA

As a decentralized application interacting with users’ personal data, privacy and security will be 
VALID’s number one priority. VALID users will store their most sensitive data locally on their device 
by using state-of-the-art encryption techniques and the application itself will be locked by multiple 
factors of user authentication.

2.1.3 A GATEWAY TO THE VALID MARKETPLACE WHERE USERS CAN MONETIZE THEIR 
PERSONAL DATA

Using their VALID wallet, users can opt to share and grant access to their data on the VALID 
marketplace as they see fit in a fully modular fashion. As a reward, users will be remunerated in 
VALID tokens based on the desirability of the shared data as perceived by data consumers and 
using straight-forward market-based pricing mechanisms.

2.3 VALID MARKETPLACE
The VALID marketplace is taking the concepts of personal data control and self-sovereignty one 
step further: as owners of their personal data on purchases, online browsing history or mobile 
data, users will also be able to choose whether or not to “sell” that data, with user-defined rights 
and restrictions implemented in smart contracts. To quote a Harvard Business Review’s article 
titled “Blockchain Could Help Us Reclaim Control of Our Personal Data”, this blockchain-enabled 
innovation “could shift the power of (and profit from) data management from big, established 
firms back to individual users”.¹²

Digital marketers as data consumers do not need to know people’s names, or contact details to 
run effective marketing campaigns. In fact, all they require is a certain assurance they can reach 
a desired target audience as defined by a combination of the users’ demographic data, tastes and 
preferences (psychographic data). With VALID, users will be able to pro-actively share anonymized 
demographic and psychographic data, thus enabling the creation of target audience filters on the 
VALID platform for digital advertisers to use. However, with VALID these advertisers can never 
read nor copy the information, but are simply assured that a defined pool of users correspond 
to their audience criteria and have consented to receiving advertising from them or from similar 
companies as specified by the users’ interest and preference settings.

From the advertisers’ perspective, the process is akin to marketing on Facebook and Google but 
from the users’ standpoint, the differences are significant: 

• Users will be remunerated instead of the intermediaries

• VALID, by design, will not be able to access, read nor collect any information contained in 
users’ wallets

• Similarly, companies conducting surveys and polls do not require users’ identities and, in fact, 
are most effective and least biased when users are guaranteed anonymity

VALID’s user revenue model will be a function of the following parameters: 

• The nature and reliability of data contained in users’ wallet

• The privacy settings and sharing preferences as defined by the user

• The degree of desirability of any particular dataset, as perceived and bid for by participating 
data consumers

2.4 VALID FOUNDATION
VALID will be designed as a not-for-profit, peer-to-peer platform. As such, Procivis will never be 
collecting any commissions or any kind of fees from either the transacting parties or for accessing 
the VALID platform. Consequently, 100% of revenues generated via VALID (net of blockchain 
transaction fees) will go directly to its users, in the form of token payments. Further, if legally 
permissible, Procivis will establish a Swiss-based Foundation governed by Swiss law by 2019. All 
software and applications developed for the VALID platform will be rendered open source and 
transferred to the Foundation upon testing and completion of the platform in 2021. Under the 
Foundation governance, the VALID platform will continue to be available to everybody, from 
data consumers to private individuals, for as long as they comply with VALID’s policies and ethical 
guidelines as defined by the VALID Foundation and its governing bodies.

11



The Foundation’s funding will be provided by a significant token allocation and be sustained by 
standard open-source licensing revenue models. In turn, Procivis AG, will continue to earn revenues 
from the sale and licensing of its eID+ solution to governments and semi-autonomous regions such 
as Swiss cantons. Furthermore, depending on the success of the VALID marketplace, Procivis AG, 
along with third-party service providers, intends to build value on top of the VALID marketplace, 
for instance by offering VALID wallet owners secure storage and other services that can be 
paid for with VALID tokens. Services for data consumers could also include the development of 
sophisticated analytics tools and smart contracts to optimize results from data gathering efforts.

2.5 USE CASES

2.5.1 Advertising

Thomas is a thirty-year-old business consultant on his way to Frankfurt for a two-day visit. This is 
Thomas’ first visit to Frankfurt and so he made sure he would receive relevant information and 
offers with respect to local services and city tips by opting into the relevant fields in his VALID 
wallet. As soon as he lands, two push notifications await to let him know that aside from Uber, he 
can catch a ride for almost half the price with independent local companies, one of which is called 
FRAGO. The cost of pushing a highly targeted ad to Thomas costs FRAGO the equivalent of EUR 
0.2 in VALID tokens, refunded back to Thomas. 

About two dozen hotels, all within his pre-specified price and distance range, are fiercely competing 
for Thomas’ business and are pushing him offers costing up to EUR 2 token equivalent. Ana, the 
reservation manager at a local boutique hotel, thinks it’s well worth it since her company won’t have 
to pay the 25% commission normally charged by intermediaries such as travel websites. She pushes 
the hotel’s last-minute offer to Thomas, who accepts it, and who agrees to share the requested 
information stored in his digital identity: name, last name, credit card number and contact details. 
Seconds later, his booking is confirmed. Thomas’ VALID wallet also indicates the corresponding 
token payment from the hotel. The following day, Thomas must plan for his return home. The 
airline’s online check-in application requires Thomas to confirm and share additional information 
such as his passport number. Again, using VALID, Thomas agrees and his check-in is confirmed. 

 

2.5.2 Survey

The next day, on his way to the airport, Thomas gets a call from his friend who is sounding ecstatic. 
She tells Thomas the story of how she just made 60 dollars answering a 45 minute-survey on her 
smartphone. Thomas decides to look into this innovative VALID Survey tool which promises to 
directly connect participating users and marketers without the use of third-party intermediaries. 
For one, it is user-maintained and fully self-sovereign. Users are free stay perfectly anonymous 
and can opt in or out of participating in a variety of surveys while specifically dictating the kind of 
personal attributes they are willing to share and with whom.

Because VALID’s identity platform relies on third-party attribute verifications, it can claim a high 
degree of (demographic) data reliability. And because VALID is built around data privacy and 
security by design, users don’t mind inputting their real personal data.

 

2.5.3 User-generated data

In his free time, Thomas often indulges in his passion for wildlife photography and, whenever he 
gets the chance, he goes on expeditions in the middle of nowhere to capture nature’s wonders. To 
stay on top of his game, he also exercises regularly and constantly monitors his health metrics with 

13



the latest fitness tracker he can buy. 

In fact, it so happens that his lifestyle and demographic attributes correspond exactly to the kind 
of profile his health insurance company, BUPO, is trying to sample for their new product strategy 
initiative. Because BUPO has an existing client relationship with him, Thomas receives an invitation 
to participate in a pilot project led by BUPO and in collaboration with VALID. Thomas is always 
complaining about the difficulty to find reliable and affordable international health coverage. 
Therefore, when BUPO offered the possibility to lower his insurance premiums by up to 30% in 
exchange for providing health data generated by his fitness tracker, he agreed to participate.

Some time later, he receives a notification from BUPO instructing him that he is entitled to a 30% 
reduction on his monthly insurance premiums, paid in the form of VALID tokens into his VALID 
wallet, for a minimum of six months, and until he will again need to submit a new dataset. Moreover, 
thanks to VALID’s unified platform and verification processes, BUPO no longer has to manually 
process mountains of paper-based personal information from different countries, in different 
languages and with different standards.

2.6 ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES
2.6.1 Blockchain / Distributed Ledger Technology

Blockchain consists of a continuously growing list of records, grouped in “blocks”, which are linked 
together using cryptography and together form a digital ledger. If a blockchain is used in the form of 
a distributed ledger, a blockchain can be managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering 
to a protocol for validating new blocks, which, once recorded, can no longer be altered or revoked. 
This consensus-based mechanism built into blockchain removes the need for intermediaries and 
central authorities to run the system, thereby allowing two parties who do not know or trust each 
other to transact with one another. 

Once a transaction is recorded on blockchain, it cannot be changed retroactively without also 
altering the subsequent blocks and in agreement with the network’s majority consensus. Blockchain 
is therefore immutable yet it provides full transparency as every participant can in fact audit 
everything that has ever been recorded. At the same time, participants are ensured privacy thanks 
to the pseudo anonymity shield blockchain provides. 

Over the last few years, the concepts of “private” blockchains and “hybrid” blockchains have 
become popular as they offer more options in terms of system design. In private or permissioned 
blockchains, access is limited to a defined group of members. For this reason, they are also called, 
quite simply, distributed ledgers. 

The hybrid approach involves tracking data modifications on a private distributed ledger but 
recording these changes on a public blockchain. In effect, the public blockchain in this example 
only acts as a notary for data modifications by verifying that they occurred, when they occurred 
(proof of existence or timestamping). As VALID will be handling a very significant amount of data, 
using a hybrid approach is to our current knowledge the best option to overcome the processing 
limitations of public blockchains. VALID is constantly monitoring the fast development of more 
performant Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), including built-in side-channels, more efficient 
consensus algorithms, and the reliability of various distributed file systems. Distributed Ledger 
Technology is still in its infancy and consequently, we expect major advances to take place at 
the protocol level. To deliver the best possible solution VALID remains agnostic to underlying 
blockchain and DLT solutions at this moment.

2.6.2 Smart contracts 

According to the inventor of Smart Contracts, Nick Szabo, a smart contract is a computer protocol 
intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. One key 
feature of such contracts is that they allow pseudo-anonymous parties to enter into binding 
agreements, with each participant having full transparency on the agreement being made along 
with the certitude that they will be enforced. 

15



It is in fact the algorithmic code itself that defines the rules and the penalties around the agreement, 
thus forgoing the need of a governing third party. In the case of self-sovereign digital identity 
management, smart contracts enable individuals to control and process their personal data on 
a public data marketplace. This allows individuals to choose what personal data to disclose to 
counterparties, giving businesses the opportunity to reach and interact with customers in a fully 
compliant and consensual manner, thus reducing liabilities while facilitating frictionless KYC. 

2.6.3 Cryptography

Public key cryptography is a technique that allows entities to securely communicate on a public 
network, and reliably verify the identity of an entity. Public key cryptographic systems use a 
combination of a public and a private key. The public key can be distributed widely but the private 
key is only known to its owner. Because all personal data is encrypted, optimal management of 
cryptographic keys is crucial for the overall integrity of the system. Users should be able to decide 
about the level of security he or she requires for key recovery, should it be needed. One possible 
solution involves storing key pairs on multiple devices, for instance a smartphone and a tablet or 
a PC. Another option will be to provide users with the possibility to delegate key management to 
trusted other participants where each participant has a portion of the private key. 

To ensure optimal privacy and confidentiality, VALID will be constantly evaluating advances made in 
cryptographic technologies, such a zero-knowledge proof technology (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic 
technique which allows two parties (a prover and a verifier) to prove that something is true, without 
revealing any information about what that something is. But because current ZKP systems are very 
resource intensive, VALID intends to use off-chain computing to make the technology scalable and 
fit for its most advanced uses. In addition, we will be keeping a close eye on the development of 
homomorphic encryption, a technology which allows computations to be carried out on encrypted 
data (ciphertext) without first having to decrypt it. 

Finally, ensuring the robustness of the cryptographic keys will be one of the main priorities of 
VALID.  With that objective in mind, VALID will be using Elliptic-Curve Cryptography for signature 
generation. Bitcoin, Ethereum and other lesser known blockchain solutions also use Elliptic Curve 
Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for cryptographic signatures. One of the main advantages 
of ECDSA is that it uses shorter keys for the same level of security. This is important as more and 
more cryptographic transactions are carried out on more and more mobile devices with limited 
computational power. 

2.6.4 Mobile technologies

Recent advances in broadband and touchscreen technology, computing power and the advent of 
open source operating systems like Android have all contributed to the domination and popularity 

16



of smart mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The deployment of countless apps fur-
ther increased the adoption of these smart devices. Because some of these apps store and process 
sensitive data, such as electronic wallets, they require proven security solutions. 

For these reasons, VALID will be storing sensitive information locally using a cryptographic module 
or a secure enclave in the main processor which safeguards the data it contains. In addition, inter-
actions with the end user required for authentications further expose sensitive information such as 
a PIN, password or biometric identifier to the mobile operating system. 

VALID will be incorporating innovative multi-factor authentication features, such as biometrics 
technology using fingerprint and face recognition. We also intend to incorporate a behavioral bi-
ometric security layer as this technology is now mature enough to be used in production. In addi-
tion, NFC cards could also be added to VALID’s security protocol whenever highly sensitive trans-
actions are performed on a mobile device. 

In conclusion, throughout its IT architecture, VALID will be committed to helping protect users 
with leading privacy and security technologies that are designed to safeguard personal informa-
tion.

3.1 ALLOCATION
50% of all minted VALID tokens will be offered for purchase to the public. The crowd sale will take 
place in February 2018 and stay open for 3 weeks or until the hard cap of USD 25,000,000 is 
reached.

The VALID token enables buy and sale transactions between users and data 
consumers on the VALID marketplace and provides a unit of value

1,000,000,000 - no new VALID tokens will be created

• Pool A total of 30% (300,000,000) of minted Tokens that will be held in a growth fund to 
be used to incentivize participation in the VALID ecosystem and to reward early adopters of 
the Platform

• Pool B consists of maximum 9% of minted Tokens that will be held in a reserve by Company 
for future employees’ incentivization and third-party developers with sales restrictions of up 
to 3 years

• Pool C consists of maximum 9% of minted Tokens that will be allocated to the Foundation 
(once established) to ensure its long-term funding and to enable price stability mechanisms

• Pool D consists of maximum 2% of minted Tokens that will be allocated to compensate initial 
token offering advisors and partners

• Pool E consists of maximum 50% of the total Tokens. Pool E includes Tokens to be distributed 
to purchases during the Token Private-Sale (if any), the Token PreSale (if any) or the Offering 
Period

The total number of VALID tokens sold in the ITO will always make up for 50% of all minted tokens. 
All other token allocations will be kept in proportion to the ITO allocation,  as per the above 
indicated allocation break-down.

3.1.1 Presale

As part of a presale starting in early February 2018, up to 160,000,000 VALID tokens will be 
offered to prospective buyers at a 25% discount. Oversubscribed tokens will be allocated into the 
crowd sale. Tokens sold during the presale will be deducted from the total 500,000,000 VALID 
tokens available for sale. 

3.1.2 Crowd sale

For a period of 3 weeks, starting in the first quarter of 2018, all remaining tokens will be available 
for sale according to the following discount scheme:

• First 20,000,000 tokens will be sold at 25% discount 

• For the first 24 hours of the crowd sale, tokens will be sold at a 20% discount 

• Thereafter and for one week, tokens will be sold at a 15% discount 

• The second week, tokens will be sold at a 10% discount 

• No discount will be granted the final week of the crowd sale

3.2 USE OF PROCEEDS
Procivis being incorporated as an “AG” in Switzerland, it is subject to strict financial audit 
regulations and a high degree of transparency. Below is percentage breakdown of the anticipated 
cost categories related the development and marketability of the VALID platform, estimated as of 
31st October 2017.

Salaries and development (57%) - The team consists of software engineers and business developers. 
This financing allows for the rollout of the VALID platform, including the necessary adjustments to, 
and further development of, the existing eID+ platform.

Operations (17%) - Consists of VALID sales, general and administrative costs (SGA) as well as legal 
compliance, security and infrastructure. 

Marketing (14%) - Marketing will focus on expanding awareness among users, brands and advertiers.
