 Support feasibility studies by affording analysis of patient populations, 
study sites and clinical trial design. Using this information, clinical trial study 
parameters can be adjusted to maximize the trial’s speed and cost 
effectiveness.  

 Help establish patient cohorts and inclusion/exclusion criteria to further 
support clinical trial optimization. For drugs that are designed to target a 
specific molecular pathway or gene variant, omics data can provide valuable 
information to guide the selection of patients for all study cohorts.  

 Provide insight to further classify the clinical trial population based on 
molecular signatures to ensure more targeted inclusion/exclusion criteria, 



 

which will lead to smaller study populations, thereby reducing costs 
dramatically. 

 Enable adaptive clinical trials by characterizing study cohorts, providing 
insights on drug safety and efficacy. This information will determine 
pharmacogenomic effects to support modifications to the drug dosage, 
patient inclusion criteria or clinical trial sample size.  

o Patient Recruitment: By some estimates, patient enrollment for clinical trials is 
responsible for 30% of the time it takes to conduct clinical trials; some sites never enroll 
enough patients. Shivom’s databases will have the potential to dramatically improve the 
recruitment process by connecting patients with trials in an anonymous fashion. 
Pharmaceutical or CRO organizations would have access to a treasure trove of 
information about potential participants and the users of associated investigative sites 
who are likely to be motivated to join a study. 

o Data Quality & Reproducibility: Multiple reports and studies are fueling discussions 
about reproducibility of results especially in the biomedical sciences. These discussions 
raise concerns about the level of trust in results in the scientific literature, in public 
databases, within organizations, and 
from clinical studies. The Shivom 
genomics ecosystem will be updated 
with new data, curated for the quality of 
records and made compliant with local 
regulations for genomic data handling. 
It is essential to maintain integrity, 
provenance, security and privacy of all 
sensitive information along the 
processes of data uploading, 
processing, analysis, and sharing. 
Systematizing this process will be 
essential for Shivom to dynamically 
accommodate and manage changes to 
the workflow.
