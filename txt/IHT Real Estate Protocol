I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

5. Compliance

IHT Token refers to Litecoin and other well-known encryption of digital coin, and a nonprofit 
foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

1. IHT token mechanism

IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set, accounting for 35% of the total 
tokens generated. For more information, see Chapter below. IHT total supply will be set 

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

5. Compliance

IHT Token refers to Litecoin and other well-known encryption of digital coin, and a nonprofit 
foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set, accounting for 35% of the total 
tokens generated. For more information, see Chapter below. IHT total supply will be set 

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

profitable. So, the white paper may be updated time by time to reflect the team work. The 
content in this white paper may be translated into other languages in the form of written or 
verbal communications. It may be lost or misrepresented, so accuracy cannot be prom-
ised. IHT is a continuous developing and improving platform. Many implementations will be 
constantly improved in the process of development. If there is any inconsistency with the 
white paper in the course of implementation, the specific implementation shall prevail.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set, accounting for 35% of the total 
tokens generated. For more information, see Chapter below. IHT total supply will be set 

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

5. Compliance

IHT Token refers to Litecoin and other well-known encryption of digital coin, and a nonprofit 
foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

1. IHT token mechanism

IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set, accounting for 35% of the total 
tokens generated. For more information, see Chapter below. IHT total supply will be set 

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

1. IHT token mechanism

IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set, accounting for 35% of the total 
tokens generated. For more information, see Chapter below. IHT total supply will be set 

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

5. Compliance

IHT Token refers to Litecoin and other well-known encryption of digital coin, and a nonprofit 
foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens 
which aren’t sold in the token sale will be automatically destroyed.

foundation named Public Company Limited by Guarantee in Singapore. The main task of 
the foundation is to publicly, fairly and transparently operate the state of IHT, and support 
the development team. The solution of found management and the register place will be 
chosen upon the legal advice.

6. Token risk

IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform. IHT is the digital currency that 

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.

The specific business process diagram is as follows

Examples of specific forms of operation are as follows
Roles: asset owner A   financial institution B, C, D   individual users, E, F, G
Asset owner A has 1 properties. The value is 1000W. Through releasing ATO on the IHT 
platform, the property is split into 100 shares and each value is 100K. Asset owner A sets 
up the repurchase period as 1 year and the annual return at 10%.
After the ATO is released on the IHT platform, financial institution B can underwrite 50 
shares of it, and C and D can underwrite 25 shares of it respectively.
After B underwriting 50 shares, it can package 25 shares and generate a new financial 
product. This new financial product can be named #1 and its total value is 250w. it can be 
sold to member E, F, G, on its own platform.

*IHT will not be used as the form of currency in the asset transactions. All of the transactions will be conducted under the asset's local fiat.

I. Who we are

i-house.com has been positioned as a global real estate blockchain cloud platform since 
its preparation stage. Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the block-
chain mechanism. Through joining blockchain and real estate, the real estate developer, 
financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate 
can be made a part of “digital credit society”, therefore constituting a pivotal supporting 
part of the economic development. All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of 
i-house.com real estate blockchain.

IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for 
the purpose of splitting real estate under i-house.com, which utilizes blockchain’s intrinsic 
advantages such as trustless mechanism, anti-tamper, co-supervision and traceability. 
Through IHT’s smart contract, large real estate can be split and distributed to financial 
institutions. In this way, the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money 
and benefit from real estate, and ensures security and low risk of investment.

IHT1.0 service is positioned as PaaS, Protocol-as-a-Service, which offers a standardized 
initialization and publication process for ATO ((Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners, 
acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can 
search and make deals. Meanwhile, IHT will continue progressing to 2.0BaaS, Blockchain 
as a Service, and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the con-
struction of mobile information applications for financial institutions. Finally, IHT3.0 will 
evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physi-
cal assets.

From the current situation of commercial development, the real estate developers end and 
financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm. More and more real estate developers 
and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i-house.com project, and 
look forward to the i-house.com blockchain project IHT on-line as soon as possible.

In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint, aside from real estate, all assets that have 
trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental, 
artwork, antiques and bonds.

II. IHT Ecosystem Design

IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the 
asset side and the financial institution side. Large assets can be split and distributed to 
multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract. Users, through financial 
institutions, can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract. IHT, as the center of 
the connection of two ends, cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the 
asset is split and bound, including the IHT itself. Therefore, through IHT blockchain ledger, 
it can be ensured that users’ investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets, so that 
investment is more secured and returns are more stable.

III. Development Status of Global Real Estate Market
According to Savills Global Research Report “Trends in Global Real Estate Market in 
2016”, the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion, 
which roughly equals 2.7 times of global GDP, 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 
trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets, hence rendering real estate the top 
saving and investment choice for countries, corporations and individuals.

Therefore, real estate investment can be called the most influential investment tool in 
global economy. At the same time, it is closely linked and under biggest impact of global 
currency market and investment climate.

Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most 
important part of the real estate market. Since residential property is mostly self-occupied 
properties, its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary 
people. The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its 
poor liquidity. The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly 
improved if the residential properties’ liquidity were accelerated.    

 

 

From the point of distribution of space and value, the world's real estate is unevenly distrib-
uted. The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world's real 
estate. In North America, for example, accounts for only 5% of the world's population, but 
residential value accounts for 21% of the world's total and commercial property value 
accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide. There-
fore, the use of reverse thinking, a new type of real estate investment model, is very likely 
to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Middle East 
and other regions, thereby producing a huge real estate investment market.

In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, 
blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate 
investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. 
IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via 
smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has 
pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model. It will reverse the global 
circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.

IV. IHT Application Scenarios

1. On-line Application of IHT Blockchain

Real estate transactions, in the global investment market, especially the bulk of real estate 
transactions, is facing a problem, that is how to make asset transactions light, efficient and 
transparent. In the past, only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of 
securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs.

IHT draw on traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, where the asset hold-
ers can through the early audit, risk control and prediction of asset package income by the 
third party, rapidly trade the real estate assets ownership and income rights. Through this 
process, the following advantages can be represented. First, it’s to make real estate 
investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. Second, it has very high transaction 
convenience. Third, information is transparent.

IHT has the following advantages

(1). Make real estate investment downsizing, dynamic and transparent. 
Traditional real estate transactions are all in large scale, the problem is more serious when 
encountering large offices, shopping centers, hotels, which need to be unified manage-
ment to maintain the highest value. The use of IHT platform, greatly reduces the investor's 
investment threshold of the subject. IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitiza-
tion of real estate ownership. IHT's trading platform and service platform provide the man-
agement tools needed by asset holders and investors. 

(2).High transaction convenience.
IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process. 
After the listing of the project, it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash-ability.

(3).  Information transparency.
All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain, and the books can be consult-
ed upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear, including details of asset 
operations, which can also be placed on the IHT platform to make sure the information 
transparency. The use of IHT’s smart contract platform, all of the trading matters related to 
IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records through the platform, and achieve 
investment returns are more clearly, so as to achieve assets more safely.

(4).  IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights, and shorten the listing cycle.

IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler. Using the blockchain technology of 
IHT platform, the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly. 
The traditional real estate investment tools, such as REITs, need a large number of listed 
preparations in advance, and the annual maintenance cost is also very high. All of the 
above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a 
relatively high amount limit, and it can be implemented. IHT offers relatively small terms, 
but also the possibility of asset transactions.

2.Acquire sharing economy assets
Property under the IHT’s management will be hosted by i-house.com, forming new off-line 
sharing apartment, hotel or co-working space, to form a new asset class for sharing econ-
omy. We can provide rental services, community services, property management, smart 
household services, and so on. 

With proper use of IHT, the sharing economy assets managed by i-house.com is expected 
to grow rapidly. All of these sharing economy assets will be crypto friendly and make use 
of IHT to help the payment, booking and valued services. The assets will be linked with 
Airbnb.com, Booking.com to generate income for the asset owners managed by IHT.  

IHT will expand to commercial building assets in the near future and work close with the 
blockchain startup to form a crypto friend co-working space, and the assets will be also 
managed IHT smart contract. 

Our ultimate goal is, everyone can own partial of the sharing economy assets, like hostel 
posted in Airbnb or co-working space managed by Wework, enjoy the rental income gener-
ated. This is what we called “The New Way of Asset Management”

V. Milestone

 

VI. Product Form & Design Principle
1.Usage of the IHT wallet

ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split. It is used 

to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT. All property rights 
and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset’s local fiat. 
IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO.

2. How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform?

After getting the qualification certification（proofs of legitimacy and authenticity） on the 
IHT platform, the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO.

*The above developers，real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent 
the establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

When the property developer issues ATO, it is necessary to make clear of the specific 
circumstances of the property (such as real estate, address, area, property right period 
and other relevant conditions), the sale of real estate, whether share repurchase , in a 

certain period of time, valid duration of  the subscription time  and annual effective yield.

After determining the share, before they can officially publish the ATO，the property devel-
opers need to use the IHT in the wallet to act as an inducement mechanism.

3. How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform?

After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform, they can find 
the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset. IHT 
will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets. The 
specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO.

After the completion of underwritten, financial institution can generate many sub-products 
from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display 
portal of IHT.

4. How can investors subscribe shares of ATO?

After the financial institution released sub-product on its own platform, users can subscribe 
it through the sale portal, or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of 
financial institution. The sub-product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended 
according to user's personal interest and investment ability.

5. Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform, users can obtain a number of profits：

(a)  Through transactions on the financial institution’s platform, users can obtain fiat 
profits from the real estate premium;
(b) users can gain profits from the IHT premium by trading IHT in their wallets;
(c) When a real estate developer launches an ATO，the developer will confirm an 
annual yield of the corresponding property. The user will then receive the annualized 
profits of their purchased share by the way of fiat. The specific annual yield or interest 
rate will vary on depending on each project. All of the above will be recorded on the 
IHT kernel ledger.

*The above developers, real estate and financial institutions are only for displaying, it does not represent the 
establishment of a partnership with i-house.com

6. Economy Model of cryptocurrency

 Quantity of IHT Paid by Asset Owner= (Asset Value of ATO* Percentage of service 
fee)/ Price of per IHT

Essentially, the Quantity of IHT paid by asset owner is negatively related to the price of 
IHT. When launching ATO, the platform charges 1% of the total assets value which will be 
paid by the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency IHT as a service fee. Therefore, when the 
IHT is showing an uptrend, buying IHT ahead of time is an effective way to save payment.

Expected return:
With the expansion of block chain applications to all walks of life, the application and 
demand of block chain in the field of real estate will continue to rise. As a pioneer in the 
field of property block chain, the market size of i-house.com will continue to expand. As a 
result, profits will rise as well.

VII. Technical Support：
Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by 
automated execution of “non-static, functional and quantifiable” contracts between partici-
pants. The execution environment responds to input, events, stores value, activates logics 
to drive state change, and output results to finalize contract intent.

Like a trusted escrow, it maintains temporary assets, and operates according to the con-
tractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termi-
nation.

The following diagram shows smart contract in action: a piece of code (smart contracts) 
are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated. It can maintain its state, 
drive control flow, receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to 
logic outlined in the contract.

as: 1,000,000,000 IHT. 35% tokens will be used in token sale. 1IHT=0.1USD. The tokens

drives users to use the products in the platform.

7. Project risk

The same as any project, the development and execution of our platform may have the 
risk of delay or even failure. Although the core team has a good record in research and 
development and business management experience, this is not a guarantee for success. 
The team will strive to implement milestones outlined in the project roadmap and will 
publish our progress and challenges as transparently as possible.

8. Digital coin risk

Compared with other assets (such as stocks, bonds, and even real estate), the volatility of 
digital coin is dramatic. Please do not buy IHT tokens over the amount you can accept. 
The best thing to do is to diversify your portfolio and make digital coin a reasonable part of 
your assets. This does not constitute an investment advice, purely common sense. Like 
any blockchain, please take the time to understand our projects and visions. Our goal is to 
finance from like-minded people who want to actively participate in our open research 
platform.

9. Regulatory risk

Digital currency is seen as a grey area of regulation in china. The regulatory environment 
for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development. We will do our 
utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies, but we cannot 
foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development.
In China, IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, including, but not 
limited to, real estate, finance, securities and other related laws and regulations. In the 
presence or occurrence of relevant registration, approval, filing and other procedures, IHT 
will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures. At the same time, IHT 
will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters’ restrictions 
and foreign exchange control.

In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business, IHT will comply with 
local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, registration, approval, filing and 
other related procedures.

The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract, and the blockchain tracks the 
status of each account, so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract 
execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts. The account is divided 
into an external account and a contract account. The difference is, the external account is 
associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of 
internal control encoding. The contract account is "controlled" by humans, since it is 
programmed with a specific address of the external account, and human the user who 
holds the private key to control access to the external account and indirectly to the contract 
account.

IHT asset exchange smart contract, based on the above smart contract principles and 
framework, is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform.
