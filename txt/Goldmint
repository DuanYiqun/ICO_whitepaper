1. INTRODUCTION 

Of all the precious metals, gold is the most popular as an investment. 
Investors generally buy gold as a way of diversifying risks, especially 

through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. The gold market  
is subject to speculation and volatility as are other markets. Compared  
to other precious metals used for investment, gold has the most effective 
safe haven and hedging properties among a number of countries. 

Gold’s relative scarcity, its portability (you can carry small bars, coins or 

jewelry), and its great demand in industrial applications, make it a highly 
desired commodity.   Cryptocurrency has adopted some of gold’s benefits 

with the creation of a bitcoin that is scarce: through the introduction of  
a digital coin that can be easily and effortlessly transmitted and by the 
creation of a distributed, decentralized blockchain that aids business. 

Cryptocurrency also adds value by making one's transactions fast, secure 
and transparent.  

!2



Recent cryptocurrency startups have succeeded in integrating physical 
gold into the blockchain.  Gold has always been a difficult asset to move. 

People would have to buy gold blocks and place them into a secure vault. 
The process was clumsy, laborious, slow, expensive and vulnerable to 

hacking, among other problems.  The blockchain makes the process quicker 
and easier helping to protect your gold, slashing expenses, allowing the 

asset to be moved effortlessly across borders, all the while shielding your 
investment from theft and loss.  

The following is the GoldMint blockchain solution for protecting — and 
using — your gold in a way that is simple, secure and effortless.  

GoldMint premises: 
GoldMint gives you a cryptoasset (called GOLD) whose value is based on 

Gold. This asset runs on a decentralized blockchain and provides the 
following benefits:  

• It serves as a type of futures contract in that there is a legal 
agreement to buy or sell the gold at a predetermined price  
at a specified time in the future. 

• You can hedge cryptotrading risks.  
  

If you invest in gold, you’ll find that GOLD benefits you in the following 

ways:  

• GOLD helps you use your gold-backed investments as credible 
collateral. 

• You’ll be able to trade gold quickly and easily. 
• You’ll gain higher returns from your gold funds as bullion prices rise. 

GoldMint developers have a long history of working with gold and 
cryptocurrency. They also possess the marketing, programming, logical, 

technical, and operational skills needed to accomplish this project. 

By now miners have extractef more than 60,000 tons of gold from the 
earth, half of which finds its way into the pockets and accounts of 
«ordinary» people. Our idea is nothing short of revolutionary: we plan  
to convert this gold into blockchain-encrypted tokens to help owners 
protect their valuables, to help investors move their gold rapidly and easily 

from one part of the world to another, and to help companies and 
individuals hedge their gold against market volatility.  

!3



We plan to move in three stages:  

1. To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tons) by 
launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops 

around the world. 

2. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing 
Custody Bot to shopping centers. 

3. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more 

than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot 
for popular installation.  

In this way, we predict that in five to seven years, gold will be stored in, 
traded, and invested by automated vending machines, and that our GOLD 

cryptoasset will become the trading unit for these operations.  

2. ABOUT GOLDMINT 

2.1. WHAT IS GOLDMINT? 

GoldMint runs on a blockchain ledger and works through a digitized 
cryptoasset called GOLD  whose cryptocurrency value is based on physical 1

gold. The decentralized platform uses a special blockchain that helps gold 
owners trade, loan, invest in and, generally, use their commodities for profit.  

GoldMint buys, sells and repurchases GOLD at the current market price for 
physical gold.  The company uses exchange-traded funds (ETF) or physical 
gold (of 999 quality) as its security. GoldMint’s gold reserves equal or 

exceed its mined amounts of GOLD. 

Differences between GoldMint and other gold cryptocurrency blockchains 
include the following: 

• GoldMint uses its own blockchain and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD 
transactions.  

• GoldMint uses Proof-of-Stake where miners are doled out blocks/ 
transactions according to the amount of MNT they have. Proof of 

stake (PoS) is faster, simpler and cheaper than proof of work (PoW). 

 What is GOLD1

!4



• Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized 
storage unit. 

• Custody Bot  — GoldMint’s  innovative storage unit is programmed 2
to automatically identify and store gold jewelry, small ingots (up to 
100 grams) and coins, without human intervention.  

The characteristics of the GOLD cryptoasset include the following: 

● 100% transparency of information about all Gold owned by 
GoldMint, disclosing the company’s gold reserves and its ability to 

buy back GOLD at its current trading price.  

● GoldMint uses the decentralized blockchain for smart contracts and 
for harboring its cryptoassets 

● GoldMint uses ETF  for liquidity and elasticity. ETF helps you trade 
gold much faster than physical gold does 

● A secured loan may contain gold, like jewelry or coins. GoldMint 
helps you store this collateral in its unique Custody Bot. 

● The ability to receive passive income as market price of GOLD rises. 
● Buyback of GOLD for fiat according to the current price of GOLD. 
● A fast user registration system and identification. 

The GoldMint platform includes: 

● Its own blockchain that uses GOLD and MNT cryptoassets. 
● Programmed safe deposits — namely, Custody Bot. 
● Application Programming Interface (API) for building application 

software and for helping software components interact. 

2.2. TARGET MARKET  

● Crypto traders —  These participants can use GOLD for hedging 
cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD 

can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat.  

● Standard investors — These investors may want to buy GOLD  
as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. 

● E-commerce and self-employed individuals — GOLD can be used 
to pay than for goods and services. Its low volatility as an asset and  
its predictability make it an invaluable form of currency.  

● Banks — GOLD cryptoassets give banks new opportunities. There is 
free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat 

and vice versa. The use of cryptocurrency has become a major 
industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, 

commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash 

 Robotic storage unit Custody Bot2

management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD 

reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also 
earn commissions from participating in the GoldMint partner 

program.  

Today, overall cryptocurrency circulation has exceeded $700 billion a year 
and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more 5%.  

In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, 
most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch 

from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time, the 
integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other 

cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly.  
Banks also have revenues from cash management and commissions 
charged for stored gold owned by GoldMint company. Another source of 

income for banks is revenue from the partner program which includes 
adding GOLD digital assets to the product line of the bank’s department of 

wealth management. 

3. GOLD: ITS APPLICATIONS 

The following sections provide some applications of how you can use 

GOLD cryptoassets. Of course, GOLD can be used in many other ways. In 
some cases, you’ll want to use blockchain to protect or record your 

transactions, while at other times you’ll want to connect to GoldMint’s API. 
You’ll use customer relations logic in all other situations.  

3.1. SAVINGS STORAGE  

GOLD cryptoassets can be stored long-term in a special and secure storage bot with 

options of either converting the gold to fiat or to some form of cryptocurrency, such as 

BTC, ETH, Dash, etc. GOLD uses the current price of gold set on the LBMA Gold Price, so 
its market value fluctuates accordingly.

3.2. GOLD SECURED LOANS 

All members who have GOLD receive GoldMint partner banks credit cards, 

aligned with VISA and MasterCard systems.  

The GoldMint team has already launched a special bank card called 
«Bogatstvo» (MasterCard/Maestro system) for prominent pawnshops like  

«Blago» and «Fianit» which function in Russia. 

Process: 

1. GoldMint loan applicants transfer their GOLD as collateral  
to a certain GoldMint application. 

2. The rate of the loan is established at the time of issuance and 

remains fixed through the loan period. Applicants must  consent to 
GoldMint loan terms prior to receiving the loan. 

3. Applicants are given various options for loan repayment and for 
mode of repayment. 

4. If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to 

GoldMint. 

5. Credit card limits are set according to the value of the user’s 
GOLD. These cards can be used for payment in shops, restaurants 

and cafes. Interest is accrued on unpaid credit debt. If this remains 
unpaid, GOLD reverts to GoldMint. 

3.3. DISCOUNTS ON PURCHASING  
PHYSICAL GOLD  

Process: 

A customer transfers his GOLD cryptoassets to the company's trust 

management for a certain number of months. It allows to acquire physical 
gold with a solid discount which we will consider as X%.  
Simultaneously, GoldMint uses Custody Bot to lend to parties for Y% per 
year through pawn shops all over the world.  
Interest on trust management is paid in GOLD.  
The amount payable to the customer at the end of the period is the 
following:  

!7

https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=ru&prev=_t&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://fianitlombard.ru


SUM = (1 + (X / 12) × T) × Q where the number X (i.e., x%) is set by 

GoldMint based on market conditions. 

  Example: As of August 2017, the parameters would be X = 10%, Y = 

28% per annum, and T = 1 year. This means that GoldMint receives 
28% per year, an annual discount 10% which the customer can use for 

purchasing physical gold. 

The customer’s GOLD's cryptoassets are converted into fiat or crypto 
currency, while W% of the received amount (for example, $80) are 

transferred to a pawnshop for T months at Y% per year. 

A maximum 4% of the remaining GOLD will be invested on the CME Group 
stock exchange in Q amount of CALL options with an expiration date of T 

months on the Central Strike and Mini-Gold futures. Thus, GoldMint hedges 
itself against volatility and guarantees a 100% return of funds in T months 
with specified interest rate. 

  Example:Joe buys one Gold Call Option and one Mini-Gold futures, 

giving Joe a total of 1.1 ounce position of gold. Joe hoards his gold 
(via GOLD) for T months on GoldMint and either does or does not 

convert this gold in USD fiat or cryptocurrency. If he does convert in 
USD fiat and this fiat declines, GoldMint still receives the GOLD at 

current market value along with the interest accrued for interval T at 
the rate of X. 

After T months, the pawnshop that received the loan has two alternatives: 

 1. It returns the trust in full with Y%. GoldMint converts this fiat into 
GOLD and returns the loan to the customer with X% of discount for 

physical gold. 
 2. The pawnshop defaults on the loan. GoldMint uses the collateral 

stored in its Custody Bot. It mines its corresponding value in GOLD 
and returns the asset to the customer on the agreed date. 

Note: X,Y parameters are determined by GoldMint and published on the 

company’s website.

3.4. GOLD EXCHANGE FOR GOLD 

GoldMint helps you convert gold into GOLD cryptoassets and reconvert 

these GOLD assets into gold to facilitate border crossings. Carrying gold 
from one country to another can be problematic and frequently results in 

additional expenses and possible interrogation. By converting your gold 
into GOLD, you not only avoid this aggravation, but you retain 100% of the 

value of your gold at journey’s end. 
All applicants need to go through GoldMint’s KYC procedure. 

3.5. HEDGING CRYPTOTRADING RISKS 

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the 
government, tend to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools. 

Today, a significant number of investors prefer to use gold to hedge against 
inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold has become the 

common investment for all metals having a legendary history as both a 
commodity and as coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro 

and macro economic and political events, resulting in a value that 
fluctuates with these events.  GoldMint helps you cushion the risk of this 

volatility as well as giving you the option of taking a short position in 
physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks. 

Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint: 

● You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so 
protects your gold from bear market conditions. Investors can chose to 

convert any portion of their assets with this GOLD cryptoasset. 

● Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess 
whether or not they profit. 

● GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more 
face value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. 

The gold market/gold returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors 

hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

3.6. USING GOLD FOR ICOS 

GoldMint helps ICO who use GOLD hedge their risks in declining markets 

by providing guaranteed return and value of their money. 

4. GOLD CRYPTOASSET AND 
MNT INTERNAL TOKEN DETAILS  

Here’s how GoldMint uses its GOLD crypto asset and its internal MNT 
currency. 

GOLD MNT

Description Cryptoasset. Cost and 

buyback are 100% based  
on LBMA price of gold.

GoldMint’s cryptocurrency is 
used to confirm GOLD 
cryptoasset transactions.

Emission Depends on how much 

GOLD is needed but 
never exceeds the total 
cost of gold in GoldMint’s 
reserves.

Max. 10 000 000 MNT

Exchange 
rate

Emission: 1 GOLD = cost 
of 1 ounce of gold on 
stock exchanges + 5% 
commission for fiat-
GOLD-fiat – no more than 
4% 

ICO: 1 MNTP (MNT pre-
launch) = 6-8 USD  

Cost will be determined by 
the cryptocurrency 
exchanges

Buyback: 1 GOLD = cost 
of 1 ounce of gold on 
stock exchanges +  max. 
5% 
commission for fiat-

GOLD-fiat – no more than 
4% 

!11



Application Depends on the 
agreement described by 

GoldMint company 

PoS: Amount of MNT 
determines amount of GOLD 

transactions.

Features Value depends on 
amount of gold in 
reserves/ circulation

Growth of MNT depends on 
turnover of GOLD.

Emission Amount of mined GOLD 
depends on (a) validation 
of deal/ details stored in 
the blockchain and (b) on 
authenticity and value of 
gold inspected by 
Custody Bot

MNT is emitted once in a 
limited supply.

Destruction GOLD assets are 
destroyed in case 
physical GOLD is 
withdrawn from the 
custody / Custody Bot.

MNT tokens cannot be burnt

Purchase and 
sale

People who want to trade 
GOLD for fiat or 
cryptocurrency need to 
undergo  
GoldMint’s KYC 
procedure.  

Resale of GOLD occurs 
on stock exchanges or as 
direct transaction 
between parties.  

Goldmint platform 
executes GOLD deals.

MNTP (MNT pre-launch) is 

initially released via ICO, after 
which MNTP tokens can be 
traded on Ethereum platform 
for internal MNT tokens 

(found only on GoldMint’s 
platform), using a 1/1 course. 

Max. MNT/MNTP tokens on 

either GoldMint or Ethereum 
can never exceed 10 000 
000 at any given time.

4.1. GOLD 

GOLD is a crypto asset issued by GoldMint that uses the current price of 

gold set on the LBMA exchange  at the time of sale. 3

GOLD: Its criterion 

● Equal to one ounce (31,1035 grams) of gold (999 quality) 
● Shards into 100,000 parts. 
● Commissions are given in GOLD. 

4.1.1. GOLD EMISSION 

Process: 

Information is transmitted to the blockchain ledger about the number of 

ounces of physical gold or ETFs owned by GoldMint. 

ETF is bought on the stock exchange NYSE Arca and subsequent 
information is publicized on GoldMint’s decentralized blockchain, making it 

transparent and open to all members. Statements are received from the 
depositary (electronic or printed). 

All physical gold owned by GoldMint exists in the following forms: 
a. Manufacturer-certified bullions  

b. Gold coins 
c. Gold jewelry 

d. 999 quality granules, stamped by manufacturer 
Physical gold is locked-up in storage and rated according to its value: 

e. Moody’s -  A2 and above. 
f. Standard & Poor's - A and above. 

g. Fitch - A and above. 

All ratings are confirmed by bank statements which are encoded in 
blockchain by uploading relevant forms in IPFS  to the blockchain, thereby 4

recording ownership of the gold to GoldMint. These documents let the 

system check that GoldMint company owns X amount of gold. 

This X is checked by an auditor from GoldMint. This number is verified each 
month by an objective TOP 100 audit company. 

Inspection confirms that the total number of GOLD cryptoassets in all 

wallets (Y) is less than the total number of X ounces of gold on the balance

sheet. 

Once done, the blockchain emits X-Y = G number of GOLD cryptoassets to 

the GoldMint company wallet. 

GOLD users are  provided with a separate link (www.GoldMint.io/
transparency) that contains copies of all GOLD transactions as well as the 

total amount of assets that GoldMint owns. 

Members can upload and edit their forms however many times and 
whenever they wish. 

If the audit results show that, the number of X is less than the number of 
the Y, the excess amount of GOLD will be written off automatically from the 
company wallet via the smart contract. 

All GOLD records and assets are stored in the IPFS, a peer-to-peer 

hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. This 
gives it a sort of immutability where users can check the records of their 

transactions and gain security from knowing that these important 
documents are locked in the blockchain ledger forever. The transparency of 

the blockchain makes records open to all viewers.

of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a 

common stock on a stock exchange.  

These types of investments have been around since 1993, but large scale 
use began about a decade later, when investors found them to be cheaper 

and better than mutual funds. Investors also discovered that ETFs offer 
low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options. New ETF launches 

number from several dozen to hundreds in any particular year 

The three most popular ETFs  are «Spiders» (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), 
«Diamonds» (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and «Qs» or «Qubes» (ticker 

(NASDAQ:QQQ)). 

A similar demand for ETFs sprung up among commodity assets, 

particularly gold.  In 2006, Barclay's Bank introduced ETF for gold, ETN 
(Exchange traded notes) and ETC (Exchange traded commodities).   

Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . 

The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per 

annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of 
investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the 

stock price of the three largest ETFs — the GLD (announced expense ratio 
0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) — we estimate that the real 

backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from 
COMEX on the LME ). Commissions and broker commissions are taken into 

account in calculating our commissions for GOLD. 

4.1.1.2. GOLD AS AN INVESTMENT 

 

As an example, the AmsterdamGold dealer as a depiction of the European 
market for gold. AmsterdamGold was founded by Willem Middelkoop in 

2008 and quickly developed into the most successful full-service bullion 
dealer in the Netherlands and the largest bullion storage in Europe.  

Look at his prices, and you’ll see that the South African Krugerrand and 

bars 1-20 grams cost the most, while gold coins like the Canadian dollar 
that weighs 1 troy ounce, and bars 1 troy ounce- 100 grams cost the least.  

In fact, some of these items may cost less than their inherent gold content, 
since retail prices are updated less frequently than are quotes on physical 

gold.  In any case, you can clearly see that markup is close to zero, leading

us to conclude that the spread on operations with ingots is minimal (not 

more than 1%), although never disclosed by dealer. 

It also seems to us that if you want to profit, your best bet would be to buy 
bars weighing 1 troy ounce as well as coins like the gold Canadian dollar. At 

the same time, you may want to buy old and freshly minted coins that were 
never owned by anyone. 

When it comes to laws of transporting gold from one country to another, 

you are alright as long as you carry a small amount/ volume of gold 
(usually up to 500-600 g), since you are not charged extra. If you want to 

export/ import more than that, you usually need to hire the services of a 
specialized cash collection company, like Brinks, to insure safe 
transportation. Tax usually ranges 1%- 4% of the cost of the transported 

goods (if the amount in question is not about industrial volumes).

Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo the KYC 

procedure  .  5

Cost of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA + 5%. 

Buyers who pay with VISA/MC card or via PayPal are charged standard 
commission for payment systems. 

4.1.3. GOLD BUYBACK FOR FIAT CURRENCIES 

GoldMint company guarantees any number of GOLD cryptoassets buyback 
for fiat according to the following system: 

1. Buyback price for one GOLD equals one ounce of gold of 999 quality 
on the LBMA + Q%  (1 < Q < 5). GoldMint updates prices in real time 

on its site. In case money is assessed to MC/VISA credit cards or 
PayPal, standard commissions of these payment systems are 

charged. 
2. GOLD (that corresponds to physical gold in any of its forms) is stored 

in a GoldMint wallet. This GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from the 
GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is burnt to recieve 

fiat from banks. GoldMint sends this fiat to the client.

4.1.4. GOLD COMMISSION 

GOLD commission is Z% (no more than 0.3%), but no less than a fixed  
Y amount of GOLD (i.e., more than 0,0025 GOLD depending on the current 
gold price).  

4.2. MNT 

MNT refers to GoldMint tokens. It is used as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) 
consensus algorithm. The more MNT a person has, the more blocks he can 
validate and add to the chain. Miners may get as much as 75% in GOLD 

commissions for validated transactions. 

● Miners who have too little computational power to validate their 
blocks or are unable to fulfill their duties, are removed from the 

White List of reliable miners and lose their rights to mine. The 
responsibility of validating blocks goes to another member chosen 

by GoldMint calculations. 

● To become a validator, you simply need to download the GoldMint 
Wallet app from the official website and launch it using your 
GoldMint account. 

● Users with a significant amount of MNT who have too little 
computational power can rent computational power from other 

miners. 

● Members can own no more than 10,000, 000 MNT tokens. 
● Owning MNT does not imply rights to participate in company 

management of GoldMint nor does MNT represent a share in 

company partnership. 

● MNT tokens holders are allowed to vote on GoldMint platform 
proportionate to the number of tokens they own. This means that 
MNT holders can participate in the right to vote on changes to the 

platform. 

4.2.1. REWARD DISTRIBUTION 
IN ACCORDANCE TO THE MNT AMOUNTS 

Whenever any GOLD transaction is conducted, the following occurs: 

● 75% of the subsequent commission in GOLD is received by the MNT 
holders to confirm the transaction. 

● The remaining 25% of that GOLD commission is spent on GoldMint 
maintenance needs while the remainder is distributed to some or 

more of the following charities (subject to change): 

!19



4.2.2. ICO  

At ICO launch the MNTP price will be $7 which can change during the 
crowdsale due to the changes in the exchange rate:  

● ICO investors are given MNTP (MNT pre-launch) tokens that can be 
converted to MNT after GoldMint has mined enough GOLD to 

independently support its platform. 

● MNTP tokens will be moved to GoldMint’s blockchain and converted 
into MNT in a 1:1 proportion. 

● ICO cap will be set in fiat 15 days before ICO. 
● minimum cap for ICO is $150 000. If less than that is raised, the 

investors recieve their funds back. 

MNTP tokens are released when tokens are distributed around one month 
after ICO starts. 

MNTP Issue Size 10,000,000 MNTP tokens    

150,000 MNTP tokens will be transferred  
to the investor’s wallet following issuance.

Token Option Pool Size 20% of the mined MNTP tokens (i.e., 
2,000,000 MNTP tokens) will become the 
«Token Option Pool» of the company.

Token Option Pool 
Issuance

These MNTP option pool tokens will be 
issued periodically every three (3) months 
following the ICO.

5. GOLDMINT ARCHITECTURE 
GoldMint uses a private blockchain, called the Graphene platform. 

5.1. CUSTODY BOT STORAGE UNIT 

5.1.1. GENERAL INFORMATION 

Custody Bot is programmed for temporary holding, inspection, long-term 

storing and conveying of physical gold. It is also programmed to inspect 
and store gold jewelry, coins or gold. 

Custody Bot carries out this function on all gold given them by small banks, 
non-credit financial institutions, and private individuals (among other 

Rules No more than 100,000 MNTP option pool 
tokens are issued per round. The amount  
of MNTP option pool tokens issued will  
be calculated by the following formula: 
 
If LEP < CEP:  

(1 – LEP / CEP) x Token Option Pool size 

where: 

LEP = The price of the token during the 
latest issuance 

CEP = Current MNTP price on the 
cryptocurrency exchanges. (This is 
calculated by checking the volume of MNTP 
trading during the last two weeks on the 
three largest exchanges and computing its 
median price) 

Token Option Pool size = The number  
of tokens left in the «Token Option Pool» 

If LEP >= CEP: Issuance does not occur. 

MNTP tokens the team gets are not sold but 
are meant for verifying transactions in GOLD.

The architecture: 

Safe Cabinets simulate coffee vending 
machines. Their dimensions are 1.5 meters high, 

0.65 meters deep and 0.8 meters wide. On the 
front is the output tray that looks like the tray for 

CDs in the CD-ROM. Tray size is 15x20 cm. Next to 
it is a small touch screen and a numeric keypad, 

like an ATM. 

Custody Bot contains: 

● Gold retrieving mechanism. 
● Gold checking mechanism — a spectrometer and scales. 
● Individual deposit boxes — no more than 40. 
● Linux operating computer. 

The front door looks like a safe’s door. 

The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain. 

5.1.2. WORKFLOW 

5.1.3. HOW CUSTODY BOT WORKS 

1. User presses the Open button. The tray slides out. The user places a 
product in it, which gets loaded into the box. 

2. The product put into the Custody Bot machine enters the spectral 
analysis block. A manipulator forces the product onto scales where it 

is weighed  twice, once in air then in liquid.  
3. Once inspection is complete, the manipulator returns the product to 

one of the compartments inside the Custody Bot. 

!23



4. The spectral data and weighting data are fed into a computer 

installed inside the box.This measurement data is encoded on the 
blockchain, made public to anyone who wants to see the information.

5. To retrieve your product: GoldMint gives you the code of your 

deposit box. Enter this address on the front panel. The manipulator 
takes out the product and places it on the tray, ready for you to take. 

5.1.4. GOLD INSPECTION  

Gold inspection includes: 

● Visual identification of the product by an operator – coin, ingot, 
jewelry, raw gold or gold granules 

● Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within 
the box  

● Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing  

Custody Bot uses the technologies of spectral analysis and hydrostatic 
weighing to inspect the value of the gold. In the absence of a single 

standard, a specialist also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody 
Bot conducts spectral analysis. 

The process of spectral analysis: 

Custody Bot uses fluorescence spectroscopy, a type of electromagnetic 
spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. This technique 

involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the 
electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light. 

An analyzer crystal disperses radiation onto the gold via a detector. A 
computer-controlled precision goniometer moves the analyzer crystal and 

detector and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary 
radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison 

with known standard samples. 

The process of hydrostatic weighing: 

Hydrostatic weighing determines the density of the gold and is done by 
weighting the item first in air then liquid and calculating the combined 

private density (ρ2). Estimation of density is made by contrasting the 
density of gold to densities of other metals. 
 
The first weighing states the item’s weight (m1) and the second one 

determines its volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2. 

The density of the valuable examined is determined as following: ρ1=m1/V 
Then it’s compared with the density of other metals.

5.1.5. Costs 

5.2. GOLDMINT BILLING SYSTEM  

GoldMint billing involves the following: 

● The company accepts credit card and bank payments for GOLD 
conversion, for fiat, as well as for buyback of GOLD. 

● The company uses KYC to validate trade. All bank charges will be 
paid for by customers with no extra charge. 

● GoldMint may allow payment via PayPal and AliPay in the future. 

5.3. GOLDMINT: APPLICATION

6. LEGAL ASPECTS 

GoldMint PTE LTD is registered in Singapore. It owns accounts in Singapore 
and in the European Union (E.U.). 

The company fully complies with all legal and regulatory laws of the 
operating countries. 

First stage: GOLD is fixed to the current price of gold set on the London 

Bullion Market Association (LBMA). Full details of this transaction are 
downloaded to the blockchain. One GOLD is defined as a unit of digital 

goods, which the company contracts to buy back from the user at a 
predetermined price. 

Later stages: Applicants go through GoldMint’s KYC procedure for selling 

and buying GOLD. GoldMint invests its proceeds of sales from GOLD on 
stocking its gold reserves for commissions (as well as for fulfilling its 

fundamental purposes). These commissions are different from the 
commissions made on GOLD transactions and are charged to a different 

account. 

Other details include the following: 

● MNTP (MNT pre-launch) tokens are static, meaning that their 
ownership does not give you passive income. 

● Citizens of U.S.A. and Singapore are not allowed to sell MNTP 
tokens. 

● If necessary, GoldMint will reimburse any U.S.A. and Singapore 
citizen who bought MNTP tokens with fiat. 

● GoldMint may entertain the possibility of registering  its project in 
the SEC would their project enter the American market. 

● GoldMint is advised on all legal issues by its legal consultant, 
Deloitte CIS. Topics include the following: 

Assessment of Regulatory Implications, where Deloitte CIS checks to see 

whether the project should be regulated by the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore. 
 
If the project requires government regulation, Deloitte CIS advises on

obligatory regulations and legal requirements that may include needed 

registration or license types based on the targeted market and projected 
activities. 
 
Deloitte CIS keeps GoldMint informed on predicted government regulations 

that may effect its organization. 

GoldMint may check with the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) whether they consider 

MNTP and MNT securities.

Advantages of using GoldMint rather than Ethereum are as follows: 

● Safer — GoldMint’s blockchain uses its own coins rather than Turing-
complete smart contracts. 

● Fungible — GoldMint uses Point-of-Stake (PoS), and since it relegates 
its platform to GOLD transactions alone (rather than to additional 
ICOs) processes your transactions faster. 

● Cheaper — There is no charge for ether commissions. 

The Graphene blockchain supports PoS. 
  

Graphene also allows you to use other platforms that include: 
  

●  Openledger — exchange 
●  Rudex — exchange 
●  Satoshi.fund — fund 
●  Hubdsp — DSP platform 
●  Peerplays — betting platform 
●  Steemit / Golos.io — news platform 

Qualities of the GoldMint private blockchain: 
Transparent 

● Anyone can be a miner. You just need to download a program from 
the GoldMint repository, launch it on your device, fine-tune it and 

start mining. 
Consensus algorithm 

● We use PoS as our primary mining system. 
Miner rotation 

● The amount of stakes depends on the amount of MNT a miner 
holds. So, if a miner owns 50% MNT, he will be chosen to process 

every second block. 
Miner rewards 

● A miner receives a GOLD commission from each processed block. 
No tokens are emitted once the block is processed. 

Different incentives 

● Since different blocks contain varying amounts of transactions, their 
total reward can vary from block to block. On the whole, however, 

the miner’s reward correlates to his, or her, amount of MNT tokens. 

● The amount of MNT is never more than 10,000,000. 
● GoldMint’s mobile and personal wallets and apps for ETH and GOLD 

can be found on www.GoldMint.io

10. GLOSSARY 

10.1. IPFS 

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol designed to create a 

permanent and decentralized method of storing and sharing files. It is a 
content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol. Nodes 

in the IPFS network form a distributed file system. IPFS is an open 
source project developed in 2014 by Protocol Labs with help from the open 

source community. It was designed by Juan Benet. 

10.2. CALL OPTION 

Call option (call) is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy an asset 

in the future at a certain date at a specified price. 
The contract is entered into by the buyer of the option (the option holder) 
and the seller of the option. There is an important difference between the 

buyer and the seller. The buyer of the call option is not obliged to buy the 
asset. But the call option seller is obliged to sell the asset if the buyer 

requests it. 
The buyer pays the seller the price of the option (the option premium) at 

closing. This is a fee for the right to buy an asset in the future. 
The transaction is called “the exercise of the option”. 

Exercise price (strike price) is the amount that the buyer paid for the option 
to purchase the asset. 

10.3. KYC 

Know your customer (KYC) is the process of a business identifying and 
verifying the identity of its clients.
