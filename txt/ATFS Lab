Welcome to ATFS Project 
 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, 34% higher than today. Nearly all 

of this population increase is to occur in developing countries. Urbanization continues as well at an 

accelerated pace and about 70% of the world’s population will be concentrated in urban 

environments, compared to the 49% today. Plus, income levels will be many multiples than now. In 

order to feed this larger, more urbanized and richer population, food production–net of food used 

for biofuels–must increase by a whopping 70%. 

 

So, how do we support the green 

corps we eat, and meet the increased 

protein needs of the planet’s growing 

population? It’s no secret that the 

developed world is obsessed with 

protein, with the average person in the 

U.S. consuming double the 

recommended daily amount (103 

grams per day), of which two-thirds 

comes from animal sources. The 

challenge intensifies with the rise of 

animal protein consumption in 

developing countries like China and 

India due to their rising incomes and 

improved quality of life. 

 

Another issue that goes hand in hand with population explosion is the aging population. According 

to “World Population Prospects”, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or over is 

projected to grow by 56%, from 901 million to 1.4 billion, between 2015 and 2030. By 2050, this 

group is to reach nearly 2.1 billion, more than double its number from 2015. East Asian nations like 

China and Japan is projected to suffer from a sharp decrease of population fit for agricultural 

activities due to its rapid increase of elderly population (+65 years of age). Therefore, the aging 

population undoubtedly will lead to significant reduction of agricultural productivity in the world.

This is the future of the world we live in today. We must get together at the forefront of agricultural 

revolution to solve imminent problems of food supply chain, food security, supply of meat and 

agricultural productivity. 

 

Our team proposes an integrated approach with three organically linked missions as a solution: 

 

 Mission 1 - Smart Farm 2.0  

 Mission 2 - Disruptive Decentralized Platform 

 Mission 3 - Plant-Based Meat

II. WHAT IS ATFS PROJECT? 

 
ATFS Project is the world’s first decentralized AgriTech & Food Science crowdfunding project built 

on Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts. 

 

We are bringing Industrial Revolution 4.0 to the crypto world with ATFS Token. The issuance of 

ATFS Token finances the establishment of Smart Farm 2.0, development of Disruptive 

Decentralized Platform, and production of Plant-Based Meat. The project is an all-around solution 

to the world’s growing food crisis by providing relevant technological advances in agriculture, new 

revenue base and supply systems, and a socially-acceptable alternative to meat consumption. 

 

ATFS Project and its team members vow to enhance people’s quality of life all around the world by 

revolutionizing the current food system. Therefore, it is necessary and critical to secure funding 

during our crowdfunding period. By participating, you are joining a group of like-minded pioneers 

who knows of the benefits that the next agricultural revolution will generate. The profits from all 

stages of the ATFS Project will be shared based on ATFS Token’s smart contracts. 

 

We are fully confident that the ATFS Project is a win-win model for both agriculture industry and 

the crypotoworld.

1. CORE FEATURES 
 
 ATFS Business Model Architecture 

 

 Launching the Largest Smart Farm 2.0 Project in Asia 

Smart Farm 2.0 is an intelligent farm powered by deep learning by combining information, 

communication, technology (ICT), IoT, Big Data, and more within the agriculture industry. It 

automatically and tactically controls proper temperature, humidity, sunlight, carbon dioxide, water 

and so on of a crop cultivation facility by utilizing IoT technology, sensors and analytic software 

with networked environment. In other words, Smart Farm 2.0 enables proactive prediction, real-

time response and situation-specific simulation 24/7/365. 

 

Following the plant breeding and genetics revolution in the agricultural industry, Smart Farm 2.0 

leads the “Third Green Revolution” in agriculture by providing optimal growth environment and 

directing its controls based on relevant big data analysis. It creates high added value by improving 

productivity, efficiency, and quality throughout the entire production life-cycle, distribution and 

consumption process of an agricultural product. 

 



 

Under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(“Exchange Act”), ATFS Tokens have 

not been and will not be registered and shall not be sold in the United States or for the benefit of US persons, unless they are registered, or an 

exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. The same applies to Cayman Islands and other restricted countries 

and territories as above. See more details at Terms & Conditions. 

© Copyright 2017 ATFS Lab., Limited. All rights reserved.                             10 / 49 

ATFS Project’s first goal is to build the largest Smart Farms in Asia, where smart farms are still in 

its early entry stage. 

 

 Disruptive Decentralized Platform (DDP) 

The purpose of Disruptive Decentralized Platform is to completely destroy the food distribution 

problems that have been occurring in all stages of current distribution channels, and to recreate the 

distribution structure of new models. It will become the best profit model for both producers 

(farmers) and consumers by drastically eliminating the complicated, high-cost and multi-level 

distribution structure with entry barriers and inefficiency of information by directly connecting the 

two players.  

 

The Disruptive Decentralized Platform is an easy-to-use platform with convenient access running 

on the apps and web anytime, anywhere. The payment gateway of this platform is conducted on 

the blockchain by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all ERC20 based altcoins as well as fiat currencies. We 

know that more commercial platforms will gradually accept cryptocurrencies in the future, just like 

how a couple of pizzas cost 10,000 bitcoins at first.  

 

 Plant-Based Meat (First, Asia Pacific and then the rest of world) 

Plant-Based meat is going to be the future’s top protein alternative and the solution to the world’s 

pending meat shortage issue. AFTS Project aims to first launch types of oriental meats befitting to 

the Asian region and culture, and plans to expand our Plant-Based Meat assortments to the rest of 

the world. 

 

The project’s blueprint for Plant-Based Meat (vegetable protein) utilizes biotechnology and 

synthetic biology combined with agricultural cultivation capability and technology accumulated from 

Smart Farm 2.0 operations. For optimal results, we will establish a specialized and dedicated 

Research & Development Center in collaboration with leading universities and research institutes 

at home and abroad.

2. TECHNOLOGY 
 

 ATFS DDP (Pick&Go) Conceptual System Architecture 

The conceptual system architecture of ATFS Pick & Go (which is called Disruptive Decentralized 

Platform) is composed of three layers: Transaction Layer, Data Layer, Middle Layer. 

 

Transaction Layer describes a set of fundamental rules that govern decentralized transaction on 

Pick&Go between two or more trading related partners. . Each transaction refers to a product 

category sold on the DDP’s marketplace.  

 

Transaction Layer protocol is made of 3 major sub-components 

➢ Smart Contracts 

  Formalizes trading terms 

➢ Payment and Escrow 

  Payment with altcoins, fiat currencies 

  Escrow selection 

➢ Altcoin Converter 

  Exchange between Representative Coins and other altcoins 

 



 

Under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(“Exchange Act”), ATFS Tokens have 

not been and will not be registered and shall not be sold in the United States or for the benefit of US persons, unless they are registered, or an 

exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. The same applies to Cayman Islands and other restricted countries 

and territories as above. See more details at Terms & Conditions. 

© Copyright 2017 ATFS Lab., Limited. All rights reserved.                             12 / 49 

Data Layer consists of ATFS P2P Network and Ethereum blockchain. Peer-to-peer connection will 

be scalable in design, supporting people to find goods that they need and offer to others locally to 

all around the world. The blockchain ensures transparency, data evidence. 

 

Middle layer is responsible for connecting to the web and app’s front-end by executing ATFS 

Trading Protocol with other users on the network. It can also be optimized for ATFS Pick&Go by 

utilizing commercial and/or open source APIs. 

 

And the web/app enables users to fulfill any desired role on the network (merchant, buyer, and 

verifier). The UI/UX flow will vary on the type of trading to be conducted. 

 

So far, this is an overview of Pick&Go’s conceptual architecture. In the future, we may disclose 

more detailed technical plans when necessary. 

 

 Required Technologies for ATFS Project 

 

Required technologies are allocated to four categories depending on project characteristics: 

overall element technology; Smart Farm 2.0 technology; Disruptive Decentralized Platform 

technology; and Plant-Based Meat technology.

III. ICO 

1. ICO STRUCTURE 
 

ATFS Project is crowdfunding to support the establishment of Smart Farm 2.0, Disruptive 

Decentralized Platform, and Plant-Based Meat to tackle the impending food crisis. For this reason, 

ATFS LAB plans to issue “ATFS Token (ATFS)” through the smart contract system operated by 

Ethereum Blockchain. 

  

ATFS Token (ATFS) will be distributed at a rate of 20 per USD 1 to participate during the 

crowdfunding period. ATFS Project aims to crowdfund from USD 2M (Soft Cap) to USD 20M (Hard 

Cap). Participation Period will last for 31 days. If hard-cap is reached, the crowdfunding will close 

automatically. After closing crowdfunding period, unsold tokens will be burned. 

 

ATFS LAB is a public registered legal body with legal responsibilities and is subject to audits when 

necessary. This will be ensured by the transparency of operation of the ATFS project and the 

secure custody of the funds. 

 

Token Name: ATFS Token (ATFS) – ATFS LAB Profit Share Smart Contract 

ATFS Token (ATFS) represents the right to receive a part of distributable profits of ATFS LAB. All 

tokens in aggregate will have the right to receive 20% of such profits. The tokens will be assigned 

pro-rata to the funds provided to the ATFS LAB during Initial Coin Offering. 

 

Payout Structure 

According to the bylaws, ATFS Token participators may receive certain rewards at the discretion of 

ATFS BOD with a limit of 20% of distributable profit of ATFS LAB to the official Ethereum (ETH) 

wallet at the end of each fiscal year. In other words, the token owners will receive the applicable 

profit equal to the holding ratio of ATFS Tokens automatically calculated by smart contract.

V. ATFS PROJECT DETAILED DESCRIPTION 

 

1. SMART FARM 2.0 EMPOWERED BY DEEP LEARNING WITH IoT, Big 
Data 

 

 Overview 

The agricultural sector is going to face enormous challenges in order to feed the 9.7 billion people 

inhabiting the planet by 2050. According to FAO predictions, food production should be increased 

by 70% to sustain the world population in spite of limited availability of arable lands, increasing 

needs for freshwater (agriculture consumes 70% of the world’s freshwater supply), and other less 

predictable factors such as the impact of climate change. 

 

Smart Farm 2.0 represents the application of deep learning with cutting edge Information and 

Communication Technologies (ICT) into agriculture industry, leading to what may be called the 

“Third Green Revolution”, following the plant breeding and genetics revolutions. The application of 

combining precision system equipment, IoT, sensors and actuators, geo-positioning systems, big 

data, unmanned vehicles (UVs, drones), robotics is shaping the future of agriculture.

not been and will not be registered and shall not be sold in the United States or for the benefit of US persons, unless they are registered, or an 

exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. The same applies to Cayman Islands and other restricted countries 

and territories as above. See more details at Terms & Conditions.

 Market Insights 

Agriculture is wrongly perceived and usually categorized as a low-tech sector. However, Smart 

Farms involve technology-driven information analysis of data acquired from the fields, plus the 

application of inputs according to data analysis for optimal crop productivity. Smart Farms help 

improve quality of food and increase farm yields through high technology.  

 

The smart agriculture market is expected to grow from USD 5.18 billion in 2016 to USD 11.23 

billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 13.27% between 2017 and 2022. Major restraining factors against 

the growth of smart agriculture market are high initial investments and lack of technical awareness 

among the growers. 

 

Asia Pacific Region (APAC) is a prospective market for smart agriculture. This region has large 

farmlands and is witnessing a high population growth rate. Its large regional spread comprises of 

China, Japan, India, Australia, and South Korea among others. The smart agriculture market in 

APAC is in an early stage, and expected to grow at a double digit rate between 2017 and 2022. 

Currently, India, Australia, China and Japan hold a major share of the smart agriculture market with 

their high growth rate.

 Smart Farm Technologies 

 

 Cloud IoT 

Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the agriculture 

industry and enabling farmers to contend with the 

enormous challenges they face. Innovative IoT 

applications enable quality improvement, quantity 

increase, sustainability, and cost effectiveness of 

agriculture production.  

Today’s farms–no matter the size–may use IoT to 

remotely monitor sensors. The sensors detect soil 

moisture, crop growth and nutrient state levels as well as 

manage and control connected harvest and irrigation 

equipment. The data from the sensors are analyzed with 

AI-based learning to aid decision making. Third party information such as weather services 

provides deeper insights. 

 

 BigData  

In smart agriculture, big data influence the entire food 

supply chain. Use of big data provides predictive 

insights in farming operations, and effectively drives 

real-time operations. As smart machines and sensors 

crop up on farms, and farm data grow in quantity and 

scope, farming processes will become increasingly 

data-driven and data-enabled.  

 

While precision agriculture just takes in-field variability 

into account, smart farming goes beyond by collecting 

contextual data in real-time events. Real-time assisting 

reconfiguration features are required to carry out agile actions, especially in cases of suddenly 

changed operational conditions or other circumstances (e.g. weather or disease alert). Big data 

also include market data and competitive farm benchmarks. Using all of the data provided and by 

installing smart devices across the farm, the day-to-day operations would become almost 

autonomous. However, humans would still be involved in the implementation and maintenance 

stages of the technology.

 Our Approach for Smart Farm 2.0 

ATFS will adopt Best of Breed approach considering the optimized production method according to 

characteristics of each agricultural product. This approach enables the maximization of land use 

efficiency, the preemptive and immediate responding to market demand, and mass production of 

multiple products. 

 

In addition, our Smart Farm 2.0 has advantages in both the quantitative and qualitative aspects.

 Hot Investment in the Current Times 

 

Nowadays, bold and symbolic large-scale investments are taking place in advanced agriculture like 

smart farms by world-class investment companies. Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, recently 

invested USD $200 million in a vertical farm start-up in the U.S. called, Plenty, through the Vision 

Fund of the Softbank Group. 

 

Reference article on Smart Farm: Bloomberg News update 

 

Son is particularly interested in how this kind of 

company can help nations grow sufficient food 

to support the population.  

 

“We believe Plenty’s team will remake the 

current food system to improve people’s quality 

of life”, said Son in his statement.

2. DISRUPTIVE DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM (DDP) 
 
 Market Insights 

The global food market is expected to grow from $ 4.8 trillion in 2011 to $ 5.3 trillion in 2014, 

growing at an annual average rate of 3.9 percent, to $ 5.6 trillion in 2015 and $ 6.3 trillion in 2018. 

 

The food market in the Asia-Pacific region grew at an average annual rate of 5.9%, and exceeded 

the size and weight of the world’s largest European food market for the first time in 2014. 

Compared to other major industries, the global food industry's market size in 2011 is larger than 

the global automobile market ($1.7 trillion), the global IT market ($2.9 trillion), and the global steel 

market ($1 trillion) by 3.2 times, 1.8 times, and 5.1 times, respectively. 

 

We take advantage of the global food market’s tremendous size and its potential growth by 

creating a Disruptive Decentralized Platform which links to smart agriculture and plant-based meat 

sectors that we have been preparing to create in Asia.  

 

We believe it will be possible to expand the DDP’s operations into all areas of food industry based 

on our experiences in the field, know-how’s, and accumulated data. 

 

A significant portion of the food market traded in the current e-commerce market is expected to be 

traded on our platform gradually due to the various benefits that Disruptive Decentralized Platform 

offer. We do not know the absolute amount at this point of time, but we expect the DDP to occupy 

a key area of the food supply chain, thus contributing to the sales and profitability of ATFS Lab as 

well as to the company’s sustainable growth 

 



 

Under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(“Exchange Act”), ATFS Tokens have

 Our Approach for DDP – Creation of a New and Sustainable Distribution Cycle 

One of ATFS Project’s objectives is to build a virtuous cycle structure for supply chain between the 

agriculture producer and urban consumer. The Disruptive Decentralized Platform is required to 

achieve sustainable transactions as it eliminates intermediate steps between the producers and 

consumers with its O2O feature. It takes a role as sales & logistics for producers, warehouses for 

consumers. It is a win-win model to all parties concerned in efficiency and profitability.  

 

The current agricultural distribution channels consist of more than five steps. However, the 

Disruptive Decentralized Platform links producers and consumers in one step. It eliminates 

unnecessary high-cost problems that occur in the middle steps of distribution, such as collector, 

wholesale, retailer and breaks down barriers and information unfairness of multiple distribution 

channels. Disruptive Decentralized Platform holds the structure of live direct order and delivery 

system.  

 

Upon its launch, Disruptive Decentralized Platform will collect all operational data to create more 

relevant and accurate databases related to agricultural production and consumption. Regular 

analysis of collected data would be able to measure estimated supply and demand for specific 

products or users, and calculate better inventory management. Thus, Disruptive Decentralized 

Platform ensures increasingly efficient and proactive exchanges between producer and consumer 

with less risk for both parties.

 Less Fees, More Profit with ERC 20 tokens & Cryptocurrencies 

Nowadays, most e-commerce platforms allow multiple payment options at check-out. The most 

popular secondary payment option in the U.S. is PayPal. This is great as many people have 

PayPal accounts, and most of them prefer to pay by PayPal rather than entering in credit card 

details on yet another website. On our side of the world, as the cryptoworld grows by issuing more 

altcoins, there will be a need for platforms that take all sorts of altcoins. Therefore, the Disruptive 

Decentralized Platform accepts all altcoins based on ERC20 Tokens with less fees, more easily.  

 

Forget the various fees like monthly fees, fixed fees per transaction, chargebacks, payments from 

international cards, and more that the conventional payment gateways and merchants charge. 

Disruptive Decentralized Platform accepts all ERC20 Tokens for our merchant products with less 

fees than any other e-commerce platforms and existing payment gateways.

3. PLANT-BASED MEAT 
 

 Market Insights  

The global meat substitute market is growing steadily at a CAGR of 6.8%. The market was valued 

at USD 3.75 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach USD 5.89 billion by 2022. Currently, the global 

trend of campaigning ‘go vegetarian’ is the most powerful influencer on the demand for meat 

substitute products. Health benefits of cholesterol-free plant protein, with meat-like texture is the 

main factor promoting the growth of meat substitutes. Soy-based products such as tofu, miso, yaso, 

natto, and seitan are fast becoming popular among consumers. The market is fragmented; the top 

five players occupied 41% of total market share in 2015. Product innovation and artificial meat 

taste are two factors driving market growth. 

 

Plant-Based Meat Market to Reach $5.2 Billion by 2020 

 

 

 Solution 

Innovations in the plant-based protein have the power to transform food as we know it and write 

the story of the future of food. By choosing Plant-Based Meat as a direct source of protein, we 

would use less of our planet’s finite resources, drastically cut down our carbon footprint and give 

thousands of species a fighting chance at survival. Most importantly, we could redirect enough 

grain to feed our entire growing population over the course of the next 30 years and beyond. 

 

If you look closely at our current food system and livestock production, in particular, you will learn 

that producing enough food is not the problem. The fact is that the world currently produces about

non-food uses (including biofuels), were targeted for direct consumption, around 70 percent more 

calories would become available – potentially providing enough calories to meet the basic needs of 

an additional four billion people! 

 

The answer would be to encourage people to cut down on meat consumption and eat more plant-

based Foods, which is undoubtedly the right advice. But what about the billions of people that just 

refuse to cut down or give up on meat because of its cultural significance or because of their love 

for its taste and texture? The answer can be found in the plant kingdom. 

 

 Plant-Based Protein Tech Revolution 

Today’s food scientists aren’t just extracting protein from soy and wheat to produce meaty 

alternatives. They are breaking down the structural components of meat and other animal sources 

of protein, turning to the plant base and using computing capability to find viable replicas or 

combinations that can result in a product that tastes, feels, and even smells like the real thing with 

an identical (or even more enhanced) nutritional profile. 

 

TARGET CONSUMERS are uncompromising meat lovers, not vegetarians or vegans. Consumers 

don’t recognize it if it is raw-meat or Plant-Based Meat. So, advancements in Plant-Based Meat are 

the kind of technological innovations the world desperately needs.

Typical ingredients and purposes of Plant-Based Meat 

 

 

 
LEADING PRACTICES of tech-driven plant-based proteins that are already in grocery stores or 

hitting the market soon include Beyond Meat, which uses technology to transform pea protein into 

beefy meat crumbles, burgers, and chicken strips. Impossible Foods stumbled across the ultimate 

plant-based answer to animal protein in the form of a molecule called heme that gives meat its 

incredible flavor and smell. Although this chemical is exceptionally abundant in meat, heme is 

essential to every branch of life, including plants. Using a heme-containing protein naturally found

in plants, Impossible Foods is making a burger that looks, tastes, and is even so close to the real 

thing that most people would never guess its base is all vegetables. 

 

 ATFS Project’s Unique Research & Development Product 

Aligned with our strategy of launching Plant-Based Meat in the APAC region first, ATFS Project 

aims to R&D a variety of Asian Plant-Based Meat dishes appealing to mass audience. This menu 

will be the representative eastern meat substitutes like the products of Impossible Foods and 

Beyond Meat. 

 

It is very important to keep the flavor, maintain the texture and even sizzling sounds for Asian 

Plant-Based Meat. And this approach for regional basis will be successful. 

 

See below for proposed menu: 

 

Bulgogi Gyudon (Korean & Japanese style cuisine) 

Bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi (fish 

and seaweed stock), soy sauce and sweet rice wine 

 

Dumplings (Eastern Asian cuisine) 

Dumplings consisting of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough. The dough can be based on 

bread, flour, or potatoes, and may be filled with fish, meat, sweets, or vegetables.

 Plant-Based Meat is the Future of Food: 

Bill Gates was an early adopter (and investor in Beyond Meat). He not only wrote about it two 

years ago and pointed out that there’s plenty of protein and necessary amino acids in plants, 

including the world’s four major commodity crops – rice, maize, wheat and soy, but he added, “The 

problem is that instead of feeding these crops to people, we’re feeding most of them to livestock. 

And so we’re caught in an inefficient protein-delivery system. For every 10 kilograms of grain we 

feed cattle, we get 1 kilogram of beef in return. The calorie kick-back is just too low to feed a 

growing world population.” 

 

 

Reference article on plant base protein on Bill Gate’s blog 

“Like most people, I don’t think I can be easily 

fooled. But that’s just what happened when I was 

asked to taste a chicken taco and tell whether the 

meat inside was real or fake. The meat certainly 

had the look and the smell of chicken. I took a bite 

and it had the taste and texture of real chicken, too. 

But I was surprised to learn that there wasn’t an 

ounce of real chicken it. The ‘meat’ was made entirely of plants. And yet, I couldn’t tell the 

difference. What I was experiencing was more than a clever meat substitute. It was a taste of the 

future of food.” 

"The demand for meat is going through the roof, and the world is not going to be able to satisfy that 

using animals - there's just not enough space, not enough water," says Brown, Impossible Foods' 

founder and CEO.

VI. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

 

The plan is to establish ATFS’s signature Smart Farm 2.0 and Plant-Based Meat R&D center as 

soon as possible after ATFS Crowdfunding Project. As with all new businesses, it is not easy to get 

a firm position in the market no matter the level of preparation. 

 

The prospects and financial statements of Smart Farm 2.0 and the Plant-Based Meat R&D center 

in the early stages of the project is difficult to evaluate with accuracy. Therefore, we prepared two 

scenarios that are tightly coupled with financial data forecasting as the foundation, and is up to the 

team to tailor the settings for each scenario for the best. 

 

Each scenario is expected to go through the same 3 steps described below:  

 

1. Business base is built by implementing Smart Farm 2.0, which produces constant and 

homogeneous agriculture products 24/7/365. This generates more profit than other traditional 

agriculture producers due to the Disruptive Decentralized Platform that takes payment in altcoins 

and fiat currencies.  

 

2. Expand product mix, especially dietary functional beverages with microbiome, and supply 

directly to consumers with third party alliances and Disruptive Decentralized Platform. Maximize 

profits by launching AFTS LAB’s brand of salad-based home meal replacement (HMR) & functional 

beverages through direct and affiliate stores as a franchise system.  

 

3. Create a plant-based food revolution system that brings radical change to the food industry 

through Plant-Based Meat R&D center and product factory, which can be directly supplied to 

consumers.

1. OPTIMISTIC FORECASTING 
 

In the perspective of optimistic scenario, it is expected that ATFS Lab supplies the agriculture 

crops of Smart Farm 2.0, Plant-Based Meat and other product mix to over 1,300 franchise stores 

total in domestically and/or more through the Disruptive Decentralized Platform in 3 years.  

 

Here, product mix refers to salad brunch, functionally enhanced vegetables, and dietary foods 

tailored to specific symptoms and diseases, high quality detox drinks, etc.  

 

If Plant-Based Meat market grow as well as expected within 5 years, ATFS Lab could offer and 

expand our branded Plant-Based Meat & other product mix outside APAC region.

2. CONSERVATIVE FORECASTING 
 

In the perspective of conservative scenario, the team may take more time to achieve scheduled 

performance, but the end outcome is not much different from the best scenario. However, to 

achieve results with limited funds, ATFS Lab will prioritize in better efficiency, time gap reduction 

and best possible collaboration to maximize the team’s expertise.
