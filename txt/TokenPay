FOREWORD  

In 2010 I was introduced to a group working on a startup called TokenPay. 
Following a presentation by the company, I signed on as an investor. The 
mission was clear. TokenPay wanted to provide a secure and anonymous way 
for a consumer to pay a merchant by credit card. The technology was 
impressive and unique. Transactions occurred directly on the merchant’s 
website through a client-side API. The platform worked, but there was a key 
missing element. That is, the ability to obtain card processing proved to be an 
insurmountable hurdle for the team. Despite an active compliance program 
that included all the usual KYC and AML procedures, no bank would agree to 
process for TokenPay. Ultimately the business failed because of this. But there 
was no shortage of demand with wannabe consumer and merchant clients 
clamoring for an account. The public was clearly beginning to embrace the 
idea of digital cash. It was however too early. 

Fast forward to 2013 and a new emerging payment technology called Bitcoin 
was in the news after spiking in value from virtual pennies to over $1000. 
Despite my suggestion for a potential move to a blockchain payment platform, 
it was simply too late for TokenPay to pivot. The core team had already thrown 
in the towel having been handily defeated by the iron curtain of the banking 
industry. At this point I began to deeply study fintech and this new form of 
money known as cryptocurrencies. I started compulsively writing for various 
financial media such as TheStreet and Seeking Alpha. It was at the latter site 
where I met a fellow writer and former hedge fund analyst named Derek Capo. 
Our relationship blossomed due to a mutual obsession over a Park City 
headphone company called Skullcandy. Eventually we became real life friends 
and business partners. We created a startup of our own called eFin. This is a 
website where ordinary investors could receive hedge fund level research in an 
automated fashion.

Around the same time, I stumbled upon an online stock trading community 
called investFeed. The nascent social media startup happened to be in the 
midst of its seed round. After speaking at length with the operators, I decided 
to make an investment. Outside of the two founders, I remain the largest 
shareholder of this company. During this time, Derek and I managed to build 
an impressive financial research platform. Through this process we met Tony 
Weeresinghe. He is a former executive of the London Stock Exchange and the 
founder of Ustocktrade. Tony was impressed with the type of research that 
eFin was producing and he invited us to present at the MIT Fintech 
Conference early in 2016. While at the conference, eFin launched an official 
partnership with Ustocktrade. The AI driven stock scoring system we 
developed was fully integrated into the Ustocktrade platform. This was great 
and all for us and it sure seemed like eFin was off to the races. However, I 
noticed something very different. The fintech conference was being 
dominated not by stock discussion, but by blockchain.

Early in 2017 after realizing the challenge that investFeed was facing in terms 
of traffic generation, I suggested to the founders that they should immediately 
focus on cryptocurrencies rather than stocks. While there were other investors 
that remained naturally apprehensive of the abrupt change in strategy, 
investFeed embraced the new concept. The blueprint was written and an ICO 
was quickly launched. 

investFeed sold approximately $4 million of an Ethereum based token in a 
matter of weeks. The investFeed platform is now flourishing. Traffic is surging 
and the future looks extremely bright. I could not be happier for the team and 
how my early seed investment has begun to sprout. With a roadmap that 
includes grandiose but realistic plans all the way out till the end of next year, 
I’m excited to see this all play out. The shift to cryptocurrencies was timely and 
no doubt the right move. We have not even seen the tip of the iceberg yet 
when it comes to blockchain technology, particularly when it comes to 
cryptocurrency applications. And I know this, because at the same time Derek 
was working hard on something very special. I had to get in on it. 

After constantly hearing about countless hacks causing chaotic volatility in the 
cryptocurrency markets, Derek came up with a novel idea. He partnered with a 
group of obsessively privacy driven cryptographic coders on a top secret 
project. Over the course of nearly a year of intense programming the 
blockchain team created a new secure coin technology that can only be 
described as Bitcoin on steroids. With encryption and anonymity dominating 
the headlines, this appeared to be a winning concept. But to be a game 
changer, it was clear that what is needed is more than just a coin. Simply put, 
the missing link in all of these crypto platforms is the ability to turn digital 
assets into cold hard cash that can be realistically spent in whatever quantity 
without hassle. Through my international financial contacts I managed to 
locate the ideal bank for sale. We moved quickly to sign the necessary 
paperwork to begin the intense due diligence procedure. Firm plans are in 
place for the buildout of a next generation blockchain banking and payments 
platform driven by an amazing team of top industry professionals and 
advisors. This has been a long road for everybody involved in the TokenPay 
project since inception. However, I finally feel that all the pieces are now firmly 
in place. As Freud so eloquently said, “One day, in retrospect, the years of 
struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.”

INTRODUCTION

Digital currencies are often called cryptocurrencies due to the intricate 
technical details related to cryptography, but it did not start here. When 
looking back at human history, from the cowry shells of the Asian region to the 
first coinage in ancient kingdoms, mankind first saw printed money in 
medieval times. This breakthrough was followed by modern-day electronic 
versions of money. Today, there is an international banking ecosystem, which 
consists of banknotes, credit/debit cards, derivatives, stocks, bonds and much 
more. It was a combination of human ingenuity and societal commitments that 
drove the need to come up with innovative solutions to tackle the most 
intricate concept of human interaction handling the exchange of value. 
Cryptocurrencies represent the next level in the evolution of money. The 
technology behind this new form of money called blockchain. It is entirely 
driven by math and is completely decentralized. Most notably, unlike all 
previous forms of money, cryptocurrencies are not able to be manipulated. It is 
essentially money 2.0.

Blockchain is experiencing a period of exponential growth and adoption, not
unlike the collective transition towards internet use in the 90’s. Established in
2008, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain. In just a matter of 
years, it has become a legitimate and tradable commodity on a global scale. It
has massive liquidity with billions of dollars of Bitcoin traded and used daily.
This exceeds the GDP of many sovereign nations. In fact, the market 
capitalization of Bitcoin now exceeds that of Goldman Sachs. There are 16 
million Bitcoins in circulation among thousands of holders. Bitcoin is only one 
of the more than 850 cryptocurrencies available for people to buy, use and 
trade. These other coins are known as altcoins. Many are based on the Bitcoin 
platform, others on highly liquid Ethereum and Litecoin. The features of the 
coin vary widely from practical to practically useless depending on the 
underlying technology. However, there exists a dramatic misalignment in the 
metamorphic shift to digital currencies.

The major underlying problem is that traditional financial institutions and the
related governing and operating regulations are not well aligned with 
cryptocurrencies. The concept behind public banks was designed and 
conceived hundreds of years ago. This is the early stage of a transition 
towards the decentralization of the financial world. But there is resistance. The 
powerful and entrenched institutions are not keen to transact in 
cryptocurrency. And the influence of powerful special interest groups ensures 
that traditional banks do everything possible to reject this new form of capital. 
However, blockchain technology makes the adoption of cryptocurrencies 
possible. It is mathematically fluid and moves much faster than a central bank, 
a regulatory body or international fiscal treaties. Currently, there exists an 
intermediate “limbo” state whereby many cryptocurrency holders are unable 
to benefit from the corresponding economic value. There must be a solution to 
this critical problem that is affecting an rapidly increasing amount of people.

TokenPay’s platform has been designed to combine the strengths of an 
established banking institution with the flexibility and future-forward potential 
of cryptocurrency. The network enables the exchange of Bitcoin, Ethereum 
and other major cryptocurrencies by bridging the transition gap to fiat. It also
enables unfettered user access to cryptocurrency funds at a merchant point of
sale locations and ATMs worldwide. Users will have the ability to store Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies in a secure and insured wallet similar to what 
customers at a typical bank provide for fiat accounts. As a result, counterparty
risk is naturally minimized with a licensed and bonded bank. The TPAY token
sale funds are intended to be used to complete a banking acquisition. This
bank will operate in a manner that will cater to and understand the unique
needs of global cryptocurrency holders.

TokenPay is in negotiations to form a new bank charter, acquire a bank or 
partner with a 20 year old bank, in an attractive, privacy-driven jurisdiction. In 
addition to cryptocurrency holder consumer benefits, TokenPay plans to 
introduce a complete suite of merchant services through the robust TokenPay 
banking platform. All billing and fees collected will be denominated in the 
TPAY digital token, which has already been thoroughly tested and developed. 
TPAY is an ultra-privacy coin that is functionally superior to Bitcoin in many 
ways. It contains several unique features such as multi-signatures, ring 
signatures, dual-key stealth addresses, ZK proofs (zero-knowledge), along 
with a fully encrypted and decentralized Tor network integration. TPAY is the 
backbone of TokenPay’s fundamentally core cryptocurrency-friendly banking 
integration.

Multi-Signature Transactions

Standard transactions on the 
TokenPay network could be called 
“single-signature transactions,” 
because transfers require only one 
signature — from the owner of the 
private key associated with the 
TPAY address. However, the 
TokenPay P2P network supports 
much more complicated 
transactions that require the 
signatures of multiple people before 
the funds can be transferred. These 
are often referred to as M-of-N 
transactions. The idea is that TPAY 
coins become “encumbered” by 
providing addresses of multiple 
parties, thus requiring the 
cooperation of those parties.

Ring Signatures

In cryptography, a ring signature is a 
type of digital signature that can be 
performed by any member of a 
group of users that each have keys. 
Therefore, a message signed with a 
ring signature is endorsed by 
someone in a particular group of 
people. One of the security 
properties of a ring signature is that 
it should be computationally 
infeasible to determine which of the 
group members' keys were used to 
produce the signature.

Zero-Knowledge Proof

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge 
proof or zero-knowledge protocol is 
a method by which one party (the 
prover) can prove to another party 
(the verifier) that a given statement 
is true, without conveying any 
information apart from the fact that 
the statement is indeed true.

If proving the statement requires 
knowledge of some secret 
information on the part of the prover, 
the definition implies that the verifier 
will not be able to prove the 
statement in turn to anyone else, 
since the verifier does not possess 
the secret information.

Dual-Key Stealth Addresses

These addresses are di�erent from the 
standard addresses commonly used in 
cryptocurrencies and allow for better 
privacy. A dual-key stealth address can 
be shared publicly by the recipient yet 
any transaction made out to this 
address cannot be linked back to it.  
When the stealth address has been 
revealed to the payer(s),  it will enable 
the payee to receive infinite unlinkable 
payments. Meaning that each payment 
to a Stealth address computes a new 
unused normal address on which the 
funds ought to be received, any eaves-
dropper will be unable to link the two 
addresses.

TPAY combines these features available 
to make the user experience a private 
and secure one.

Tor Network Integration

Tor is a distributed overlay network 
designed to anonymize low-latency 
TCP-based applications such as web 
browsing, secure shell, and instant mes-
saging. Clients choose a path through 
the network and build a “circuit'', in 
which each node (or onion router) in 
the path knows its predecessor and 
successor, but no other nodes in the 
circuit. Traffic flowing down the circuit is 
sent in fixed-size "cells," which are 
unwrapped by a symmetric key at each 
node (like the layers of an onion) and 
relayed downstream.

TokenPay SCI or Secure 
Communication Interface

TokenPay has incorporated a peer-to-peer 
encrypted instant messaging system 
using algorithms to maintain private 
conversations when using the TokenPay 
wallets.

All of the messages sent and received are 
encrypted by the proven AES-256-CBC 
algorithm and distributed between nodes 
in such a way as to prevent the recipient's 
messages from being hacked or viewed 
by anyone that it was not intended to, 
even if the hacker can view the entire 
network and/or run nodes of the network.

To reduce significantly the risk and 
inconvenience of sharing passwords, we 
implemented the proven and trusted 
method of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman or 
also known as an ECDH key exchange. 
This level of encryption is at the same 
level as what governments use for top 
secret files.

THE TOKENPAY PROJECT

TokenPay is a blockchain project that incorporates Bitcoin cryptographic 
technology with advanced security and privacy features. Additionally, 
TokenPay is building out a platform that combines banking and a closed-end 
private exchange. This enables wider adoption of the coin via consumer and 
merchant services. Developing a TokenPay coin and the infrastructure to 
support its everyday seamless use is a crucial step.

Why did TokenPay base its Blockchain off of Bitcoin?

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the whitepaper and source code of the
Bitcoin blockchain. Nakamoto’s goal was to create a digital currency. One 
which was not centralized by a government or a federal reserve. It is open 
source and allows other cryptographers to improve upon the code. As of 2017,
various developers have produced many di�erent cryptocurrencies. All claim 
to have superior technology. However, Bitcoin still dominates the market. 
Nevertheless, the risk of newer blockchains are prone to security and privacy 
risks. This is a risk TokenPay is not willing to assume given the critical nature of 
the application. TokenPay has combined the most secure privacy and security 
features ever released by leveraging its unique blockchain with a combination 
of the core Bitcoin source coupled with legacy proven, secure and 
privacy-focused features.

Two Fundamental Differences between TPAY and Bitcoin 

 

Proof-of-Stake is Superior to the Proof-of-Work Mining System

Proof-of-work or PoW is a capital-intensive process to earn Bitcoin. Any entity 
with the right equipment and knowledge of blockchain can “mine” or earn 
Bitcoins. The process to mine bitcoin consists of acquiring expensive 
computers or “mining equipment” that uses the processing power of graphics 
chips and electricity to solve advanced mathematical puzzles.

When puzzles are solved, the computers confirm transactions that allow it to 
earn Bitcoin as its reward. In 2017, the cost of mining a single Bitcoin reached 
over USD $1000. As fewer Bitcoins are being made available as rewards the 
costs will only escalate as mining competition intensifies.

TokenPay is a Proof-of-Stake 
system, whereas the Bitcoin 
network is powered by ine�cient 
Proof-of-Work mining.

TokenPay incorporates additional 
security and privacy features that are 
not included in the original Bitcoin 
blockchain source code.

Proof-of-Stake or PoS is a newer form of mining that is referred to as forging. 
Coins are earned as a function of and by virtue of being held continuously in a 
digital wallet. PoS is an energy efficient way to earn coins because no 
specialty mining equipment is needed. All that is required is for the user to 
have a desktop, laptop or mobile device. The network of processors creates a 
decentralized mining system. This allows an extension of the blockchain by the 
user that stakes or holds coins in a wallet. In order to earn additional coins, the 
user must simply keep the corresponding wallet open. For instance, if a person 
has a TokenPay wallet running on desktop, the wallet is allocating a 
percentage of the available processing power to enable the decentralized 
network to complete a blockchain. The person is then rewarded in additional 
TPAY coins for allocating processing power to the system.

TokenPay will only have a total of 25 million coins ever produced. This is unlike 
a centralized fiat currency system where money supply can be increased by 
human decision. TokenPay is fostering a strong user driven community by 
allocating 25% of the total coins produced for Proof-of-Stake rewards. The 
TPAY rewards are given at a distribution rate of 5% per year. Rewards are 
pro-rated and distributed on a daily basis. A typical user with 100 TPAY in a 
TokenPay branded wallet will receive 5 coins per year or 0.0137 TPAY per day.

Complete Tor Network Integration for Maximum Security

The TokenPay project features a complete client-side implementation of the 
Tor network. This was implemented in order to provide absolute anonymity 
when conducting secure TPAY network transactions. According to Tor 
community developers "Tor is a distributed overlay network designed to 
anonymize low-latency TCP-based applications such as web browsing, secure 
shell, and instant messaging. Clients choose a path through the network and 
build a circuit, in which each node (a.k.a., onion router) in the path knows its 
predecessor and successor, but no other nodes in the circuit. Tra�c flowing 
down the circuit is sent in fixed-size cells, which are unwrapped by a 
symmetric key at each node (like the layers of an onion) and relayed 
downstream". Essentially, Tor provides transport layer anonymity for TPAY 
transactions.

For instance, take Amy for example. In a typical cryptocurrency transaction 
Amy wants to make a real life product purchase with Bitcoin.  So, Amy would 
have to broadcast her transaction to a few bitcoin supernodes. The Tor 
developers explain:

Clearly knowing the source and destination of 
Internet tra�c allows others to track user 
behavior and interests. Similarly, enterprising 
organizations have been data mining social 
analytics of the bitcoin blockchain since 
inception. Therefore, it should be no surprise 
that most Bitcoin clients provide user options 
like conducting secure transactions via the Tor 
network. Developers of Tor say that “by 
routing tra�c over Tor, no one learns the 
origin IP address of Alice when she performs 
the bitcoin transaction." Some Bitcoin wallets 
support and use Tor, such as Electrum and 
Armory.

ANONYMITY

      Those nodes then propagate the transaction further to the rest of 
the bitcoin network until it becomes recognized. If Alice did not use Tor 
to conduct her transaction, those initial supernodes trivially learn the IP 
address of Alice. Furthermore, since the Bitcoin blockchain is a public 
log of transactions, analysts could match her newest transaction with 
her previous transactions and just follow the money trail. These are 
commonly used techniques borrowed from the Internet surveillance 
realm, known as tra�c analysis. Tra�c analysis can be used to infer 

who is talking to whom over a public network.

Multi-Signature Transactions

A custom built 2-of-3 multi-signature address substantially fuels the robust 
TokenPay Multi-signature Transaction Engine (MTE). This advanced digital 
protocol protects TPAY users. This works because each party must approve 
the transaction before the corresponding data is published on the TPAY 
blockchain.

Unlike a traditional payment service that uses numerous intermediaries, there 
is no centralized handling of user funds with a multi-signature platform. 
Participants generate pairs of private keys and public addresses. While the 
private keys are kept secret, users freely distribute the public addresses.
 

Accordingly, wallets have evolved from simple software programs handling 
only key management. TokenPay wallets are sophisticated applications that 
o�er a variety of features. Significant innovation at both the protocol level and 
amongst wallet providers has led to the emergence of several breakthrough 
technical standards like multi-signature which forms a critical element of the 
TokenPay wallet security ecosystem.
 
Multi-signature, in general, refers to requiring more than one key to authorize a  
transaction. It is used to divide up responsibility for possession of coins. 
Accordingly, standard transactions on the coin network could be called 
“single-signature transactions,” because transfers require only one signature. 
This is provided by the holder of the private key associated with the coin 
address. However, in order to maintain optimal network integrity of the wallet 
and its assets, TokenPay naturally has implemented the most advanced 
security features. Because private keys can be stolen, this would typically 
result in unauthorized access to digital assets. TokenPay’s MTE system will 
prevent this theft from occurring.

This technique of multi-signature transactions adds a significant layer of 
security. Multiple signatures are needed to release funds. This protects all 
parties conducting transactions with TPAY. This can be referred to as an 
M-of-N transactions. The idea is that the TPAY coins become “encumbered” by

providing addresses of multiple parties. The cooperation of all parties is 
required to fully execute the transaction. There can be several types of 
multi-signature applications  but the most common one is called 2-of-3. This is 
typical of a buyer-seller escrow. The escrow agent is not able to 
misappropriate funds or assets because a buyer commits money into a 
transaction with the seller and a third-party arbitrator.

For instance, If a TPAY P2P transaction goes smoothly, then both buyer and 
seller sign the transaction in order forward the money to the seller. If 
something goes wrong however, the parties can sign a transaction to refund 
the buyer. But if the parties cannot agree, an appeal is made to the third-party 
who will arbitrate and provide a second signature to the party that it deems 
deserves it.

To further protect all users, TokenPay has enabled a system where one private 
key is on a user’s computer and  the other can be on mobile for example. 
Accordingly, funds cannot be spent without a signature from both devices. 
Therefore, for an attacker to steal funds, access must be gained to both 
devices. Clearly this is much more di�cult than gaining access to a single 
device. For this reason the TokenPay MTE is considered to be an extremely 
advanced security protocol. But some multi-signature applications and wallets 
that support them are not infallible.

There have been reports of traditional multi-signature wallets being 
compromised in the past. This has happened mainly due to weak underlying 
infrastructure not being properly maintained. This has exposed key security 
flaws. Attackers have been able to obtain access to two of the three keys 
needed for entry and employ social engineering designed to compel the final 
holder to release the key. TokenPay is not subject to these security flaws 
because it has an infallible system which incorporates the most advanced and 
unbreakable hacker-proof countermeasures.

Dual-Key Stealth Addresses

Stealth addressing is when a sender takes a  public address from a recipient 
and transforms it to a one-time address. This is publicly unlinkable to the 
original public address and to any other one-time address. Only the recipient 
can link all of the payments together. Furthermore, only the recipient can 
derive the secret key associated with the one-time address. By using the 
stealth addressing protocol, a recipient can publish one address and receive 
unlimited publicly unlinkable payments. Dual-key stealth addresses add 
another layer of security. The TokenPay platform incorporates dual-key stealth 
addresses. This refers to the pairs of spend/view keys. It allows "decoding" (or 
removing the unlinkability) stealth addresses without simultaneously allowing 
them to be spent. This is the ultimate in settlement security and anonymity 
and it is standard when transacting in TPAY.

Simply put, the TPAY dual-key stealth address can be shared publicly by the 
recipient but any transaction made out to this address can not be linked back 
to it. It is completely anonymous. When the stealth address has been 
ultimately revealed to the payer, it will enable the payee to receive infinite 
unlinkable payments by TPAY. That means that each payment to a stealth 
address computes a new unused normal address on which the funds are to be 
received.

For instance, a potential hacker or eavesdropper will be unable to link the two 
addresses involved in the transactions. In the figure above P = Hs(rA)G + B is 
depicted. In this image. P is the final stealth address (one-time output key, the 
destination where funds will actually be sent), Hs is the hashing algorithm that 
returns a scalar, r is the new random scalar we chose for this transaction, A is 
the receiver’s public view key, G is the standard Ed25519 base point (the 
EdDSA signature scheme), and B is the receiver’s public spend key.

Zero-Knowledge Proof

When a TPAY blockchain transaction is initialized, all parties sign with the 
corresponding private key. This signature acts as the analogous action for a 
particular public address. The transaction becomes fully executed because all 
parties on the blockchain can then verify these signatures using the public 
addresses. There is no need for a TokenPay user to reveal their private key to 
anybody. As a result, TPAY transactions are conducted with complete security, 
anonymity and without any counterparty risk typical of a conventional 
payment platform.
 
In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a 
method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the 
verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information 
apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. A zero-knowledge proof 
is one which demonstrates the truth of a certain statement. That is, without 
revealing any additional information beyond what it’s trying to prove. 
Zero-knowledge proofs in blockchains apply a similar principle: it aims to 
prove the statement “this transfer of assets is valid,” without revealing 
anything.

Proving that one party knows certain information is trivial if the user is allowed 
to reveal that information. It becomes a challenge to prove that one has this 
knowledge without revealing what the secret information is. For the TokenPay 
zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, the protocol requires interactive input 
from the verifier. Accordingly, a challenge occurs whereby the responses from 
the prover are used to convince the verifier if the statement is actually true. 
That is if the prover does indeed have this claimed knowledge. If not, the 
verifier could record the execution of the protocol and repay it to another 
party.
 
If the new party accepted this as proof that the paying party knows the secret 
information, then the new party's acceptance is justified. That is,the re-payer 
does know the secret information. This means that the protocol leaks 
knowledge and is not zero-knowledge, or it is spurious. The result leads to a 
party accepting someone's proof of knowledge which does not possess it.
Some forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge exist, but 
the validity of the proof relies on computational assumptions. This is typically 
the assumptions of an ideal cryptographic hash function, such as what 
TokenPay has integrated in to the TPAY blockchain.

Ring Signatures

Ring signatures enable a TokenPay user to sign a message so that a ring of 
possible signers (of which the user is a member) is identified. This is done 
without revealing exactly which member of that ring generated the signature. 
It is a type of digital signature that can be performed by any member of a 
group of users that each have keys. A message signed with a ring signature is 
endorsed by someone in a group of people. One of the security properties of a 
ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine 
which of the group members' keyswere used to produce the signature. In 
contrast to the common standardgroup signatures, the TPAY ring signatures 
are completely decentralized and do not require any central authority or 
coordination among the various users. Indeed, those who transact in TPAY do 
not even need to beaware of each other. Furthermore, ring signatures grant 
TokenPay platform users granular control over the level of anonymity 
associated with any particular signature.

A main feature of ordinary digital signatures typical of most cryptocurrencies 
is that the signer needs a singlesecret key, but a verifier cannot establish the 
exact identity of the signer. If for example, one  encounters a ring signature 
with the public keys of Alice, Bob, and Carol, the user can only claim that one 
of these individuals was the signer. However it would be impossible to whom 
exactly. However, digital transactions sent to the TokenPay network are 
untraceable by virtue of using the public keys of other members in the ring 
signature.Of course one of which will apply to the transaction. This way it can 
be proven that the creator of the TPAY transaction is eligible to spend the 
amount specified in the transaction.

Furthermore, the identity of the creator will be indistinguishable from the 
users whose public keys were used in the creation of the ring signatures. It 
should be noted that foreign transactions do not restrict people from 
spending their own money. A public key may appear in dozens of other ring 
signatures. But this is only done as a muddling factor even if a person has 
already used the corresponding secret key for signing the transaction. 
Moreover, if two users create ring signatures with the same set of public keys, 
the signatures will be different unless they use the same private key. This 
assures maximum security and anonymity for all TPAY network transactions.

TokenPay SCI or Secure Communication Interface

TokenPay has incorporated a peer-to-peer AES-256 encrypted instant 
messaging system using algorithms to maintain private conversations when 
using the TokenPay wallets. The system works on the desktop wallets and is 
the absolute pinnacle in secure P2P communication.

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange P2P Messaging

All of the messages sent and received are encrypted by the proven 
AES-256-CBC algorithm and distributed between nodes in such a way as to  
prevent the recipient's messages from being hacked or viewed by anyone that  
it was not intended to, even if the hacker can view the entire network and run 
nodes of the network.

To reduce the risk and inconvenience of sharing passwords, TokenPay has 
implemented the proven and trusted method of Elliptic Curve Di�e-Hellman 
or also known as an ECDH key exchange. This level of encryption is  at the 
same level as what a government security agency would use to protect  top 
secret files and documents.

The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm or ECDSA is used to provide 
confidence that the messages being transmitted arrive at the intended 
destination.  Messages are distributed over the existing TokenPay peer-to-peer 
network, and  a copy of each encrypted message is stored on each node for 
48 hours. Following this period, the messages are permanently deleted with 
no chance of  retrieval by any party.

Practical Uses of the Blockchain Technology

TokenPay’s blockchain and integrated technology allow users the ultimate

Zero-Knowledge Transaction

Amy wants to send Bob 100 TPAY coins anonymously without any
potential hacker or onlooker, Jane. Amy first sends an encrypted
message to Bob saying “Bob, I am going to send you 100 TPAY
coins”. Then Amy begins the process of sending TPAY coins to Bob.
With TokenPay’s integration of Zero-Knowledge proof, dual-key
stealth address and ring signatures we are able to make this
transaction as anonymous and secure as possible.

Amy will use the option to send TPAY via the PRIVATE function in 
TokenPay’s desktop wallet to send to Bob’s Dual-Key Stealth 
address. The network will destroy the TPAY  coins and convert it to  
a temporary coin that is still equivalent to the same value as TPAY 
coins. These temporary coins can not be replicated or copied by 
anyone as they are encrypted solely to create TPAY coins to the 
intended recipient.

After this process is initiated the TPAY coins will no longer be TPAY 
but a temporary coin of which will carry no value until it has been 
received or used by the intended recipient. Then, the amount of 100 
TPAY coins gets split up to random amounts that are never the 
same. So, if you send 100 TPAY coins it could be then split up into 5 
transactions or more with each one having different amounts that 
will still add up to the 100 TPAY coins.

proofs are used when sending TPAY coins as each address that the
coin is stent to, represents the coin itself.

TPAY is Bitcoin on Steroids

Transacting in TPAY is infinitely more secure and anonymous than with Bitcoin. 
It is uniquely privacy feature packed with multi and ring signatures, dual-key 
stealth addresses, zero-knowledge proofs, unbreakable Tor network 
integration and its own closed-end secure communication interface. TPAY 
users enjoy full anonymity when exchanging tokens and trading with other 
platform users. For this reason, TPAY has been colloquially referred to as the 
“Bitcoin on Steroids.”

In conclusion, the original TPAY coins that were sent from Alice are 
no longer in her possession. Jane is unable to know how many coins 
were sent to Bob while Bob was able to receive those coins.

THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE OF BLOCKCHAIN  TECHNOLOGY

TokenPay Digital Wallet Users Generate TPAY Coin Rewards

The TokenPay secure SHA-256 encrypted wallets deploy next generation 
technology that is fully integrated with the TPAY proprietary blockchain. TPAY 
is a Proof-of-Stake coin. It distributes rewards to network holders that use the
wallet. The decentralized network expands virally by leveraging the processing
power provided by TPAY holders’ graphics cards. This amplification is powered
by the TokenPay desktop wallet holders.

Bitcoin Network uses Antiquated Proof-of-Work Mining

Antiquated systems, like those employed by Bitcoin itself, use traditional 
network mining called Proof-of-Work. Whereby the rewards are only 
distributed to the first to find a solution for the mathematical problem that 
concerns the subject candidate block. This is a mathematical problem that 
cannot be solved in any way other than through brute force. When a miner 
finally finds the right solution, it is announced to the whole network at the 
same time. Only this miner receives the digital token prize provided by the 
protocol. Accordingly, mining requires a huge number of attempts and is 
wholly inherently ine�cient by design.

Multi-Screen Digital Wallet is Decentralized and Incentivized

TokenPay features a multi-screen densely encrypted wallet that is 
fundamentally driven by the most secure core blockchain technology ever 
introduced. TPAY tokens can be held and transacted within the wallet itself. 
Platform users engage in secure communications by way of the embedded 
live engagement platform. The actual TPAY token is Proof-of-Stake driven. 
This means that TPAY holders earn a prorated daily 5% per year bonus of 
TPAY coins for simply leaving one of the licensed wallets open. The open 
wallet acts as a generator engine by leveraging the immense processing 
power of the graphics card across the network of all TPAY holders. This set of 
actions allows TPAY to expand its decentralized network and it rewards its 
holders in kind for providing valuable processing power.

            Blockchain is Based on Bitcoin

Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin was developed and designed to operate as a 
transaction settlement network. It is, therefore, the logical platform destination 
for payment processing based coins. Bitcoin is also viewed as a haven asset 
similar to gold. Bitcoin is deflationary and scarce. Rival network Ethereum, on 
the other hand, is inflationary and abundant. Its network infrastructure is 
driven almost entirely with the purpose of facilitating the growth of 
decentralized applications (DApps). Its native ETH token was never designed 
to operate as a digital currency, only to be used to fund DApps running on the 
Ethereum protocol. 

TPAY is the only coin to provide the ultimate privacy of confidential ring 
transactions at the protocol level coupled with zero-knowledge proofs, 
stealth addresses, encrypted chat and a full Tor network integration. Other 
coins have combined some of these features, but only TPAY has unified all of 
them in a single unbreakable platform. 

Monero features the most impressive privacy profile absent of TPAY, but it 
lacks Tor network integration and the embedded secure communications 
interface where TPAY users enjoy the real-time encrypted chat. 

It is interesting to note that Bitcoin itself, along with the supposedly secure 
Dash token, have no advanced security features. 

ZCash is widely considered to be a highly secure and anonymous coin, but it 
is linkable and falls short by not having true end to end anonymity.

TOKENPAY TECH SPECIFICATIONS



TOKENPAY SECURE MULTI-SCREEN ENCRYPTED WALLETS

TokenPay’s secure encrypted wallets employ breakthrough Proof-of-Stake 
automation technology that is powered by the fully decentralized TPAY 
blockchain. Desktop wallet users receive rewards for simply leaving the wallet 
open. The processing power of the computer graphics card drives the TPAY 
settlement engine. This is a decentralized network, powered entirely by its 
users.

In order for TokenPay coin holders to take advantage of all of these security 
features they must download our wallet.

TOKENPAY BRANDED PAPER WALLET AND KEY GENERATOR

While the various TPAY digital wallets define the pinnacle of advanced 
security protocol, many still consider the paper wallet’s cold storage system to 
be the most heavily guarded digital token cache. In a literal sense, the 
TokenPay Paper Wallet is a physical document that contains all of the 
necessary data that is required to generate the essential TPAY private key. This 
can be the most secure way of storing TPAY because the wallet is not exposed 
to malware. It can be stored in a private safe.

The private key is generated by the user on the highly secure TokenPay server. 
It is recommended that users disconnect from the internet when in the 
process of generating a private key. This way the paper wallet generator is 
considered to be truly self-contained and the keys are not being transmitted 
online. TokenPay regularly audits and verifies the integrity of the client-side 
private key generator that it o�ers on its website.

41



LICENSED INTERNATIONAL BANK INTEGRATION 

Although the TPAY core is defined by the blockchain, there also exists a 
uniquely critical banking element. TokenPay has plans to form a new bank 
charter, partner or acquire a licensed bank in Vanuatu. One such current 
negotiation is with a bank that has a great reputation and all the necessary 
relationships to make international transfers possible. This bank also has a 
relationship with Mastercard through an a�liate. As TokenPay wants to cater 
to cryptocurrency customers by tailoring the compliance department around 
this theme, this is a crucial first step. 

The creation of a a bank that is fully committed to customers with
cryptocurrencies is utopian. TokenPay intends to o�er traditional banking 
services with regulatory oversight and fiduciary status. AML and KYC 
procedures will apply the same, as with customers with fiat currencies. 
TokenPay plans to operate in the Hong Kong dollar which is pegged to the 
USD. Most desirable is the partnership or acquisition of a bank that has many 
of the existing correspondent banking relationships that are necessary to 
transact in major currencies.

Privacy Focused Jurisdiction

Vanuatu banking is an interesting and innovative option for the first bank that 
caters exclusively to the cryptocurrencies community. This jurisdiction is 
privacy-focused and has no fiscal treaties. Although it has signed agreements 
for the exchange of information with Australia, Denmark, Faroe Islands, 
Finland, France, Granada, Iceland, Ireland, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway, 
San Marino and Sweden. A domestic law operates in Vanuatu for impeding 
money laundering. This establishes cooperation with investigators in certain 
circumstances. However, most importantly, bank secret is guaranteed. Tax 
evasion is not a punishable crime because there are no taxes in Vanuatu.

TokenPay cannot mention the bank by name as there is a non-disclosure 
agreement in place. But the institution has a robust online banking platform 
where customers use a digipass to access accounts. TokenPay plans to further 
integrate the banking platform with a closed-end private exchange for clients. 
The objective is to receive liquidity in the major crypto assets, including TPAY 
which will serve as the backbone of the banking system. There will be an 
online banking platform where customers can switch between currencies with 
one click and pay the market rate. The plan is to integrate with exchanges to 
provide  liquidity through  the respective  APIs in  the beginning  until the 
platform can reach a critical mass where transactions can be cleared in-house. 

Banking clients will have the ability to apply for and be issued debit cards. This 
will likely occur through the pre-existing relationship this bank has with a 
Mastercard a�liate. Rates will be typical banking rates. As TokenPay will be a 
licensed and regulated bank in Vanuatu, it will o�er insured wallets, and at 
some point, the plan is to o�er actual physical storage in private vaults for 
high net worth clients. This is unique in the market and promotes the seamless 
intersection of cryptocurrency with fiat currency.

This is NOT an actual picture of the TokenPay Bank. This is for illustration 
purposes only.

INTERNATIONAL MULTI-CURRENCY CRYPTO DEBIT CARD

The concept behind the fully integrated BlueDiamond debit card is that it will
be easy to load given its direct connection to the TokenPay digital wallets.
Therefore, spending can be done virtually or at any point-of-sale merchant
either online or in person. Additionally, the international debit card allows
instant access to multi-currency funds at network automated teller machines.
Transparent pricing and low fees make the BlueDiamond debit card a very
attractive mechanism for cashing out digital tokens to enable hard asset
purchases.

A user’s digital tokens like TPAY or Bitcoin can be accessed whenever needed 
thanks to the closed-end real-time private exchange that will be part of the 
TokenPay banking platform. Accordingly, there is no need for the user to have 
to convert exact quantities of digital tokens to conduct a fiat transaction.

This will allow TokenPay clients the ability to maintain unfettered access to 
cash at thousands of automated teller machines worldwide and millions of 
physical and online merchants.

It is important to note that the Mastercard logo on the BlueDiamond card 
rendering is the intellectual property of Mastercard International. Furthermore, 
TokenPay does not have any deal currently in place with Mastercard or any 
other credit or debit card provider. The intention is that TokenPay will enter 
into a card services relationship with either Mastercard or Visa. TokenPay 
intends to aggressively pursue opportunities to directly engage in a business 
relationship with a major debit card provider.

44



Global ATM Access--:
With the BlueDiamond card you will be allowed to access ATM’s 
all over the world. TokenPay understand that crypto holders are 
the most well-travelled in the world.

Real-time Conversion:

automatically convert to the currency of the merchant.

Blue Diamond Card Purchase Rewards:

PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES FOR ONLINE MERCHANTS

TokenPay's merchant services division o�ers businesses around the world the
opportunity to transact with TPAY as well as other cryptocurrencies. All of this
is possible with the integration of our planned bank and exchange to provide
liquidity. Businesses will have the flexibility to convert crypto to fiat. Also, fees
for merchants will be as low as 0.25%. Merchants accepting TPAY will save
more than 90% from traditional merchant service options.

Industry Low Transactions:
Merchants today pay up to 5% a sale to receive payments via a 
debit or credit card. TokenPay’s merchant services will allow 
merchants to accept TPAY coins for free for the first 1 year  and 
then an industry low 0.25% per transaction with no monthly fees. 

Daily Cash Settlements:
Cash is king and businesses that sign up with TokenPay will be 
able to receive daily cash settlements.

Customizable Branded Checkout:
TokenPay will make easy and simple to not only integrate your 
existing shipping cart given the API’s or plugins we will have 
available for you to select.

Point to Click Integration:
Once the API has been integrated with your business consumers 
will simply see a checkout button ready to make the transaction as 
seamless as possible.

Advanced Security Protocols:
TokenPay will be using the highest ECC encryption available to 
assure your business that will protect your wallet from hacking.

HIGH DEMAND AND RAPIDLY GROWING MARKET OPPORTUNITY 

Consider the core tenants of the TokenPay proposition. That is, there has been 
a significant growth in the number of unique active users of cryptocurrency 
wallets. It is estimated that currently there are between 2.9 million and 5.8 
million unique users actively using a cryptocurrency wallet. This figure has 
significantly increased since 2013. However, the Cambridge University study 
quotes that the estimation of the total number of active wallets does not 
include users whose exchange accounts serve as their de facto wallet to store 
cryptocurrency, nor users from payment service providers or other platforms 
that enable the storage of cryptocurrency. In other words, the total number of 
active cryptocurrency users is likely considerably higher than the estimate of 
unique active wallet users.

Bitcoin Substantially Dominates the Cryptocurrency Market

TPAY is entirely based on the omnipresent Bitcoin. In a large, global survey by 
the University of Cambridge, all 51 exchanges surveyed listed Bitcoin. The 
second most popular, Ether, is far behind being listed on only 43% of all 
exchanges. As well, Bitcoin is the most widely used payment rail for 
cross-border transactions.

Licensed and Regulated Wallet and Exchange

TokenPay intends to offer private exchange services under the custody of a 
regulated and licensed bank. Each cryptocurrency has a reference 
implementation that includes basic wallet functionality (e.g., Bitcoin Core for 
Bitcoin, Mist browser for Ethereum). However, a multitude of wallet providers 
haves emerged in recent years to facilitate the storage of cryptocurrencies 
and make wallets easier to use. Market data show that most wallets in small 
exchanges are licensed. However, most of the wallets on large exchanged are 
not licensed.

Bitcoin is the most supported crypto currency in wallets, followed by Litecoin, 
Ether and Dogecoin. Wallets continue to support more and more different 
crypto currencies: 31% of wallets that currently only support storing a single 
cryptocurrency indicate that the current roadmap includes offering support 
for more cryptocurrencies. 78% of multi-currency wallets plan to also add 
more cryptocurrencies to current offerings.

TokenPay is Asia-Pacific (APAC) Focused

The APAC region is embracing cryptocurrencies at a rapid pace. Exchanges 
domiciled in this part of the world account for 27% of the market. This is 
second only to European domicile exchanges. The number of APAC based 
exchanges exceeds the North American count by a wide margin.

Market Data Supports Strong APAC Cryptocurrency Trends

Market data also provides reliable insight into the strength of the APAC region 
as the logical choice for the first crypto-friendly bank. If users are segmented 
by type of payment activities, the data indicates that money transfer services 
are most popular in the APAC region. As well, B2B payment platforms are 
mostly used by customers based in APAC and Latin America. Findings also 
suggest that companies engaged in cryptocurrency focused activities 
maintain a more international customer base. For example, the majority of 
general purpose cryptocurrency platform activity is concentrated in APAC. 
That consists of 37% of all user activity. Money transfer services are 
predominantly APAC based, accounting for 82% of all user activity. TokenPay 
is currently engaged with a bank in Vanuatu. This privacy driven country is in 
the center of APAC geographic region.

Exchange Liquidity:
Liquidity is vital to the function of any exchange. In the 
cryptocurrency world it essentially it refers to the degree in which 
various tokens can be bought and sold while maintaining stable 
prices. Especially in the case of large orders, low liquidity will 
result in a highly volatile and undesirable trading experience. 
Higher liquidity drives less volatility and little price fluctuation in 
the market. TokenPay intends to create a highly secure and liquid 
closed-end private exchange for its banking clients. Funds will be 
safeguarded typical of a licensed and regulated banking 
environment. At the same time, the current zero-fee P2P wallet 
based decentralized trading platform will be significantly 
enhanced.

Management, Operations, Compliance, Support
Critical to any banking business is experienced management, 
particularly in the fields of finance and compliance. TokenPay 
intends to onboard various notable banking professionals to fill 
roles ranging from general accounting to risk management. 
Additionally, compliance will be a significant challenge. The major 
problem plaguing ordinary banks of today is the lack of bank 

55



compliance o�cers that understand cryptocurrencies. This lack of 
intuition and understanding is what ultimately drives the banks to 
be hostile towards new asset classes. 

Marketing:
In order to generate bank account signups and the adoption of 
the technology platform, TokenPay will implement a 
comprehensive advertising strategy that will be laser focused on 
targeting international crypto enthusiasts. The objective will be to 
onboard su�cient enough clients in order to provide reasonable 
liquidity to the private exchange. The banking operations must 
reach a critical mass of daily transaction volume in order for the 
fundamental core exchange to be functional on a multi-currency 
and low fee basis. TokenPay believes that the cryptocurrency 
services business has not been substantially penetrated and 
enormous opportunities exist for a new player to capture market 
share at a rapid pace.

Development Team and Technology:
Competition for technology development talent is fierce. 
TokenPay founders have the advantage of a global scale and 
decades of experience and leadership in sourcing the highest 
quality programmers, designers and coders. Funds will be utilized 
in order to immediately put together a top quality team of 
automation engineers that can build out the desired and planned 
features for the TokenPay technology platform. Certain tuck-in 
technology acquisitions will be considered based on a build or 
buy analysis of the situation at hand.  

Acquire Bank:
TokenPay plans to form a new bank charter, acquire or partner 
with a 20 year old private bank located in the privacy focused 
and crypto friendly region of Vanuatu. Proceeds from the token 
sale will be used to fund the pending acquisition. Additionally, 
several banks will be short listed and heavily considered for 
purchase as well to rapidly roll out the platform across the APAC 
region. This includes financial institutions in the rapidly growing 
top tier banking jurisdictions of Hong Kong and Singapore.

1,250 BTC The additional funding will allow TokenPay to acquire or 
strategically partner with a bank in top tier jurisdiction that has 
enhanced relationships with key international corresponding 
banks.

When TokenPay reaches 3,500 BTC or when an additional 2,000 BTC can be 
raised, the company will be able to not only acquire a much larger and 
established bank in a better jurisdiction but can incorporate additional 
financial services integrated into our 1st Milestone technologies.

Merchant services will also be an additional service we will provide businesses 
globally given the completion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 funded.

Acquiring a bigger bank will benefit card holders given the improved control 
over card fees, limits, royalty fees and reach given the bank may have 
branches that would make it accessible to more customers.

Additionally, TokenPay will be using the funds to implement a private

Potential Risks to Business Model

As with any business ventures, there are many liabilities that have been 
identified. A remedial action plan can mitigate the potential consequences:

Liability
category

Description / Scenario

Performance TokenPay is a blockchain project 
that relies on volume of 
transactions and utility among 
consumers and traders to 
flourish. If growth does not meet 
expectations, TokenPay may 
lose customers and this will 
have a negative e�ect on the 
project overall.

Ensure clear and 
transparent deals are in 
place with TokenPay 
merchants and incentivize 
as many as possible to 
onboard the platform.

Capital
Adequacy

TokenPay is a privacy-focused 
cryptocurrency platform. In the 
unlikely event that there is not 
enough capital to run the 
business, the project may 
experience financial di�culty. 
There are some ways that 
TokenPay could reach this point: 
not enough funds raised 
through the token sale or the 
popularity of the BlueDiamond 
debit card reaches such a 
critical mass that the 
“cash-back” TPAY rewards 
cannot be adequately funded.

Ensure a workable, 
dynamically adjusted, 
financial model that makes 
adequate provisions for 
credits over di�erent 
scenarios of users and 
usage patterns of the debit 
card. Adjust fees and/or 
credits accordingly to 
ensure a viable capital 
adequacy strategy.

Technology This is the TokenPay core 
strength, but could also be a 
liability. Tor network nodes 
could be hacked and expose our 
customers IP addresses, hence, 
compromise our technology 
promises for confidentiality and 
privacy. 

Ensure that the technology 
roadmap, vision, and 
capacity remains ahead of 
the curve. Engage with the 
development community 
and always make sure that 
TokenPay has the latest 
patches, and updates. Use 
of the latest techniques to 
ensure confidentiality and 
privacy of customers 
accounts (nodes) are 
preserved within the 
permitted limits of the law.

CONCLUSION 

While the use of cryptocurrency is sharply rising there clearly exists a critical 
problem with mass adoption. It is a victim of its success. While cryptocurrency 
is essentially designed to be the catalyst for democratizing money, the 
production, supply, and use of it is highly fragmented. There is no central 
government or bank control. Therefore, the currency cannot be inflated or 
deflated. Typical fiat money supply can be largely manipulated without any 
consultation. There is a seemingly unlimited proliferation of digital coins. As 
well, relatively lax regulations and the obscure nature of some digital coin 
issuers is driving extreme pricing unpredictability. 

The greed of early-stage investors has also contributed to this volatility. For 
instance, since the inception of cryptocurrency exchanges coin values have 
been erratic. These sudden price spikes and drops can cause havoc on regular 
money services. All of this a�ects the ability of a coin to be properly utilized 
for remittance, currency conversion and at ATMs. When a cryptocurrency 
holder requires fiat to fund meaningful financial activity, they are faced with 
exorbitant fees. Additionally, a hostile bank client onboarding and compliance 
process remains challenging. Despite what the promoters say, there is no 
reliable way to use cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin ATMs can charge up 
to 15% just to convert to fiat currency. This defeats the original purpose of 
cryptocurrencies, which was to o�er a cheaper and more flexible alternative to 
other payment methods. With no advantage over government-printed money, 
why would an ordinary person use it?

Reversing the paradigm, banks must operate in a compliant and consumer 
protective mode that is driven by massive regulatory oversight and fiduciary 
status. A customer is not able to simply show up with a cryptocurrency wallet 
and convert the holdings to a widely usable country issued currency. And the 
idea of conducting a hard asset transaction for instance with cryptocurrency is 
simply not one that any bank in the world is equipped to process. The problem 
is that any size transaction with cryptocurrency is immediately flagged as 
fraudulent. It is nearly impossible to make larger purchases such as a car, 
house or even school tuition. Issuesrelated to AML, KYC and general regulatory 
compliance are only a few to consider when accepting and  accommodating 
such a scenario. There is a systemic and reputation risk that must be 
mitigated. Banks have been known to close the accounts without warning of 
those transacting in cryptocurrencies.

It seems like every time a new token or coin is being issued into the market 
there is this flawed assumption that full convertibility and liquidity is 
guaranteed. This is not only false, but it is completely the opposite of what is 
the case. Today’s crypto system is beginning to replicate the pre-crisis 
financial system. That is, banks being able to receive any amount of o�cial 
liquidity at will. As long as the institution had acceptable assets to pledge at 
the central bank of course. For everything else, such as self-created assets, 
there was the wholesale funding market. Many of these assets were self-valued 
at entirely fantastical rates. When the wholesale market froze up, only the 
central bank had the capacity to support it. But there is no central bank to bail 
out cryptocurrencies. So, consumerism and utility of cryptocurrencies must

68



 live up to the standards of fiat currency. That is, not on be easy to obtain, but 
also to be able to create, store, share, use, trade, exchange, transfer and 
convert seamlessly to fiat. Only then does the cryptocurrency have real-life 
utility driven by the ability to purchase actual things.

The major question remains. Is there a way around this? Can the 
cryptocurrency world meet the fiat world? There are Bitcoin debit cards, like 
Wirex, Xapo, bitwala and more. But this is only half the battle. There still exists 
critical banking obstacles that prevent the exchange of cryptocurrency to fiat. 
So, why not reverse the journey, and have the banking world meet the crypto 
world half way? In a nutshell this is the central premise of TokenPay. The goal 
is to create the world’s first bank that truly understands and embraces 
cryptocurrency activity. This bank will allow customers the ability to convert 
cryptocurrencies to fiat to enable the purchase of hard assets. This is a bank 
that will inevitably cater to the crypto community in a vertically integrated 
fashion; from consumer accounts to merchant processing. It all starts with a 
banking relationship. This is why TokenPay’s first step is to acquire or 
strategically partner with a bank.

Customers can store cryptocurrency in insured wallets – as it will be fully 
backed by a licensed and bonded banking institution. The ability to convert to 
fiat currency in real-time is conducted on the bank's private closed-end 
exchange. Current market data indicates that the majority of transactions are 
national to cryptocurrencies and vice versa. Traditional banking services are on 
top. These include a debit card that is in fiat currency tied to the bank. All of 
these are ways to proliferate use and adoption of the banking services.
Undoubtedly, debit cards are heavily used in the fiat world. A debit card is tied 
to a bank account based on fiat currency. The debit cards issued by the 
cryptocurrency driven bank will be tied to a wallet and a virtual card. The 
private exchange enables seamless and fluid conversions and transactions. The 
merchant services appeal is that businesses can accept cryptocurrencies. The 
objective is the creation of a complete end-to-end solution for decentralized 
payments and banking.

The TPAY digital token is intended to be fully integrated into to the Tor 
encrypted banking platform and be used as a secure and unbreakable form of 
exchange for products and services. Ultimately, the expectation is that 
TokenPay will become the global platform for simplifying and rapidly 
executing cryptocurrency to intrinsic value capital transactions.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  

TokenPay would like to first and foremost thank Satoshi Nakamoto for creating 
Bitcoin. The TPAY digital token is substantially a Tor-based ultra secure version 
of Bitcoin that is based on a proven and reliable infrastructure. Core 
fundamental TPAY code is heavily influenced by the work of privacy coins 
such as ShadowCash, Verge, BlackCoin and Peercoin. Backbone cryptographic 
coding was driven by Verge’s lead developer, Sunerok. Furthermore, the 
project itself was made possible by Huntingdon Investment Corp. A critical 
partner in the TokenPay platform, Huntingdon has been an amazingly 
supportive backer. 

This whitepaper greatly benefited from the dedicated research conducted by 
artificial intelligence expert Dr. Yannis Kalfoglou. His work on the 
conceptualization of the financial automation platform has proved to be 
insurmountable and literally everlasting. Finally, thanks goes out to the Bitcoin 
community for its proactive development and unbridled passion for leading 
the disruption of the existing primitive and fragmented centralized method of 
factitious monetary policy. TokenPay is a proud Lifetime Member of the Bitcoin 
Foundation and optimistic that theTPAY digital token will quickly become a 
integral component of the global banking system.
