“WE NEED THINGS THAT DRAW ON THE REVOLUTION OF BITCOIN, BUT BITCOIN ALONE IS NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH.” - BILL GATES

ILCOIN is a modern alternative to Bitcoin using a SHA-256 encryption. ILCOIN is a cryptocurrency that 
is not dependent on the present banking system and has its own independent value. There are 2.5 billion 
ILCOIN available. Over 80 000 people use ILCOIN; mostly residing in Asia. We are looking to expand 
ILCOIN usage worldwide.

In the near future we will be capable of handling smart contracts, and we will be able to increase our 
maximum block size in order to avoid future problems like hard forking because of SegWit.

ILCOIN is a high-quality cryptocurrency developed by R&G GmbH. It is mined using SHA-256 Proof-of-
Work (POW) technology (identical to that of Bitcoin). The ambition of ILCOIN is to evolve and become 
the foundation of a new, global digital currency-based economic system. Members of this system may 
earn, accumulate, spend and trade ILCoins for the benefi t of themselves and the entire community.

Digital coins were all but non-existent until 2009 when Bitcoin fi rst appeared from seemingly nowhere. 
It was, and still is, the most successful cryptocurrency. It also brought blockchain technology into focus, 
causing a true revolution in the digital world; a game changer.

Cryptocurrencies (and, in a broader sense, blockchains) are digital systems designed to move 
information among members directly, through a completely decentralized network of computers 
(including cell phones). Cryptocurrencies use virtually impenetrable “puzzles” to ensure information 
remains concealed or locked into a block.

Verifying the cryptographic information is called mining, and miners usually receive a unit of the given 
cryptocurrency (or a portion of it) for their work. Verifying information contained in a block and adding 
such blocks to a chain of blocks (the blockchain) are the main elements of how the system works. It is 
the key to ensuring information is distributed in a decentralized way, without having to originate from, or 
pass through a central data repository or distribution centre.

This also means that cryptocurrency transfers take place instantly on a peer-to-peer basis - directly from 
one user to another - without control banks, central banks, card companies, payment processors, etc.

ILCOIN is being developed into a globally recognised cryptocurrency which is accepted by tens 
of thousands of merchants - product and service providers - in di� erent regions and countries 
as well as at an international level. As ILCOIN is supported by a fast-growing number of 
customers, merchants and investors, its price on open exchanges is set to grow signifi cantly.

Thanks to the centralized nature of ILCOIN mining, developmental work on the blockchain, the 
wallet and the explorer is a continuous e� ort kept under tight control. ILCOIN can be safely 
stored in wallets built for the cloud, Android, OSX and PC and it can be transferred directly to 
anyone instantly at virtually no cost - without banks, without chargebacks. 

ILCOIN users can monitor their transactions through our own block explorer. The system 
is already capable of handling up to 5,900 transactions per second, and it is compatible 
with today’s crypto platforms. ILCOIN is listed and freely traded on several cryptocurrency 
exchanges and it is accepted online by merchants in an ever-increasing number of countries.

The ILCOIN development team has successfully increased the block size to 200 MB making it 
possible to execute an almost infi nite number of transactions in seconds with virtually no costs 
or fees. We are one step away from being able to create “smart contracts”, the fi rst blockchain 
to accomplish this using SHA-256 technology.

The vision is to make ILCOIN available to everyone in the world so that they can enjoy privacy 
and profi t from economic opportunities. The foundations of this new economic community 
have been laid.

“IN THE NEXT 30 YEARS, 90% OF ALL COMPANIES WILL DO THEIR BUSINESS ONLINE” 
- JACK MA, FOUNDER OF ALIBABA.COM

In our lifetime, most things have gone or are going digital. Televisions, telephones, typewriters 
and even information have all gone digital. Clearly, traditional data exchange and payment 
systems cannot keep up with this fundamental shift in technology. The Internet needs a new 
form of money, and in order to move fast and virtually at no cost, money needs the Internet.

The crypto movement, although still in its infancy, has demonstrated the superiority of 
decentralized communication and the voluntary respect of contracts between parties. In other 
words, information shared and stored is based on a consensus among all parties. The fact 
that everyone can fi nd and see any type of information publicly - if they know where to look - 
ensures that information remains untampered and readily available.

While there is, of course, a high degree of uncertainty regarding cryptocurrencies and 
blockchain technology, everybody agrees that it is here to stay. The potential in this ground-
breaking technology, together with the acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrencies - even 
by a growing number of banks and governments - makes new projects extremely appealing for 
start-ups and investors alike.

T H E  C O M PA N Y

ILCOIN has been launched and is mined by R&G GmbH, a young and dynamic online 
marketing start-up company, committed to build and develop a global digital currency-based 
economic system and community. With long-time programming knowledge for each of our 
representatives, we are intended to achieve improvements in this cutting-edge technology 
which is the cryptocurrency world.

Every day we make e� ort to bring more numerous and improved assets for our users. We are 
always looking for ways to update with better security and connectivity to our wallets so that 
we can keep current with the latest technology; providing a better experience for our users. Our 
support centre is always available to assist you with any issue that might arise during the use 
of our products. We also have tutorials to help you feel more comfortable and confi dent when 
interacting with our products.

Although it can be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a 
separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, 
transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input 
from a larger previous transaction, or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most 
two outputs: one for the payment, and one for returning the change, if any, back to the sender.

It should be noted that fan-out (where a transaction depends on several transactions and 
those transactions depend on many more) is not a problem here. There is no need to extract a 
complete stand-alone copy of a transaction’s history.

N E T W O R K

The steps to run the network are as follows:
 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
 2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
 3) Each node works on fi nding a di�  cult Proof-of-Work for its block.
 4) When a node fi nds a Proof-of-Work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
 5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not spent already.
 6)  Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in 

the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on 
extending it. If two nodes broadcast di� erent versions of the next block simultaneously, some 
nodes may receive one or the other fi rst. In that case, they work on the fi rst one they received, 
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next 
Proof-of-Work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the 
other branch will then switch to the longer one. 

New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they 
reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of 
dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next 
block and realizes it missed one.

To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a 
Proof-of-Work system similar to Adam Back’s Hashcash rather than newspaper or Usenet 
posts. The Proof-of-Work involves scanning for a value that, when hashed, such as with SHA-
256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in 
the number of zero bits required and can be verifi ed by executing a single hash.

For our timestamp network, we implement the Proof-of-Work by incrementing a nonce in the 
block until a value is found that gives the block’s hash; the required zero bits. Once the CPU 
e� ort has been expended to make it satisfy the Proof-of-Work, the block cannot be changed 
without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block 
would include redoing all the blocks after it. 

The Proof-of-Work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision 
making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by 
anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-Work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority 
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest Proof-of-Work e� ort 
invested in it. 

If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest 
and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the 
Proof-of-Work of the block and all blocks after it,  then catch up with and surpass the work of 
the honest nodes. 

The probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks 
are added. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes 
over time, the Proof-of-Work di�  culty is determined by a moving average targeting an average 
number of blocks per hour. If they’re generated too fast, the di�  culty increases.

would include redoing all the blocks after it.

The original SegWit problem took place in the Bitcoin network and in all subsequent coins that 
used the Bitcoin technology.  Due to this, a 2MB limit existed, which caused delay in the system 
if many transactions were made within a short amount of time.

The Bitcoin system was not very fl exible to cope with this issue and thus it became a problem. 
ILCOIN instead increased the block size to 100MB+ meaning that we have greatly increased 
the capacity and electronic limits of the amount of transactions our miners are able to close.

SegWit or BIP148 will be available for Bitcoin if at least 95% of the miners accept the new 
source. However, until then Bitcoin cannot do this because the miners have to accept the bigger 
block size and be setup for them. Since we control the network of ILCOIN, we simply adjust it 
to our needs. From 8402 transactions per block, we can handle 1 billion transactions per day 
or more depending on the blocks we mine. At the moment, Bitcoin can handle 375 thousand 
(data is from https://www.coindesk.com/).

•  Blockchains can run code. While the fi rst blockchains were designed to perform a small set 
of simple operations - mainly transactions of a currency-like token - techniques have been 
developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations defi ned in full-fl edged 
programming languages.

•  First, the program itself is recorded on the blockchain which allows it a blockchain’s 
characteristic permanence and censorship resistance.

•  Second, the program itself can control blockchain assets - i.e., it can store and transfer 
amounts of cryptocurrency.

•  Third, the program is executed by the blockchain, meaning it will always execute as written 
and no one can interfere with its operation.

• ILCOIN Blockchain is capable of making smart contracts
• Contracts between parties.
• Defi ne rules and penalties for each type of contract.
• Up to 5 types of contracts to defi ne, each with its own rules and penalties.
• Example type of contract exchange properties.
• Example type of contract exchange shares.

C O N C L U S I O N
We believe that ILCOIN is a high-quality cryptocurrency which will be available to everyone 
who would like to enjoy privacy and profi t from economic opportunities.
