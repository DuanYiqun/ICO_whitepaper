Blockchain-based secondary t icketing marketplace



2

Eticket4 is an international secondary ticketing platform developed by Israeli 
entrepreneurs in 2015. Being an intermediary between various entities involved in the 
ticket re-selling process, the platform serves as a guarantor of transaction security, 
tickets’ validity, timely payment and delivery.

In the fourth quarter of 2018 Eticket4 plans to introduce the blockchain-based 
functionality and new loyalty reward system based on ET4 crypto tokens. Blockchain 
significantly contributes to security, transparency, and forecasting capabilities. A neural 
network based on decentralized statistical data facilitates the ability to calculate the 
recommended price level for each vendor. The predicted price is a function of multiple 
influences, namely: the time left until the event, current demand and inventory volumes. 
The would-be attendees get price level hints as well to rely on while making decisions.

As opposed to extortionate ticket pricing outside the venue just before the event, Eticket4 
mechanisms based on blockchain make it possible to obtain tickets at the last minute at 
a reasonable price, in some cases lower than face value.

ET4 token is a utility instrument in the novelty Eticket4 ecosystem. (i) The platform 
rewards customers for every purchase with 20% tokenback in ET4 tokens or 30% 
tokenback when it comes to international major events.  A token holder, be it a loyal 
customer may cover up to 100% of the order total. (ii) Tokens can also be used by ticket 
brokers or event organisers to gain access to advanced analytical tools for better trading. 
(iii) Platform fee is 15 times lower for payments in ET4. Please check the «Economics 
behind ET4 tokens» section for more details.

Eticket4 has an annual turnover of $2 million. During the FIFA Confederations Cup ticket 
selling period Eticket4 successfully entered the CIS countries and Eastern Europe markets 
having sold more than 60,000 tickets for the Cup matches and major performers’ shows.

As of November 2017, more than 3,500 resellers have been registered on the platform 
(about 80% being accredited ticket brokers). Those are going to be the first to contribute 
their efforts to the ET4 Platform development and benefit from the new loyalty program 
and blockchain-based functionality. In the run-up to the FIFA World Cup in 2018, there 
is a plan to open new outlets in the participating countries and make the platform 
multilingual in the pursuit of world wide recognition.

Eticket4 seeks to incentivize the black market re-sellers to operate according to 
international legal standards and eradicate touting. The long-term goal is to become the 
most secure blockchain-based B2B and B2P ticket distribution and exchange platform 
with powerful analytical tools and an automated flexible loyalty program.

INTRODUCTION

The Online Event Ticket Sales industry has grown strongly amid a major shift from 
physical tickets and at-home printing to a fully digitized mobile ticketing experience. The 
secondary ticket market, being a derivative of the aforementioned industry, is undergoing 
the same shift and growing proportionately. According to The “Economist magazine,” 
the volume of the worldwide secondary ticket market is about $8 billion1, of which about 
$5 billion is in the United States. Eticket4 estimates that in the western markets the 
secondary ticket market share is 20-25% of the primary market. With a primary market 
of more than $1 billion In Russia, the launchpad of Eticket4 business, the target market 
is at least $200 million.

Eticket4 launched in September 2016 and spread across the Russian Federation 
via partner courier service. The online platform acts as a binder and the arbitrator in 
transactions verifying the seller, delivering tickets to customers’ doors, and withholding 
the funds received for tickets until customers attend the event.

By November 2017, Eticket4 had been trusted by more than 17,000 customers and 
more than 3,500 sellers. The peak of sales was reached in the period prior to FIFA 
Confederations Cup when accredited ticket brokers were able to distribute their tickets 
among football fans from across Russia and European countries.

World practice

The USA. In December 2016 president Obama  signed the Better Online Ticket Sales 
(BOTS) act, banning the use of software instruments also known as “bots” for bulk 
purchase of tickets. The impact of the initiative on the black market should not be 
overestimated, as bulk purchases can be conducted from outside the US with next 
to no risk. In matters not related to bots’ usage, individual states have independent 
regulations. Over the last decade, there has been a tendency across the states towards 
loosening restrictions when it comes to the resale of tickets (Minnesota, Connecticut). 
Consequently, 38 states consider reselling to be legal except when it occurs in the 
vicinity of the venue2. In the remaining 12 states re-selling is only legal for accredited 
ticket brokers.

Great Britain.  Since April 2017, when the Digital Economy Bill received Royal Assent,  bulk 
ticket purchases have been prohibited across Great Britain3. Since 1991, in England and

Wales, tickets for major football events have not been able to be resold by unauthorized 
brokers4. In cases where fraudulent activity is involved, English criminal law serves as 
the basis for prosecution.

Russian Federation. In Russia, legislative initiatives concerning secondary ticketing 
market are in their infancy. Event organizers have been implementing their own 
measures, introducing a system of dynamic pricing in a manual mode and quotas for 
ticket brokers, which occasionally results in large inventories not being sold.

Eticket4 in the context of the global ticket industry
The legislative initiatives in developed countries are all in all focused on two major points: 
1) considering the bots usage for bulk tickets buying to be an offence; 2) safeguarding 
transaction security and ticket validity. There is a tendency towards the loosening of 
restrictions, as ticket holders unable to attend events must be given an opportunity to 
resell tickets. Eticket4 acts as a platform that regulates interaction between the seller and 
the buyer in accordance with the transaction security standards adopted in the majority 
of countries. With the introduction of blockchain functionality, in addition to advanced 
analytical solutions based on neural networks, the company has developed a unique 
program of customer loyalty rewarding, from which all participants of the platform will 
significantly benefit.

In contrast to large players in the secondary ticket market in Europe and the US, Eticket4 
offers:

       Last minute deals
Instead of buying a ticket outside the doors of the venue at a high price, all customers 
are able to order tickets on the Eticket4 website and get them delivered by courier to the 
venue.

       Sales analytics
All participants of the platform are able to observe the statistics of ticket sales in the 
primary market in order to adjust their strategy.

       Blockchain-based functionality
Blockchain solution does not solely contribute to transparency and security. Blockchain-
based service provides: 1) Transaction fee as little as 2% instead of 30%; 2) Real-time 
price forecasting and prompts for platform participants; 3) Exchange for ticket brokers 
(B2B channel) with functionality for contracts execution; 4) Loyalty and sales promotion 
program based on ET4 tokens.

In contrast to the blockchain projects planned to be launched in the US and UK in 2018 
(as far as we are aware, - Blocktix, Aventus), Eticket4 stands out as a successful business 
backed with real liquidity and with experience of scaling to foreign markets.

ISSUES HANDLED

Lack of trust between participants

Only individuals who have passed the 
identification process can put their 
tickets up for sale on the Eticket4 online 
platform. Depending on the amount 
of tickets offered, Eticket4 managers 
can conduct a telephone or personal 
interview. Every vendor’s transaction 
along with their payment details are 
encrypted and stored in the decentralized 
ledger. Based on collected statistics the 
seller’s integrity rating is calculated. 
In the same way detailed information 
about the purchaser is recorded.  This 
includes the history of their purchases 
and identification data (card number). At 
any stage Eticket4 can obtain a detailed 
analytical summary, identify anomalies 
in transactions and pricing, and take 
measures to restrict illicit activity.

Pricing affairs

With the introduction of blockchain-based 
solutions Eticket4 service gains the 
opportunity to continuously analyze the 
price level in real time. Sellers gain access 
to advanced analytical tools once they 
deposit a minimum amount of tokens 
(see details in «Economics behind token» 
section). Advanced tools, apart from 
standard interactive report, include real-
time price level estimations and forecasts. 
The forecast price is a multifactorial 
function, which give information on the 
time left until the event, the number of 
tickets left, the rate of sales growth, time 
of day, etc. Buyers will be able to see the 
forecasted price level as well. There is 
no way to discover the person to whom 
vendors are selling tickets.

Legal issues

Eticket4 operates on the market not 
only in the framework of Russian 
legislation, but also in accordance with 
the requirements of other countries in 
the field of secondary ticket sales. The 
service does not work with brokers 
obtaining tickets in bulk  through 
malicious software usage. In cases 
of suspicious transactions, Eticket4 is 
ready to publicly investigate the issue 
on the basis of statistics from the 
blockchain and customer feedback. In 
order to protect the rights of consumers, 
money paid for tickets is withheld by the 
system under the terms of the smart 
contract and only transferred to the 
seller once successfully used.

Tickets validity

The identifier of each ticket put up for 
sale on the Eticket4 platform is scanned 
and written to the block. From this 
moment on the encrypted ticket has a 
clear correspondence between the ticket 
ID and the owner’s ID to rule out double-
spending. Each transaction on the way of 
transferring the ticket from one owner to 
another is regulated by a smart contract, 
so that both parties can monitor the 
fulfillment of the transaction conditions 
including receipt of funds to the smart 
contract account, discount accounting, 
fact of attendance, and transfer of funds 
to the seller.

In the long term, Eticket4 aims at combining the primary and secondary ticket market. To 
reach this goal, the company is working on transparent and flexible trading conditions, 
preparing to launch the marketplace for brokers with forward contracts functionality (to 
the extent that would be legally possible as of the date of the launch) and a mobile app.

* The merger of the primary and secondary market is planned in Q1 2019.
** Subject to legal restrictions that may be imposed as of the date of launch

Reduced fees when paying with tokens. When buyers use ET4 tokens to pay for the 
tickets, the Eticket4 platform requires 2% fee instead of up to 30%.

Real-Time Analysis and Forecasting. As a result of continuous blockchain records 
analysing the system will be able to predict the probability of ticket price fluctuations 
and price trends. Real-time analytics will allow the seller to apply the most flexible 
pricing strategy. As the time of the event nears, the equilibrium price drags toward a 
win-win outcome.  Brokers are interested in all inventory being sold out, and buyers get 
the opportunity to redeem tickets shortly before the event at a reasonable price which in 
some cases may drop below their face value. Event organizers and in-event retail outlets 
receive maximum profit and a positive experience.

Bargaining. As an auxiliary tool in the process of dynamic pricing, sellers can enable 
the “Bargaining” checkbox in their dashboard to allow buyers to suggest a lower price 
or to ask for bonuses in ET4 tokens.  The seller can either agree or refuse depending on 
recommended price and the volume of inventory left. 

Sales Contracts Execution. Ticket brokers aiming at B2B market can make use of the 
Eticket4 B2B blockchain exchange for profitable wholesale deals.

Participants’ Rights Protection. The funds paid by the buyer for the ticket are seamlessly 
converted into ET4 tokens and withheld on the smart contract account. If the customer 
does not report any issues concerning ticket validity within 3 days, Eticket4 guarantees 
timely payments to the vendors (carried out on monthly basis on predetermined days). 
In the unlikely scenario of tickets being counterfeited, Eticket4 checks the documents 
from the event venue entrance, and also explores the history and rating of the seller. In 
the event of a negative outcome, the buyer gets a full refund, and the seller is sanctioned 
or expelled from the platform. Every single stage in the process of buying or refunding 
the ticket will be regulated by a smart contract and recorded in the block for monitoring 
and further analysis.

Worldwide Delivery. As soon as the seller announces the readiness to transfer tickets, 
the system automatically books a courier collection. When it comes to “ticket tourism,” 
couriers can deliver tickets to a hotel address and hand them over to a customer 
personally at a suitable time. The delivery is free and lies fully on the responsibility of 
Eticket4.

Open Application Programming Interface. With the help of the open program interface 
Eticket4 can receive the event description and a vacant seat scheme from the partners’ 
websites and landing pages, as well as upload modified seat scheme to third-party 
resources. Ticket brokers benefit from this feature as it will quickly publish event 
descriptions, images and synchronized data.

ET4 TOKEN

The Token

Economics behind ET4 token

The Eticket4 platform seeks to expand functionality, incentivise customers and introduce 
a decentralized approach to ticketing. ET4 tokens will be generated by the smart contract 
during Token Generation Event (TGE). The maximum number of tokens is 30 million.
 
The Token conforms to the widely distributed standard ERC20. The token will be prepared 
in cooperation with Phenom using a smart contract written on Solidity. Smart contract 
will ensure transparency of the entire process of tokens distribution. Every single 
transaction will also be recorded into smart contracts. The source code is published on 
GitHub (link: https://github.com/eticket4ico/crowdsale).

The function of tokens in the ecosystem depends on the role of the token holder. The 
token holder can act as the event organizer, the ticket broker or the ticket buyer. 

 TOKEN HOLDERS

In the Eticket4 ecosystem a token holder can take advantage of all the platform’s 
advanced features. 

Acquisition of tokens. ET4 tokens are 1) purchased at the TGE with bonuses, 2) 
converted from fiat currency on the internal Eticket4 marketplace after the token sale 
or 3) purchased on any of the crypto exchanges in accordance with the applicable laws 
and regulations and at the purchaser’s own risk.

Implementation of tokens. After the TGE the ET4 tokens can be exchanged for tickets 
or utilized in other forms within the Eticket4 platform. In certain cases the Eticket4 
platform may take the tokens back from the token holders upon their request.

https://github.com/eticket4ico/crowdsale


12

 EVENT ORGANIZERS

Event organizers are representatives of the primary ticketing market on the Eticket4 
platform.

Acquisition of tokens. The event organizers can receive payment for tickets in tokens. 
ET4 tokens can be also 1) purchased at the TGE with bonuses, 2) converted from fiat 
currency on the internal Eticket4 marketplace after the token sale, or 3) purchased on 
any of the crypto exchanges in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and 
at the purchaser’s own risk.

Utilization of tokens. There might be different options for the utilization of tokens by the 
event organiser including, inter alia, the following: 

1) Tickets’ market regulation. Event organisers with more than 10,000 ET4 tokens may 
utilize the extended functionality of the Eticket4 platform . By way of example, the event 
organizer can regulate the secondary ticket market through smart contracts, e.g. set 
price and volume limits on the tickets issued via Eticket4 platform, receive fees from 
secondary market transactions.

2) Holding tokens for rewarding. Another mechanism to utilize the ET4 tokens is to 
launch the reward campaign for social media activity, check-ins at the event venue and 
reviews. This should be available for the event organizer provided that it has a reserve of 
tokens in order to guarantee the fulfillment of its obligations.

3) Diversification. Organizers can convert  ET4 tokens into fiat money on crypto 
exchange or on the internal Eticket4 marketplace with 20% fee.

 TICKET BROKERS

Ticket brokers on the Eticket4 platform are participants in the secondary market that 
issue tickets for sale.

Acquisition of tokens. The ticket broker can receive payment for tickets in tokens. ET4 
tokens can be also 1) purchased at the TGE stage with bonuses, 2) converted from fiat 
currency on the internal Eticket4 marketplace after the token sale, or 3) purchased on 
any of the crypto exchanges in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and 
at the purchaser’s own risk.

Utilization of tokens. There might be different options for the utilization of tokens by the 
ticket broker including, inter alia, the following:

1) Use of ET4 platform’s advanced features. Ticket brokers with a balance of more 
than 1,000 tokens utilize the extended functionality of the the Eticket4 platform. By way 
of example, they get access to advanced analytical tools and ticket price forecasting 
features.

2) Diversification. Ticker brokers can convert ET4 tokens into fiat money on crypto 
exchange or on the internal Eticket4 marketplace with 20% fee.

Reduced fees when accepting tokens. When buyers use ET4 tokens to receive  the 
tickets, the Eticket4 platform requires 2% fee instead of 30%. From each transaction 
1% will be charged to pay the services of miners and another 1% will go either to the 
platform development (see Roadmap section) or to finance marketing activities. In the 
event that the buyer chooses fiat money as a method of payment, the ticket broker 
includes a commision fee of 30% in the ticket price in accordance.

 TICKET BUYERS

Buyers on the Eticket4 platform are participants in the secondary and primary market 
who demand tickets.

Acquisition of tokens. Tokens can be received during the TGE, at the internal Eticket4 
marketplace, as tokenback or reward. The ticket buyer may also purchase Tokens at his/
her own risk on the third-party crypto exchanges. 

Rewards in tokens are given for the best result prediction. Each buyer who pays for the 
sports ticket with ET4 tokens may be remunerated for exceptional sport knowledge. 
The tokens distribution among the those buyers will be carried out automatically. For 
example, if tickets were sold for 100,000 tokens for the match, and 10% of visitors 
guessed the results of the match, 1,000 tokens will be distributed among these visitors. 
The received tokens can be used on the platform.

Tokenback. Once tickets are successfully used the buyer receives 10% tokenback in 
tokens. For World Cup tickets the token tokenback volume is 20%.



14

Utilization of ET4 tokens.

The primary use of of ET4 tokens by the token buyers within the ET4 platform is to 
exchange the tokens into tickets. Tickets can be paid for in several ways: for fiat money 
(national currency), for ET4 tokens in full, and for ET4 tokens with an additional payment 
in national currency in case there are not enough tokens on the account.

When buyers use ET4 tokens to pay for the tickets, the Eticket4 platform requires 2% 
fee instead of 30%. In the event that the buyer chooses to pay with fiat money, the ticket 
broker includes a commission of 30% in the ticket price.

The ticket buyer can also sell the tokens on the external exchange in his/her own risk.

 ETICKET4 PLATFORM

ET4 Exchange intervention. To ensure the buyback of ET4 tokens, the Reserve fund of 
tokens and fiat money will be established.

The token reserve will be replenished through buyback from the organizers and ticket 
brokers (as the rate decreases) or through the receipt of payments in tokens (during the 
rate growth period).

The reserved tokens will be sold before major events prior to token rate growth, which 
will increase the reserve in the national currency needed for buyback after the event. The 
reserve in the national currency will be replenished when selling tickets for fiat, which 
means the full fee will be charged (30% instead of 2% when charging in tokens).

Token buyback (for event organizers and ticket brokers). As an additional advantage 
for the event organizers and ticket brokers using the ET4 platform, Eticket4 considers 
guaranteeing of token buyback at a weighted average ET4 token price on the day of 
ticket sale with a 20% fee. Thus, the use of the Eticket4 blockchain platform will remain 
attractive for the event organizers and ticket brokers: they will be able to either sell the 
received tokens at a market price on the third party crypto exchange at their own risk, or 
take advantage of a guaranteed buy-back with a fee of 20%, which is equivalent to the 
average ticket distributors’ fee.

The 20% fee for buyback will stimulate the event organizers and ticket brokers  to sell 
tokens while the rate increases before the event. Also, the fee will restrict users from 
reselling tickets to another account for the purpose of subsequent compensation using 
a buyback mechanism.

The buyback option is only valid for tokens received in exchange for tickets. Tokens 
received  at the TGE or on the third-party crypto exchange will not be accepted for buyback 
by Eticket4 platform. The source of the tokens will be checked by entries in the blockchain.



15

VALUE BEHIND ET4 TOKENS

Utility. Eticket4 ticketing platform exists and its functionality is already available to ticket 
brokers and ticket buyers. With the introduction of the blockchain-based functionality 
all token holders will contribute their efforts to its further development and receive new 
possibilities that would likely extend their knowledge of ticketing market and help them 
to take extra advantage of it. Effectively, the success and further development of the 
ET4  platform to a wide extent depends on the event organisers, ticket brokers and ticket 
buyers and the ways they prefer to use it.

Being just in time. In the next 5 years, the primary and secondary markets are expected 
to merge, so Eticket4 being a user-friendly project seeks to restore the competitive 
environment in the secondary ticket market and make arrangements for equal and 
mutually beneficial coexistence with the primary market. The Eticket4 team has already 
occupied a promising niche in the Russian market (the secondary ticket market in Russia 
is growing at an average annual rate of 19%) and is motivated to enter the Western 
markets using World Cup as a launchpad.

Scaling experience. The Eticket4 project has already gained experience in entering 
international markets and has contributed to the development of “ticket tourism” during 
the Confederation Cup. The next large-scale international project will be the upcoming 
World Cup 2018. In the run-up to the World Cup, Eticket4 together with its partners will 
prepare additional services and offer loyalty discounts up to 30% for tickets.

The growing demand for tokens. The economy of the token is arranged in such a way 
that each participant (event organiser, ticket broker and ticket buyer) has an interest in 
the use of the Eticket4 platform and therefore needs the tokens which are effectively the 
fuel of the ET4 platform.



16

The legal nature of the token

By purchasing the Tokens, the token holder shall receive the access (except for any and 
all intellectual property rights) to utilize the functionality of the E-Ticket 4 Platform to the 
extent and within the limits established in the Terms of Token Use (as amended from 
time to time) that should be made available within six months from the completion of 
the TGE.

The above-mentioned functionality is only available within the Platform and is expected 
to vary notably depending on the status that the token holder would select after the TGE 
(see section ‘Economics behind ET4 token’)

Acquisition of ET4 token does not represent the acquisition of any form of security with 
respect to the ET4 Platform. By purchasing and holding the ET4 tokens, the potential 
purchaser is not entitled and (or) guaranteed any form of dividend or other revenue right 
of similar nature. The potential purchaser will not have any influence on the corporate 
management of E-Ticket 4 and the ET4 Platform.

Anybody who considers participating in the TGE should carefully evaluate all possible 
risks and uncertainties and study the token sale agreement (including respective exhibits) 
that contains important information for the potential token holder), privacy policy and 
other documents that are available on http://et4.io/ as well as legal disclaimer section 
in this document.

General Issues

The potential purchaser by purchasing the ET4 tokens shall receive the Rights to Use 
the Platform with the ET4 token being the electronic confirmation of the Company’s 
corresponding obligation to ensure the possibility for the potential purchaser to use 
those Rights to Use the Platform to the extent and within the limits established in the 
Terms of Token Use (as amended from time to time). 

Acquisition of ET4 token does not represent the acquisition of any form of security with 
respect to the Platform or to E-Ticket 4. By purchasing and holding the ET4 tokens, the 
potential purchaser is not entitled and (or) guaranteed any form of dividend or other 
revenue right of similar nature. The potential purchaser will not have any influence on 
the corporate management of E-Ticket 4 and the Platform. 

The potential purchasers acknowledge and agree that they are not purchasing ET4 
tokens for purposes of investment, speculation, as some type of arbitrage strategy, for 
immediate resale or other financial purposes. 

ET4 tokens do not (and are not intended) to mean any note, stock, treasury stock, security 
future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate 
of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, 
preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, 
voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in 
oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, 
certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or 
based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on 
a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or 
instrument commonly known as a ‘security’, or any certificate of interest or participation 



34

in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to 
subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.

The original text of the Agreement is in English. Albeit the Company may place a 
translation of the Agreement on the Webpage, the English version shall prevail if there 
is any conflict.
