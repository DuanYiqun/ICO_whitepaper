Version 1.0

1. Introduction

Cryptocurrency is changing the world economy. What
was previously impossible in most of the world – transferring
money globally – is now not only possible, but it’s safe, cheap
and easy.

It also acts as a store of value, like gold, but for the digital
age. Asset ownership is stored in a secure, decentralized
database called the blockchain. This decentralization prevents
any one government or company from controlling it. At the
time of this writing, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies
is $718 billion, up from $15 billion a year ago.

The potential of the blockchain is huge and world-
changing but the lack of scalability, lack true decentralization,
and excessive energy use are issues that plague existing
cryptocurrencies.

1.1. Background

1.1.1. Speed and Volume. Public, decentralized cryptocur-
rencies suffer from slow transactions and low transaction
volume. Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second
[1], Ethereum can only process 13 per second [2]. Addition-
ally, the time to verify transactions can range from several
minutes to several hours depending on current volume [4].

In contrast, Visa, Inc. averages 150 million transactions
every day and is capable of handling more than 56,000
transactions per second [3]. Public cryptocurrencies are too
slow for real world processing by 4 orders of magnitude.

1.1.2. Energy Consumption. The process of mining blocks
uses an enormous amount of energy because of a consensus
algorithm called Proof-of-Work (PoW) [12]. PoW requires
non-trivial computational work by mining nodes which, in
turn, makes it cost prohibitive for a bad actor to perform
malicious acts. This computational workload requires energy.

As of today, 3.5 million US households could be powered
with the energy used to run the Bitcoin network, while
Ethereum uses the equivalent power of 1 million households
[10], [11]. This unacceptable and unsustainable.

1.1.3. Decentralization. Decentralization is a central tenant
of cryptocurrencies. It ensures no one company or govern-
ment can control it. However, in practice most mining has
moved to China where electricity is cheapest [26], [27]. 75%
of all blocks are mined by large Chinese mining companies.
This is true of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and top
cryptocurrencies [5]. In the event of company collusion or
government privatization, 51% attacks [6] would be possible.

1.1.4. Rigid Contracts. Ethereum provides a unique feature
called smart contracts. These smart contracts allow users to
write small, unmodifiable programs that ensure all involved
parties are committed to a set of rules with absolute certainty.
This has been so successful that nearly every ICO in the
past year has run on Ethereum’s smart contract system.

These smart contracts, however, are not smart at all.
They are extremely rigid contracts that are unable to adapt to
changes like real world contracts would. Parties involved in a
contract have no ability to upgrade their contract if necessary
to adjust terms or to fix bugs in contract code. Successful
attacks have been mounted against smart contracts [7] and
there are several known attacks [8], [9].

1.2. Previous Work

1.2.1. Proof-of-Work Algorithm. Proof-of-Work (PoW)
[12], [13] is a consensus algorithm that is commonly used in
cryptocurrencies. PoW was originally invented as a means to
combat spam [15]; if you make it computationally expensive
to send email then spamming would be cost prohibitive
while still being almost free for a normal user to send email.
The same concept is used in cryptocurrencies to prevent
malicious actions by making it prohibitively expensive to
modify the blockchain.

In cryptocurrency networks, ”miners” are special nodes
that perform the PoW calculation on a set of transactions
plus the hash of the previous block to generate the next block
in the blockchain. Since the block contains the hash of the
previous block, changing a historical block would require
regenerating all of the subsequent blocks. Regenerating all
the hashes would be computationally intensive and would
require a lot of energy – and energy isn’t free. It would
also be time consuming. The process of proving work and
generating blocks is called ”mining”. Miners are rewarded
for this work with newly minted coins adding to the total
supply.

Although PoW has helped move us towards secure
distributed ledger system, it suffers from poor performance, a
lack of decentralization, and excessive energy consumption.

1.2.2. Proof-of-Stake Algorithm. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [14]
is another consensus algorithm which pseudo-randomly
chooses validators based on their stake in the network. The
idea is that those with the most coins in circulation have the
most to lose so they are positioned to work in the interest
of the network. This approach avoids the cost of computing
hashes, however, it makes assumptions about the interests
of its members being in line with the network.



Validators within the PoS network are anonymous users
who are identified only by their wallet address. This pro-
vides no additional accountability over PoW for bad actors
who can amass significant wealth on the network. Second,
transaction fees will go to those who already have the most
money within the network and large wealth requirements
exclude poorer coinholders from validation. Finally, while
PoS reduces energy consumption its goal is not oriented
towards high performance. Initial targets for Ethereum’s
Casper implementation are only 100 TPS.

1.2.3. Proof-of-Authority Algorithm. Proof-of-Authority
[16] is a new consensus algorithm where a trusted set
individuals provide all transaction processing. This trust
allows transaction processing speed to improve significantly
by skipping the PoW hash computation. A few networks
exist but they currently only focus on private networks or
do not focus on performance as a goal. Many also do not
have compatibility with the Ethereum network.

One public network relies the US state-level Notary
Public system to verify the identity of 12 individuals who will
act as validators on the network [17]. Candidates requesting
validator status submit proof of physical address, bank
account, social network, and mobile phone to verify their
real world identity. While PoA removes the the computa-
tional burden of mining, trusting individuals for transaction
processing breaks down at scale for several reasons.

First, there is a disparity between the net worth of the
network versus the market cap of the network. This is what
the PoS system attempts to solve. Assuming an average net
worth of an individual in the United States is $68,828 [18],
the total net worth of the validators is $825,936:

12 ∗ $68, 828 = $825, 936

Even if the number of validators increased by an order
of magnitude, the total net worth of the validators is a tiny
fraction of the $6.8T in transactions processed by Visa, Inc.
every year [19]. This disparity introduces a strong incentive
for bribery.

Second, validators must post their physical address pub-
licly which opens the potential for intimidation or physical
threats. A terrorist organization or rogue state can mount an
attack on a large scale financial system by controlling half
of these validators.

Finally, most individuals lack the experience and infras-
tructure to run a secure transaction processing system. This
significantly increases the network’s exposure to malicious
hacking.

2. Implementation

2.1. Proof-of-Reputation

GoChain uses a Proof of Reputation (PoR) consensus
model that depends on the reputation of its participants
to keep the network secure. A participant must have a
reputation that is important enough that they would face

dire consequences if they were to cheat the system–in both
financial terms and branding. Most businesses would face
serious consequences if they were caught cheating a financial
network. Larger companies with more to lose will be chosen
over smaller companies with less to lose.

Once a company proves reputation, they may be voted
into the network as an authoritative node and at this point, it
operates just like a Proof of Authority network (PoA). Only
authoritative nodes can sign and validate blocks.

We are building on Ethereum’s network because it is
much more than just a store of value. That is why we
believe it’s the best cryptocurrency and blockchain on the
market today and why we are using it as a starting point. All
Ethereum wallets and development tools will be compatible
with GoChain.

2.2. Why Reputation?

Reputation is critical to a business. A business that acts
in an unethical way suffers on many levels including fines,
loss of revenue, decrease in valuation, branding, and public
relations. Trust is a cornerstone to a successful business and
once a brand loses trust with their customers, it can take
years repair.

The Volkswagen emissions scandal [20] is a perfect
example. They operated alone to deceive the public and
their own customers. Once caught, it was a financial and
public relations disaster which caused a 30% drop in stock
price and a $25 billion fine [21].

GoChain uses this model to allow companies to keep
each other in check and keep the network secure. Imagine if
Volkswagen worked with Ford, Toyota and others to validate
and verify each others’ emissions tests. It is unlikely that
Volkswagen could have gotten away with their fraudulent
emissions tests. If they had attempted it then they would
quickly be voted out of the consortium and lose their rights
to be a part of the network.

PoR is more attractive to the broader business community
than untrusted networks based on PoW or PoS. Risk-adverse
companies will be able to rely on known brands in the same
way they trust companies like Visa, Inc. or JPMorgan Chase
& Co. In PoR, everyone knows exactly who they are trusting
with their data.

2.3. Measuring Reputation

Reputation is impossible to measure precisely but we are
weighing several important metrics in our decision:

1) Market Cap
2) Publicly Traded
3) Brand Significance

Companies with a large market cap have more to lose than
small cap companies. We use this metric when evaluating
companies because the value of the member companies needs
to be in parity with the value of the processing network to
disincentivize cheating.



We next look at whether a company is publicly or
privately held. The effect of reputation affects publicly
traded companies more directly and immediately than private
companies. An unethical decision on the network can impact
a public company’s stock price in minutes.

Finally, we give preference to companies which require
strong public brands for their business. For example, a loss
of reputation for a company like Coca-Cola or Apple will
be more impactful than for a coal mining company.

2.4. Authorized Signers

Authorized signers are trusted nodes that create blocks,
sign them, and distribute them to other nodes. Similar to
miners in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system in that they create
blocks and sign them but without the mining cost.

A list of authorized signers will be maintained on the
blockchain. Only authorized nodes can sign blocks and all
blocks are verified that this is true by checking the signer is
in the authorized list. The signing algorithm is essentially
the same signature algorithm as PoW but with a different
set of headers. PoW-specific headers will be removed and
additional headers added to enable voting.

Given N authorized signers, a signer may only sign a
block every (N/2) + 1. This ensures that someone would
need to control > 50% of signers to perform a malicious
attack [6].

2.4.1. Incentives / Rewards. Authorized signers will be
rewarded GoChain Coins (GOC) per block signed. Initially
this rate will be 5% of the total tokens which is 50,000,000
new tokens in year one. This rate will decrease over time.
The amount per block will depend on the finalized block
times. If block times are 10 seconds for example, then the
node would be rewarded an average of 15.9 tokens per signed
block in the first year.

There will also be small transaction fees that the author-
itative node that signs the block containing the transactions
will keep.

Figure 1. Total GOC (in billions)

The consensus protocol ensures fairness and liveness
by incentivizing the assigned signer of a block to perform
the signing but also allowing other blocks to sign if the
assigned signer is unavailable. The assigned signer for a
block is determined by a round-robin lookup of the authorized
signer list. If the assigned signer doesn’t respond then then
other signers can sign at a lower block difficulty level. See
Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1: Signing Blocks
1 Function Sign(block)
2 if signed in last (n/2) + 1 blocks then
3 return;
4 end
5 if block.number%signern = signerindex then
6 block.difficulty = 2;
7 else
8 block.difficulty = 1;
9 end

10 end

2.5. Voting

GoChain has implemented a two-phase voting process.
For the initial rollout, the GoChain Foundation will add
the first 50 signers to the authorization list. These original
50 signers will be companies from multiple industries and
spread out across multiple countries. This will help ensure
forced decentralization and avoid interference by any single
government.

Once 50 authorized signers have been established then
voting control will be handed over to the signers to govern
themselves. This voting process is shown in Algorithm 2.
The PoA implementation repurposes several block headers
to pass voting information between nodes.

2.6. Signer Verification

Companies which operate authorized signer nodes will
go through a verification process to ensure their identity is
correct. These validation steps will be automated through
the use of smart contracts on the blockchain.

The PoA implementation provides point-in-time signer
& voting state that we can build upon to provide full
transparency to end users. Combined with the verification
data stored within smart contracts, users can what companies
are running which nodes at any given point.

2.6.1. Company Verification. The first verification step
requires companies to provide their Dun & Bradstreet D-
U-N-S number. This identifier allows voters obtain a D&B
report on the company to view official contact information.
This information will be used to establish communication.
See Figure 2.



Algorithm 2: Vote to add/remove signer
1 foreach block do
2 if block is epoch then
3 clear all votes;
4 end
5 if block candidate set then
6 if signer already voted then
7 clear previous vote;
8 end
9 if block vote = ’yes’ then

10 cast ’yes’ vote;
11 else
12 cast ’no’ vote;
13 end
14 if candidate has absolute majority then
15 if candidate is signer then
16 remove candidate from list;
17 else
18 add candidate to list;
19 end
20 end
21 end
22 end

2.6.2. DNS Verification. A secondary verification step re-
quires companies to add a TXT entry to their DNS records
with a random token. This is a common practice when
verifying domain ownership [28]. GoChain will host a DApp
which generates tokens for requestors and validates DNS
records. Authorized signing nodes can use this DApp to view
the verification. See Figure 3.

2.7. Checkpoints

A checkpoint is a signed snapshot of the current state of
the entire blockchain at a particular block number. It will
contain all non-zero account balances and smart contract
states. Once a checkpoint is generated, all the previous blocks
and data can be removed.

When a new node is started, it will download a recent
checkpoint, then continue retrieving blocks and state from
that point on. This will save hours, if not days, getting in
sync. This means a node can be up and running in minutes.

GoChain will provide a publicly-available, read-only API
to retrieve any historical block so anyone can look up data
by keys. This will be open source so anyone can run this to
keep a full history. We encourage it for further verification
and accountability. This will make it easier to build third
party services such as block explorers.

2.8. Performance and Optimizations

2.8.1. Speed and Volume of Transactions. By using trusted
nodes, transactions can be verified very quickly and the
volume of transactions the network can handle increases by
orders of magnitude. Similar to systems we use everyday
that can handle high volumes, like a Google search or Visa
payments, those systems can handle high load only because
they trust the servers and the network they are running on.

Other factors such as block size and gas limits are
artificially low because of the computation power required
by PoW. By trusting the consensus nodes we can increase
the volume of the network by 100x more than Ethereum
can currently handle. Trusted consensus is used outside
cryptocurrencies in systems such as etcd which can reach
141,578 transaction per second on a 3-node cluster using
modest hardware [?]. Improving throughput is critical as the
growth rate of Ethereum is skyrocketing to an unsustainable
rate. Ethereum runs at 13 tx/second right now; we are
targeting 1,300 tx/second at mainnet launch.



The two major parameters we can tweak are block size
(gas limit) and block times. Due to the fact that we have a
relatively small set of signers (vs the number of miners in
PoW) with known capabilities, we are able to increase the
block size drastically and reduce the block times. This alone
greatly increases the number of transactions per second. As
stated above, the reason you can’t increase block size in
PoW is that it makes the hashing algorithm too hard and
too expensive. GoChain does not have that limitation.

2.8.2. Energy Consumption. Using a trusted network of
authoritative nodes means that there will be no mining. No
mining means there will be no battle between computers to
win blocks and therefore no wasted energy. Nodes will only
require a small fraction of this energy to process transactions,
run smart contracts, and verify blocks.

Ethereum’s estimated energy consumption at the time
of this writing is 14 TWh and rising [32]. Assuming 450W
power usage per server [31], our 50-node cluster will only
use 197.1 MWh or 0.001% of the energy of the Ethereum
network.

2.8.3. Networking. Signers will communicate directly with
each other. This means that the node who just finished

signing will send the just signed block to other signers in
the authorized signers list before sending to a replication
node. This ensures the authorized signers get the information
they need as fast as possible while offloading blockchain and
API queries for the rest of the network to dedicated replica
nodes.

The replication layer exists for non-signer nodes (ev-
eryone else) to request blocks and query the state using a
read-only API. Because the replication layer is read-only, we
can horizontal scale to meet the needs of a global scale set
of users. Figure 6 shows an example of this 3-tier network
strategy.

2.8.4. Storage. The storage requirements to store the entire
blockchain is quite large–Ethereum size is hundreds of
gigabytes and it’s growing rapidly. It can take hours or days
to synchronize to a new node which makes it impractical for
the average user that just wants to send a transaction. There
are newer modes you can run to reduce the size such as fast
and light mode, which reduce the size drastically and that is
a good step in the right direction.

Since GoChain will be handling 100x more transaction
volume, storage becomes much bigger–potentially 100x
bigger. As of this writing, Ethereum transactions average
174 bytes and 700,000 transactions occur per day [29] which
produce 120.4MB of block data per day or 43.9GB per year.
Increasing throughput by 2 orders of magnitude will generate
4.4TB of block data per year. Propagating this across all
23,000 nodes in the Ethereum network [30] would require
101 petabytes.

By limiting the set of nodes operating on the dataset
we reduce the network traffic and storage requirements.
Checkpointing allows nodes to only store the small fraction
of the total blockchain that is required for current process-



ing. Current cloud pricing of $0.022 USD per GB/month
[33] makes storing a copy of the blockchain history only
$1,161.60 USD per year of block data.

2.8.5. The Future. Beyond our initial goals described above,
we have a plan to upgrade the smart contract system to
make it easier and less error prone. Software almost always
contains bugs that are unknown at the time of release and
developers need a way to fix those bugs. Ethereum does
not allow you to upgrade your contracts and that results in
$100’s of millions of value being stolen [7]. We intend to
make writing smart contracts easier to write and easier to
deploy, as well as making them safer to prevent the massive
amounts of theft that is happening. Smart contracts need to
be more like the real world, where they can be amended,
paused, and/or terminated.

We are also adding standardized rulesets to contracts to
define how and when contracts can be modified. We expect
this will help the adoption of smart contracts by the broader
business community by using familiar contract terms. For
example, a co-op organization may require a quorum of
members to change a contract while other organizations may
require all participants in a contract to agree to a change.
GoChain will continue to default contracts to be immutable
by default for compatibility with Ethereum. GoChain will
also add additional security features such as whitelists to
protect access to contracts to minimize attack risk.

3. Conclusion

GoChain is being built to solve fundamental issues
that plague existing cryptocurrencies. The GoChain team
has decades of experience building high scale, distributed
applications and cloud infrastructure. We will apply that to
GoChain to ensure it’s one of the best and most scalable
blockchains on the market. GoChain will be faster, more
scalable, more decentralized and greener.
