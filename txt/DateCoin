About DateCoin

DateCoin is the world’s first dating service that uses neural 
networks and artificial intelligent algorithms based on working 
business model with clear buyback on blockchain.

Today‘s dating services have a lot of  problems, 
including:

DateCoin creates a new reality of  online dating, combining 
advanced, proven technologies and fruitful dating experience.

DateCoin is the next step in the development of the successful project, 
launched in 2015. Its predecessor,  dating service Denim, is today’s market 
leader of pragmatic dating in Russia, with the fast-growing audience and 
high average revenue per user (ARPU).

 — Low efficiency in finding a matching partner.

 — The user wastes a bunch of time looking through boring profiles 
(search settings and filters do not fix the problem).

 — Fake photos and accounts of non-existing girls,  unreliable personal 
information.

 — Hidden subscriptions and payments that drain the money from users 
cards.

 — Weak cybersecurity of the services, confidential data leaks due to 
successful hacking attacks.

DTC holders can sell their tokens on the secondary market, or offer them 
for mandatory buyback by DateCoin. Up to 20% of the project revenue 
will be spent monthly on this purpose, that will positively affect the DTC 
price.

DateCoin Tokens (DTC) is the key to the best girls all 
over the world under special conditions.

The United States is the absolute leader of the dating industry. According to statista.com, 
the projected revenue by the end of 2017 will amount to $2.18 billion. However, the US 
market growth rate is slowing down from year to year, moving from a quantitative indicator 
to a qualitative one. The growing popularity of online dating segment in Europe, Asia and 
South America is worth noting separately. Currently, the top 5 countries for the total forecast 
revenue in 2017 are China, Britain, Germany, France and Brazil, whereas emerging markets 
leaders in 2017-2021 will be China (9.9%) and Brazil (8.6%).

Token mechanism

Tokens buy-back program

We are selling DateCoin (DTC) tokens to to raise funds for the project 
development and scaling of an existing successful business model. 
DateCoin is designed to provide each token holder with clear and 
favorable conditions.

DateCoin gives DTC holders an opportunity to sell their tokens with the 
buyback program. Starting from the fourth quarter of 2018, we plan to 
spend up to 20% of the project revenue for token buyback monthly.

By providing the world’s best dating services to the target audience, we 
plan to reach an annual revenue of up to €230 million by 2021. With an 
investment of €34 million at the launch of the project we will spend more 
than €90 million for token buyback by 2021, with an estimated total of up 
to €185 million by 2023.

DTC owners will be able to sell their tokens on the secondary market or 
offer them for mandatory buyback by DateCoin

Token buyers are given unique access to the best girls 
from all over the world under special conditions.
..........................................................................................

The buyback is made with a smart contract as follows:

 — DateCoin places a fixed price (in ETH) smart contract to buy the 
tokens with the closing date in five calendar days

 — All token holders are informed via DApp (decentralized application) 
about the opportunity to sell tokens

 — As token holders  offer their tokens for sale, the total amount of 
tokens in a smart contract increases

 — The exchange rate equals = #ETH / #tokens. Evidently, the less tokens 
are left in contract, the more favorable is the exchange rate

 — If the  sellers are not satisfied with the current buyback rate, they can 
withdraw their tokens, thus reducing its total number and improving 
the exchange rate for the rest

 — You can send and withdraw tokens before the closing date of the 
smart contract. After this date, the number of tokens is fixed and ETH 
is sent to all participants proportional to the number of tokens left in 
the contract
