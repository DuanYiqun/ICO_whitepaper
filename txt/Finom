Summary 
The world of finance is accessible to everyone 
We use Blockchain technology to create reliable, convenient financial services integrated 
into the financial ecosystem with a single entry point and an intelligent assistant based on 
artificial intelligence (AI). 

In the Finom ecosystem: 

• Any user, regardless of level of experience or size of savings, can easily and 
conveniently use digital currencies and assets;

• Paying with cryptocurrency anywhere in stores is as easy as with a payment card;
• All transactions are transparent and the legitimate origin of funds is instantly 

verifiable;
• Capital moves freely around the world. 

While others make promises, we deliver 

We have been in the cryptocurrency market since 2012. Finom owns 5 operating businesses 
serving 520 000 users around the globe and growing quickly: 

• Nanopool Mining pool is one of the largest altcoin mining pools in the world;
• TabTrader is one of  the most popular terminal for trading cryptocurrencies  

in the world according to Play Market;
• Cryptonit cryptocurrency exchange trusted 2012;
• Cryptal Mining Centers mines Ethereum and has a combined output of 35.000 MH/s;
• Beetle.io offers an easy and straightforward bitcoin buying experience, right from the

smartphone, with credit or debit card.

Legal placement of shares 

On November 1, a private placement of Finom security token via a crowdale will begin  
in accordance with U.S. law. In the United States, accredited investors will invest pursuant  
to Regulation D (Reg. D) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
(the “Securities Act”). Unaccredited investors in the U.S. will not be permitted to participate  
in the offering. 

In each case, the tokens will be subject to resale restrictions designed to facilitate 
compliance with the relevant regulations.  Securities issued in reliance of Reg. D will 
considered “Restricted Securities” and will be subject to a one-year holding period. Following 
the one-year holding period, the tokens will only be tradeable in compliance with Section 
4(a)(7) of the Securities Act on an exchange or ATS approved by Finom.  Currently, Finom 
intends to permit the tokens to trade following the holding period on the SharesPost 
Alternative Trading System, or ATS, to ensure compliance with the Section 4(a)(7) 
requirements.

In order to facilitate compliance, the tokens will only be tradeable on approved token 
exchanges that forbid participation by U.S. persons.  Currently, it is anticipated that the token 
will trade on Finom’s Cryptonit exchange.

Market and Company 

The major market problem 
Access to financial instruments is generally limited to wealthy sophisticated investors due to 
their complexity, diversity and high-dollar entry threshold. We believe that this situation has 
created high demand for simple, accessible integrated financial instruments for users with 
low financial and computer literacy. 

The Underbanked: 2 billion people are excluded from the global 
economy 
Finance industry  professionals, have access to a variety of financial instruments to them. 
Аvailability of a bank card is taken for granted by citizens of advanced economies. At the 
same time over 2 billion people in the global workforce do not have access to financial 
services (according to the World Bank: Washington D.C.). Another figure presented by the 
World Bank is even more staggering: 73% of the world's population does not have a bank 
account. 

The reason for this problem lies in the fact that many banks do not want to do business with 
low-income segments of the population. On the other hand, the poor themselves do not seek 
to participate in formal financial relationships, as they do not understand the benefits they 
can bring. 

The problem concerns not only individuals. There are regions where companies do not 
participate in formal relationships with financial institutions. A total of more than 200 million 
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries do not have access to 
the volume of capital they need. 

Data confirms our hypothesis that access to financial instruments significantly improves 
people's living standards. For example, in Nigeria, families with a savings account in a bank 
or mobile money enjoyed a more balanced diet and planned their food expenditure better.

Minority tool: 0.08% of the population uses cryptocurrencies 
According to experts at the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF), part of the 
University of Cambridge, estimated the number of unique active users of cryptocurrency 
wallets to be in the range of 2.9-5.8 million as of January 2017. 

�   8



 
According to an independent study by Coinbase and ARK InvestResearch, in January 2017, 
more than 10 million people were Bitcoin owners. However, the study did not take other 
cryptocurrencies into account.  

As a percentage, active users of cryptocurrencies account for 0.08% of the world's total  
population. Most of them live in North America and Europe - countries with highly developed 
economies. 

According to coinmap.org on October 3, 2017, only 10.028 companies in the world accept 
cryptocurrency for payment.  

�   �9



Geographical heatmap illustrates that most operations with crypto are offered to users in 
Western Europe, the US and Japan. However, most of them are small companies. 

This concentration is directly dependent on the degree of regulation of 
cryptocurrency: Japan and the United States have already introduced partial 
regulation of cryptocurrencies and legislated their status. In Europe, the market 
practice of payments in bitcoins is well developed in Switzerland, Liechtenstein and 
Luxembourg. In Germany, the Ministry of Finance recognized bitcoin as a payment 
instrument, calling it "private money", from which tax must be collected. 

According to a report by Morgan Stanley released in July 2017, out of 500 of the world's 
largest Internet retailers, only three companies in practice are accepting cryptocurrency. 

At the moment, cryptocurrency owners often prefer to use it as a speculative instrument 
rather than a means of payment. 

For a multifold increase in the volume of the market, cryptocurrencies need to make 
their use ubiquitous in everyday life. Given the low level of financial and computer literacy 
of the population, this can only be achieved by simplifying the user interface and ensuring 
that relevant financial proposals and tools are selected for user tasks. 

How Finom arose 
The European debt crisis, which almost led to the default of the Republic of Cyprus in 2013, 
showed investors around the world that no offshore jurisdiction is a safe place to store their 
assets. It becomes obvious that the current financial system is far from ideal as long as 
states have control over capital. Frightened investors begin to look for new sheltered 
harbors. Some chose Bitcoin. 

Only in the second half of 2013 does Bitcoin's growth began in earnest. At the beginning of 
the year its price was under $100, but by the end of the year the price has reached $1000. 
The rise in prices attracts not only investors but also miners to the market. 

Early in the life of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin  could be mined on a home PC. However, 
profitability of such operations quickly attracts the entry of professional miners with powerful 
expensive equipment. This causes small miners to merge their capacity into so-called pools 
to compete with professional miners. 

In Russia, professional farms are also being established that are engaged in industrial 
mining of cryptocurrencies. One of these farms is created by the serial entrepreneur and 
investor Rustam Kutuev. 

Every day there are new cryptocurrencies being created with the goal of repeating Bitcoin's 
success. The variety of coins gives the miners the opportunity to choose the coin that is 
profitable to mine at any given moment. The situation begins to resemble a gold rush. 

It is during this period that the  Russian programming trio Anton Trusov, Vladislav Alushkin 
and Alexander Barkovsky acquire their first GPUs and begin to mine Ethereum. However, in 
a few days, the only pool for mining Ethereum closes registration of new users. To continue 
mining, the three unite and start developing their own pool. The team rolled out their own 
pool within month, called Nanopool. Within a year they connect new currencies and the pool 
becomes their main project. 

With an effective mining solution, cryptocurrency could be obtained, but how and 
where could it be sold? And what those who are not  miners, but just want to invest? In 

�   �10



response to market requests, exchanges, exchangers and other intermediaries begin to 
appear, offering to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. A pair of Bitcoin enthusiasts, Konstantin 
Karatov and Andrei Yanukovich, created a cryptocurrency exchange called Cryptonit, which 
allows users to buy cryptocurrencies for fiat currency and freely trade them with other 
participants. 

The number of cryptocurrency exchanges is increasing every year, so that it becomes 
difficult for investors to keep track of constantly changing quotes. Kirill Suslov, a financier by 
education, created a platform to track and trade cryptocurrencies on different exchanges 
through one convenient service. Kirill and a team of talented programmers launched 
TabTrader appears, an application for mobile devices that allows users to trade 
cryptocurrency directly from their phone. The team connects almost all existing exchanges, 
which delivers a combined trading volume comparable to the volume of the world's fifth-
largest crypto exchange. 

The cryptocurrency market is still very small., The creators of Nanopool, Cryptonit, 
TabTrader and Cryptal begin to collaborate and share their thoughts on development and the 
problems facing the Blockchain technology market. The difficulties they see for ordinary 
users are identical: high commission, difficulty accessing tools and the general inefficiency of 
the financial system. And although each of the businesses has its own role, the future vision 
of the founders is the same: financial freedom for every inhabitant of the planet. A system 
that guarantees low fees, no intermediaries, fast payments around the world, full control over 
personal finances and access to the whole world’s capital. 

This vision rallies the team, which sets a goal of making finance accessible to everyone on 
the planet. 

Our Vision: new finance system 
We plan to realize this goal by creating a standard financial blockchain system - one 
system in the interests of everyone: 

• Any user is free to use digital assets;
• Paying with cryptocurrency anywhere in the world is easier than with a payment card;
• All transactions are transparent and the legitimate origin of funds is instantly verifiable;
• The markets are not subject to external manipulation;
• Capital moves freely around the world.

Finom Ecosystem  

Intellectual Blockchain Ecosystem 
We are already using blockchain technology to create reliable, convenient financial services. 
We see the further development of the company in the integration of new and existing 
services into a Blockchain ecosystem with a single entry point and an intelligent assistant 
(AI). The purpose of this ecosystem is to open the world of finance to the general public. 

Benefits within the Finom ecosystem for: 

• Users
Every user of the system, regardless of level of experience, will be able to easily use 
financial instruments. A single account provides easy access to asset management tools. 
Transactions take place with minimal commission. Users can invest or receive money direct, 
bypassing intermediaries. 

• Miners
A single account allows miners to link a wallet and  card to their office. Miners will be able to 
pay for their purchases with  cryptocurrency. Intellectual selection algorithms will find the 
most profitable currencies for mining at any given time. 

• Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs gain access to new financial instruments and the ability to legally work with 
cryptocurrencies: accepting and receiving payments, paying taxes and wages. 

• The state
The state receives an instrument of legalization and regulation of the cryptocurrency market. 
We create a transparent structure with an identification system that meets international 
requirements: AML/ KYC. 

• Developers
Open API enables developers to create new services and aggregators based on Finom 
services. 

• Investors
With Finom, every person on Earth, regardless of level of income, can become an investor. 
The use of Blockchain technology will allow investment in those assets that were previously 
available only to institutional investors. 

Construction Stages of the Finom Ecosystem  
The construction of an intelligent ecosystem will occur in several stages: 

1. Integrated infrastructure on the basis of existing services  

Identification system for users with a single account: we provide access to all Finom 
ecosystem services. 

�   15



Current users get easy access to buying, selling and mining of cryptocurrencies. Users 
save due to the lack of commission within the ecosystem.

2. Financing products, bespoke payment system

Possibility to pay both with cryptocurrencies and fiat payment card or mobile app. 

Users of traditional financing products can: 
• Use a new kind of financial instrument (p2p loans, p2p factoring, insurance);
• Invest in any assets tokenized on the platform, receiving tools previously only

available to institutional and other major investors.

People who do not have access to financial instruments get access to financing products 
via their smartphone. 

Experienced users of cryptocurrency receive integrated financing products, thanks to 
which they can easily operate with traditional and digital assets via one interface. 

3. Integration of third-party services into the ecosystem

The widest choice of services, as well as the most profitable offers, gleaned from the entire 
world market in one system. This step will attract even more experienced users, simplify 
market entry for new ones and keep them within the system. 

4. AI Assistant - simplification of financial decision-making

Users, depending on their behavior in the ecosystem, will receive personalized offers 
on investment and cost optimization (AI assistant) in accordance with their activity. 

User activities can be of three types: 

• The user knows exactly what he needs and independently chooses the tools inside
the system;

• The user knows the type of solution needed to resolve the problem and looks
for the most advantageous option: a deposit, loan, Bitcoin rate, mining pool etc.

• The user knows only the result they want to achieve for example increase savings
from $100 to $200. The system offers an array of options with projected terms
and risks in percentages, the ability to automatically assemble a portfolio, setting
the parameters "timeframe" and "risks".

The system regularly evaluates the urgency of the decisions made by the user under current 
market conditions and signals if there are more advantageous offers available at any given 
moment. 
AI helps in all aspects of the business by minimizing costs and predicting the future.  
For example it can eliminate fraud by analyzing common recurring patterns of fraudulent 
behavior. 

This step will drastically reduce market entry hurdles for users with low levels of financial 
and computer literacy, increase the flow of money into the system, the number and volume 
of transactions, and also keep users within the system.

commission from trades done via the TabTrader terminal. Revenue comes from sharing up 
to half of commission. Average exchange commission is 0.25%.  

There are about 115 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Trading volume is highly 
concentrated on the largest exchanges with 3 of them controlling more than 50% of trading 
volume. Total 24 hour trading volume of all exchanges is over $3 billion. This equals $1.08 
trillion per year. 
Thus, the total available market is $1.37 billion per year ($1.095 trillion * 0.25% * 0.5). 

The total trading volume that goes via Tabtrader is $0.935 billion  year. It is only 0.9% of total 
available market.  
The majority of the largest crypto exchanges don’t share commission with TabTrader.

take into consideration that total market capitalization has grown 9 times YTD and will 
continue to grow in the future. 

In order to reach the target we will introduce the following roadmap.

registered users. The exchange has existed since 2012 and is registered in Great Britain. 

www.cryptonit.net 

Introduction 
The cryptocurrency exchange market is a worldwide market allowing buying and selling of 
more than 1000 cryptocurrencies and more than 200 cryptoassets as of 2017. It is 
represented by a number of exchange services worldwide with a total average turnover of 
$8.7 billion per day in nov 2017. In May 2017 daily trading turnover reached $4.3 billion, 
nearing stock exchange volumes. Current market cap is calculated as a multiple of average 
price by the number of issued tokens has reached $192 billion. 

According to CoinMarketCap  
 
 
Industry earnings estimates 
There are several common ways to generate revenue: deducting a fee from a deposit 
amount, deducting a fee from withdrawal amount and applying a fee to a trading operation 
that takes place on an exchange.  

Let’s calculate a weighted average trading commission that occurs today on the biggest 
exchanges: 

 

�   �25

http://www.cryptonit.net


*The estimate was made in June 2017 
 
Thus, we get a weighted average of about 0.23%. 

Estimated daily revenue generated by the exchange industry is $6 million per day.  It is 
difficult to estimate the total number of people that are using Bitcoin today, but let’s assume 
2.9-5.8m users. We see that the market is far from saturation because the number of people 
involved in “cryptoeconomics” can be increased much more, generating considerably more 
revenue for exchanges. 

 
Operations  

Business model 
Cryptonit is a digital market. That means that a registered user may deposit FIAT money or 
cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum) and perform trading with other registered users. 
Cryptonit has a system allowing users to set ask/ bid orders to match supply and demand of 
FIAT and Bitcoin mass. That means Cryptonit acts like a trading platform; we take and hold 
user funds (FIAT or cryptocurrency) giving the opportunity to trade with each other and 
withdraw funds upon the user’s request. 

Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are executed automatically. All FIAT deposits and 
withdrawals are checked by the staff and executed manually after appropriate checks and 
confirmations. Cryptonit charges a fee for funding and withdrawal operations as well as 
trading operations.

Company legal framework 
As stated above, Bitcoin is a new phenomenon and there is no common legal international 
definition of it. There is no standard regulatory approach. Our company is incorporated in 
England and Wales and we put maximum effort into being transparent under UK jurisdiction. 
The closest business sphere is traditional currency trading (Forex). These businesses are 
regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC). 

By partnering with leading UK based legal firm Sheridans LLP, Cryptonit has established a 
dialogue with FCA and HMRC. Following our official request the FCA has provided an official 
response to Cryptonit stating that our business is currently exempt from regulation. In order 
to obtain correct tax classification Cryptonit has been registered with HMRC as a Money 
Service Business (MSB). MSB classification is “bureau de change”. This is an obligatory 
accreditation for financial exchange related businesses. 
To describe our principal business operations we entered the UK registry (SIC) “64999 - 
Financial intermediation not elsewhere classified”. This is the area of operation which best 
resembles cryptocurrency exchange. 

Sales and profit forecast 
Cryptonit’s aim is to occupy a share of 2% of total cryptocurrency trading volume in 2 years 
and become a TOP 15 cryptocurrency exchange. Many specialists predict exponential 
market growth. Let’s take into account one of the the most pessimistic market growth 
scenarios - linear growth year on year. 

�   �27



"

Based on this analysis we foresee Cryptonit’s monthly revenue being $6.6 million by the 
end of 2019.  

Competitors 
Let’s look at the closest competitors and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. 

1) Bitstamp - an EU licensed cryptocurrency exchange that makes a public audit of
assets. However, as Bitcoin dominance rate keeps decreasing Bitstamp falls behind
by not adding new cryptocurrencies that are in strong demand from customers.

2) Bitfinex - an old Hong Kong exchange.
Bitfinex has had serious security problems in the past that made it lose users’ crypto
assets. That decreased user trust in the exchange. At the same time Bitfinex is
continuously experiencing difficulties with the US dollar and deteriorating banking
relationships that make deposits and withdrawals difficult.

3) Kraken - the largest Bitcoin exchange by EUR volume. Operating since 2011 it has
problems with US dollar operations and high operational costs, making its support
queue one of the longest in the industry. Verification issues are being resolved within
1-3 weeks.

4) Poloniex - a US exchange with significant market share. However, Poloniex has an
unclear legal status in the US and nontransparent terms of service that brings the
service no shortage of critics. Additionally its weak technical infrastructure makes the
site go down comparatively often, as per users’ feedback continuously posted in the
site’s online chat,

Taking into consideration most common weaknesses of its competitors, Cryptonit is seeking 
to build a unique service combining the following key advantages:  

• Transparent legal structure and integrated audit
• Fast and efficient user verification procedure
• Popular and widespread account funding methods: credit cards, instant bank

payments, cash, debit cards
• Close integration with other holding products
• Constant security monitoring and strict security policies
• Powerful revamped trading engine handling 1 million transactions per second

Cryptal Mining Center (SC) 

Summary 
Current power: 35.000 Mh/s 
Using modern Nvidia and AMD GPUs, the farm produces the cryptocurrency Ethereum. 

Construction of mining centers 
We see great potential in increasing the capacity of industrial mining centers. 

For the construction of one industrial mining site the following items are required: 

Infrastructure: 
• The building is 2000 sq.m. (80m by 25m). The height of the building is 7 meters. 
• The plot is 3000 sq.m. 
• Power of electricity supplied to the building: 2 megawatts for mining and 100 

kilowatts for auxiliary purposes 

Calculation of cost 

• Plot of land - $500,000. The land is acquired in ownership to protect the project from 
possible risks associated with refusal to extend the lease. 

• Building construction, engineering, electrical connection - 1.500.000 USD 
  
Equipment 
  
Mining ETH, ETC, XMR, ZEC 
To mine these currencies, we will use prefabricated units based on the NVIDIA GTX1060 
6GB and the NVIDIA GTX1070 8GB chips 
The block consists of 12 cards. Consumption per unit is 1.5 and 1.9 kW respectively. 
In one center we will install 1000 such machines. 

Mining BTC, BCC, DGB-SHA, DASH, DGB, LTC, XVG 
The following equipment will be used for these currencies: Antminer D3, Antminer L3 +, 
Antminer S9-14TH/s. 
Total: 2.100 machines. 

�   �32



Data on revenue, based on exchange rates and computational complexity as of 02.10.2017: 

Total cost of equipment: 9.020.780 USD. 
The total cost of running a single mining center: 

Construction of the building, purchase of land and power supply - $2.000.000 
Purchase of equipment - $9.020.780 

Total: $11.020.780 

ROI of the project 

Revenues 
Revenue per month is 1.763.610 USD. 

Costs 

�   �33



To calculate the cost variable, take the cost of electricity to be $0.07 , which is the average 
for most countries. The total capacity of the mining center will be 4,640 kW. The cost of 
electricity is 233.856 USD. The cost of maintenance will be 6 000 USD. 
 
Gross profit per month (revenue minus costs) = $1.523.754.00 

A base payback period for the project will be just over 7 months. 

We plan to build 8 such centers in countries with cheap gas and electricity: Canada, the US 
and Sweden. 

Thus, the total  investment in mining centers will be 88 million USD. 

Mining center Roadmap 

• Search and purchase of land, design - 1 month 
• Building construction - 4 months 
• Ordering equipment for delivery - 3 months 
• Receiving permits for commissioning - 1 month 

The total duration of the project will be 6 months.

Beetle.io (HK) 

Summary 
• Beetle makes it possible to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum using a payment card
• The app is available on Android, iOS and web platform
• At the moment, the number of active users exceeds 5.000
• iOS application
• Google Play application 

One of the first questions that every person asks themselves when they get to know about 
Bitcoin is "how do I buy it?" The growing use of smartphones is one example of the looming  
high-tech revolution of the 21st century. Most people get acquainted with Bitcoin via 
smartphone. The demand for buying Bitcoin direct from a smartphone is soaring. Nowadays 
people want to do everything on the go. Beetle offers an easy and straightforward Bitcoin 
purchase experience direct from a smartphone with a credit or debit card. After bitcoin is 
purchased the user can use it whenever they need it via a simple and transparent interface. 

Sales and profit forecast 
The total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds 190 bln USD, with 8.7 bln USD total 
daily trading volumes (source: Coinmarketcap.com cumulative data). 

Total market capitalization is expected to grow to 1 trillion USD by end of 2019, with 50 
billion daily trading volumes.  

Beetle is already serving more than 5000 users without any promotion. With the launch  
of advertising we expect to be growing by 10,000 users per month throughout 2017-2019. 
Based on these growth estimates we expect to achieve 200,000 active monthly users.  

We can draw 3 sales/ profit scenarios: pessimistic, medium and optimistic. The key indicator 
which we set is the % of active users which convert into  paying customers.  

"

The average amount the user spends on buying bitcoin via the app is 89 USD. 

We can further draw the monthly sales projection, the number of paying customers 
multiplied by the average amount spent 

"

Beetle aims to sell bitcoin at market rate without earning on spreads, but rather enclose  
an additional fee on top of the fee which is charged by the card payment processing 
companies. The current average fee charged for payment processing for bitcoin businesses 
is 3%. We plan to add 7% on top of the fee, meaning 93% comprises the value of goods 
sold. Let’s draw monthly gross profit projections:

Operations 

How is the service produced and delivered? 

Beetle interacts with the Cryptonit exchange backend core via API. Cryptonit and Beetle run 
on the same database. The user creates an account on Beetle, chooses the amount to 
spend, verifies their identity and proceeds to the payment gateway. After payment is 
captured, the corresponding amount is used to purchase the bitcoins for the user on 
cryptonit.net. The purchased bitcoins instantly appear in the user’s wallet on the app. The 
user is free to leave the bitcoins on the app wallet or send them to any desired address. 
Cryptonit.net provides liquidity for the app, manages backend operations and client 
verification/ support. You can think of Beetle as mobile Bitcoin broker. 

Location  

The service is available globally.

Financing and insurance services 
Further development of Finom is possible only in parallel with the launch of its own financing 
services, which will significantly expand the capabilities of our customers around the world. 
We will provide access to financial instruments in the field of Blockchain technology blocking, 
as well as to classic financing services for businesses and individuals. 

Payment system for legal entities and private persons, B2B financial services
The payment system will allow online retail and other organizations on the network to collect 
payments for their customers in the most popular crypto and fiat currencies in one day. 
Provision of processing of plastic cards. 

Universal multi-currency wallet

A reliable wallet in which you can store any cryptocurrencies, create and manage a 
cryptocurrency portfolio, transfer and receive funds. 

Card payments

The issuing of debit cards will enable customers around the world to pay for purchases from 
their multi-currency wallet, withdrawing money in the currency which is most profitable. At the 
same time, the exchange of cryptocurrency for fiat takes place at the spot exchange rate. 
This is possible due to the fact that the conversion operation is conducted on our own 
exchange, Cryptonit. 

Digitilzation and tokenization of assets

Many investment tools are sold for lots or indivisible blocks (shares, bonds, real estate). It 
means that the cost of one unit might reach thousands, sometimes even hundreds of 
thousands dollars. In other words, lot determines the necessary size of the capital, which 
makes many tools inaccessible for majority of people. We want to change this situation: the 
size of the capital should determine the size of the lot. For this purpose we will create a 
system of digitilization and tokenization of assets. In this way people with small savings will 
be able to get access to the very same tools that the big investors have. 

P2P loans

P2P loans are a convenient tool for providing and receiving loans by private individuals, in 
which the intermediary in the form of a bank is not required and users provide loans to each 
other direct. 
The main advantage for borrowers is low interest rates (due to the absence of an 
intermediary in the form of a bank), and for the investor in the ability to flexibly set rates 
depending on market conditions and the borrower's rating, as well as independently form a 
loan portfolio. 

Finom provides an ecosystem in which transactions are recorded, borrowers rated and loan 
offer data is stored. 

Factoring

Business needs quick ways to replenish working capital, so factoring is widely used in cases 
where it is more convenient for a supplier to sell its receivables at a discount to the bank than 
to wait for the buyer to pay the bill. Blockchain technology will help to solve this issue more 
elegantly by eliminating the intermediary in the form of a bank. 

Finom will offer the market an online platform whereby legal entities will be able to "sell" their 
invoices through P2P financing technology directly to investors. Private investors, in turn, 
 will be able to receive income from a business that was previously only available to credit 

�   42



institutions. 

The advantages of using Blockchain and P2P financing technology lie in lower transaction 
costs compared to classical factoring, in the possibility of risk sharing between a large 
number of investors and the minimum participation amount for an investor. 

In practice, the process works as follows: 

• The supplier ships the goods or provides the service, receives from the buyer (debtor) an
invoice (invoice, certificate of work performed). The contract provides for  deferred
payment.

• The seller registers this invoice in an online system. Participants of the transaction are
checked, the invoice is tokenized and becomes available to investors.

• Investors see a tokenized invoice on the FINOM platform and make stock quotes (bids)
containing information about which part of the invoice they are willing to buy and at what
price.

• The supplier analyzes the offers from investors, chooses the best, and as a result
receives cash. The right to receive cash goes to the investor.The distribution of investor
shares is fixed in a smart contract, which is recorded on a distributed ledger. When the
the invoice matures, the buyer (the debtor) transfers the money to the smart contract,
and the smart contract automatically distributes the funds between the investors.

Sale of tokenized shares 
Placement of tokenized shares in accordance with US law 
Tokens are placed in accordance with Regulation D (Rule 506(c) of Regulation D) of the 
U.S. Securities Act of 1933. 

Work on Regulation D means that Finom tokens can only be acquired by accredited 
investors from the United States. 

Legal support in the offering in the US is provided by leading law firm Perkins Coie (https://
www.perkinscoie.com) and in Switzerland by Meyerlustenberger Lachenal Ltd (www.mll-
legal.com). 

More details about the rules for posting tokens can be found in the PPM (private placement 
memorandum), which can be downloaded from finom.io. 

Tokenized shares 

What is a token? 
Issued tokens are securities that certify the following rights of investors: 

• Right to receive a portion of company profit in the form of dividends 

• Right to participate in community management  

• Right to a portion  of company assets 

Share placement structure 

Issued tokens: 113.300.000

Price of 1 token: $2  

Utility-token 
In addition to FIN security token issuance, Finom is issuing NOM utility-tokens. 1 FIN token 
entitles 1 NOM token. While purchasing the FIN security tokens each investor receives the 
corresponding  equal  amount  of  utility-tokens  as a bonus. The amount of NOM tokens is 
capped by initial issuance and equals 113 300 000. 

NOM tokens  will start listing on largest cryptocurrency excahnge after the Token sale is 
finished. As of November 2017 negotiations are taking place with Bittrex.com, Exmo.me, 
CEX.io, Yobit.net, Bitfinex.com, Wex.nz, MercadoBitcoin.com.br, Livecoin.net, Liqui.io, 
Cryptopia.co.nz, Binance.com, and also Cryptonit.net. 

NOM token serves as an internal currency within the Finom ecosystem, and also provides a 
set of priviliges for tokenholders:

5.Paying for advertising impressions.
NOM tokens will allow buying of advertising spots within the ecosystem and partner
servies, and also the sites with growing audience. After the NOM tokens have been used
for payment, they will be repeatedly listed on exchanges.

Tokens lock-ups 

55% of FIN and NOM tokens are reserved within the company and are subject to lock-ups 
until 2020. The lock-up mechanism will be incorporated into the ERC-20 smartcontract.  

• 15.01.2020 releasing 15% FIN and 15% NOM;
• 15.07.2020 releasing 20% FIN and 20% NOM;
• 15.01.2021 releasing 20% FIN and 20% NOM.  

The remaining 45% of FIN tokens are offered in the tokensale and within one year are 
tradable on Cryptonit.  

The remaining 45% of NOM tokens are offered in the tokensale and are freely tradeable.

�   �54

Company 55.0%

For Sale 45.0%



Advantages for investors

Dividends 
The result of the token sale will be a significant increase in current business, bringing instant 
profit increases. We forecast that current performance will continue to bring in profits. Part of 
the profit received by Finom for the reporting period will be distributed as dividends to all 
token holders. We plan to distribute up to 20% of net earnings in dividends. 

Price increases 
As the development of current services and the opening of new ones continues, it can be 
assumed that the price of the FIN token will grow as the value of shares of technology 
companies tends to increase under similar conditions. 

Escrow 
Our most important priority is the safety of funds that were entrusted to us by investors. To 
ensure the highest level of security, the funds raised when selling tokens via Regulation D 
will be deposited to the escrow account of our US partner and transferred to the Finom 
account after the transfer of tokenized shares to investors. 

Liquidity 
From March 2018, Following the lock-up period, Finom tokens are expected to be traded on 
Cryptonit. Only investors who are not U.S. persons will be permitted to trade.  

Residents of the United States are expected to be able to trade tokens on the licensed ATS 
(Alternative Trading System) site run by SharesPost after expiration of the lock-up period.
