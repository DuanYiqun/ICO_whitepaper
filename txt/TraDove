Significant changes in the commercial world have occurred in the past twenty years. The explosive 

growth of the Internet accompanied by the creation of social networks has made information ubiquitous. 

Smart phones and mobile devices put the world in our palms. Facebook and LinkedIn enable 

instantaneous direct relationships among and between individuals on opposite sides of the world. 

Yet B2B lags behind. In this space, information is Balkanized. Potential business partners in the same 

town may not be aware of one another. Transparency is lacking. Even after identifying a potential 

business partner, that potential partner’s “business quality” is often difficult to appraise. In the consumer 

space, peer opinions are easily available using Yelp or Google Review. This is not the case in the B2B 

space, where targeted marketing is much more difficult. 

Ultimately, trust is a problem. How can we determine whether a company or company executive with 

whom we have never done business is trustworthy? How can we assure that we will be paid for goods or 

services we deliver?  

Google is not well-suited for this because most Google information is consumer-oriented. Google 

information is less B2B relevant. Without substantial modification of its “Friend Circles”, Facebook is not 

B2B compatible. To adapt successfully to B2B, LinkedIn products would have to be substantially 

redesigned.

The TraDove Business Social Network 

TraDove was born to address these problems: 

1. How do you find business partners quickly and credibly? 

2. How do you assure the quality of potential business partners and the quality of products/services you 

plan to purchase? 

3. How do you market your B2B products/services to hidden demands in a targeted way? 

4. How do you assure that you will be paid for what you deliver or get what you paid for? 

TraDove Value Proposition 

A business social network connects corporate 
buyers, sellers and others to interconnected 
products/services and companies in a fashion that: 
 
1. Shortens the search cycle and identifies 

potential business partners in a credible way 
2. Makes B2B more transparent and shortens due 

diligence time and effort (w/ references, 
endorsements, etc.) 

3. Does precision-based company-to-company 
advertising over the Internet 

4. Enhances trust in B2B dealings and payments 
 

 
 

A major goal of TraDove’s B2B 2.0 is to ensure and maintain credibility, both within and outside the 

network. There are several ways to achieve this. Basic authentication of potential network members is at 

the first level. TraDove has developed a proprietary process to vet potential new members efficiently. 

Once in, democratic ratings like those deployed by LinkedIn or Yelp maintain a member’s credibility level. 

This activity is extremely important. It is a device that helps maintain a perception of TraDove’s network 

quality.

Many companies currently promoting or offering tokens are in the concept stage. TraDove is not. 

TraDove’s Business Social Network has been in operation for five years and rests on a mature web 

platform (https://www.tradove.com) and iOS mobile app (https://app.tradove.com/app/download).  

We now have 250,000+ corporate users, 100,000+ companies from 80+ countries including 200+ Fortune 

1000 companies. We have teams in Silicon Valley, US, China and Geneva, Switzerland and investors, 

advisors and consultants in most major economies: US, China, Germany, Japan, UK, Switzerland and 

South America.

Unlike a consumer social network such as Facebook or a professional network such as LinkedIn, TraDove 

Business Social Network puts substantially more emphasis on traffic quality than on traffic quantity. We 

do not seek nor do we need hundreds of millions of users. We only need tens of millions of users. A 

business user’s value is much higher than a professional user, which is in turn higher than that of a 

consumer user. Facebook paid $42 per consumer user for WhatsApp. Microsoft paid $60 per professional 

user for LinkedIn. How much is a TraDove business user worth? The answer is A LOT!  

Our emphasis on traffic quality and not just quantity keeps our operational costs low and increases both 

business users’ value and our profit margins.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LinkedIn is not suitable for business. It does not authenticate its users. Most use public emails. Faking a 

LinkedIn profile is easy. It is too general and crowded. Most use LinkedIn for personal and professional 

relations oriented communication. It does not have product/service component. 

TraDove has developed a proprietary process to authenticate its users in its general network. It is much 

harder to fake a profile. It is a social network tailored for corporate buying and selling people. It 

seamlessly connects business people, products/services and companies together to share knowledge, 

experience and opportunity in a much more relevant way. 

B2B 2.0 is a person-to-person connector, a business-purpose social network. B2B 1.0 is more product 

oriented (directory or marketplace). In a directory or marketplace, you as a seller passively wait for a 

buyer to find you. In B2B 2.0, you can actively look for potential buyers – a game changer! In the B2B 2.0 

model, we let buyers and sellers find one another and maintain a relationship in return for membership 

and opportunity fees (e.g., opportunity to advertise and pitch to buyers) in BBCoins.

SAP/Oracle/Salesforce provide business utilities, information and process management. TraDove 

provides business opportunities by bringing business partners together. 

Yammer/Chatter are designed principally for intracompany connections. Slack can be used for 

intercompany, but it is general purpose. TraDove specifically provides intercompany business networking 

and collaboration designed to enhance business partnerships.

 Technologies used on TraDove Business Social Network Platform https://www.tradove.com  

Our core business widely leverages Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. Big Data and 

Machine Learning streamline buyer-seller interactions. Results are then fed back using a series of 

business logic programs to assist buyers, sellers and other users in close to real time on both mobile sites 

and websites. Security is on our minds every moment of every day! Our global data center deploys secure 

interface connections between two main offices, one in the United States and one in China. Our web 

interfaces are firewalled and secured with Virtual Private Networks around the world. Security is built into 

the core design and implementation of TraDove’s backend infrastructure. 

Social Network Technology: TraDove uses both open and proprietary social network technologies along 

with mechanisms for connection, networking and collaboration among business people, 

products/services and companies. 

Big Data and Business Mapping: Since the launch 

of TraDove five years ago, we have accumulated a 

large inventory of B2B data spanning people, 

products/services and companies. We can now map 

who is doing business with whom in the same 

manner as social mapping of friends is done on 

Facebook. 
 

Artificial Intelligence: We support the active growth of our user and business databases with a wide 

range of AI technologies such as NLP, LR, RNN,FM and DNN to facilitate buyer-seller interactions, 

including, but not limited to, matching potential business partners, product/service and company 

recommendations and expressed needs alert services. When combined, these services significantly 

improve our users’ business efficiency.  

B2B Marketing Cloud: We have a world wide storage network and along with other content delivery 

technologies, can quickly upload, store and deliver B2B marketing collaterals such as white papers, 

product pictures, product videos and other web contents to global users based on geographic distances 

to users.

Technologies Used for Mobile App  

(Available now in the App Store by searching B2B social network or click from mobile phones 

https://app.tradove.com/app/download) 

We deploy the latest mobile and server technologies to connect users anywhere at any time. Users can do 

live chat, group chat, and share pictures/videos/documents, all through our app. They can easily import 

their contacts into our app, and we take care of the rest, ensuring that their most important business 

partners stay in their business circles. Using our proprietary machine learning algorithm, we can discover 

potential connections between parties and send invites to their mobile phones. In our app, partners can 

be managed by category or by group, significantly boosting productivity and making communication and 

collaboration more efficient than email and SMS. Last but not least, our app is coming to Android! Soon, 

99% of our users will have our state-of-the-art B2B social app at their fingertips.

To solve the fundamental B2B trust problem, in 

international trade in particular, TraDove will use 

BBCoins and blockchain technology – smart 

contracts and smart wallets, for example. We will 

assure that, after successful delivery of products or 

services, companies get paid. 

Roadmap & Milestones 

We are close to reaching critical mass. Our BBCoin token offering will provide capital for marketing and 

user acquisition that will significantly reduce the time to achieve it.  

We provide B2B Marketing Cloud services that allow companies to store their marketing collateral (white 

papers, specifications, pictures, videos, etc.). We apply machine learning to large databases to match 

business partners and recommend products/services and companies. We have begun use of blockchain 

technology to solve trust problems in B2B deal-making and payments. 

 Business (Social) Network – Done 

 Critical Mass – Ongoing 

 B2B Cloud for Marketing Material (Specs, 
White Paper, Video, etc.) – Ongoing 

 B2B Big Data, Machine Learning Matching 
and Business Mapping– Ongoing 

 Blockchain for B2B Trust and International 
Trade Payment - Next Step 

 
Token offering funds will accelerate our ability to 
achieve the following milestones:   
 
Please note the above-mentioned milestones 
are for information only and do not constitute 
any binding commitment from TraDove, its 
officers or its operations team.

Our ultimate vision is to build a global TRUSTWORTHY B2B 2.0 ecosystem connecting business people, 

products/services and companies and to make this ecosystem a go-to place for B2B precision advertising 

similar to Google and Facebook consumer space advertising. 

Driving Up Corporate Demand and Usage for BBCoins in B2B Sales, Advertising and Payment 

Tradove’s BBCoin offering, one of the first B2B-related coin offerings in the market, establishes corporate 

demand for blockchain tokens. To accelerate demand for BBCoins and an increase in their value, we will 

take four tactical steps. 

Empower Buyer & Seller Interactions 

 

 

 



 

12 

 

Empower B2B Precision Advertising 

 

 

Use Blockchain to Facilitate International Trade  

 

 

 

 

 



 

13 

 

 

 

 Fast and instantaneous (Letter of Credit is tedious and time-consuming) 

 No paperwork (Letter of Credit is paper-intensive) 

 Very low cost (Letter of Credit is very expensive) 

 Use collective credibility of participating companies (Letter of Credit uses central credibility of a 

bank) 

Corporate world sales, advertising and payment demand opens up the corporate universe for blockchain 

tokens. TraDove is leading the way! 

BBCoin Demand & User Growth Forecast 

 

Year 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 

Users    230,000    300,000    1,000,000    2,000,000    4,000,000    8,000,000    12,000,000

BBCoin Creation 

TraDove will create an ERC20 standard token (“BBCoin”) on the Ethereum platform and will issue such 

tokens to Ethereum wallets. 

BBCoin Allocations 

Potential corporate demand in our ecosystem for 
BBCoins for B2B sales, marketing and international trade 
can be in the tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.  
 
TraDove issues 1,000,000,000 BBCoins 

 50% or 500,000,000 released for the token offering 

 5% or 50,000,000 used over the next 3-5 years, 
airdropped to our buying and sales users to acquire 
users, encourage users to invite others and 
incentivize their sales and advertising interactions. 
This will also incentivize their companies to use more 
BBCoins on our platforms and buy BBCoins from the 
open market. The airdrop will be strictly disciplined, 
so as not to affect the market 

 20% or 200,000,000 reserved for marketing, user 
acquisition and other needs. Again, use of tokens will 
be strictly disciplined with market conditions 

 15% or 150,000,000 reserved for future company 
usage 

 10% or 100,000,000 reserved mostly for the team and 
some for stakeholders. There is also a 6-month lock-
up period after the ICO. After that, monthly sales 
limits apply. For team awards, there will be a vesting 
period of 4 years spreading the token award on a 
monthly basis over a 48-month period starting from 
their first date at the job

Allocation of Raised Funds 

TraDove plans to raise a $52,000,000 hard cap 
through this token offering, with a 0.16 USD listing 
price and 0.12 USD presale price. We plan to do 
$36M for presale and $16M for public sale, totaling 
400M tokens. We will use 100M tokens as bonuses 
for big purchasers and early birds. We will burn the 
leftover tokens.  

 30% of the proceeds will be used for marketing, 
user acquisition, etc. 

 24% of the proceeds will be used for product 
development, team hiring, network 
infrastructure 

 40% of the proceeds will be reserved for 
compliance, tax and other uses 

 6% for token offering related costs including 
legal, marketing and token offering team, etc.
