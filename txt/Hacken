The Hacken Ecosystem is a community driven business organization 

that will result from this token sale and will be incorporated in a number 

of jurisdictions Worldwide. It consists of the HackenProof bug bounty 

marketplace, Unreported Zero-Day Remuneration Platform, Hacken 

Cybersecurity Startups Incubator, Cybersecurity Analytics Center and 

HackIT Conference. 

Hacken (HKN) is an ERC20 token, which is the only payment tool 

allowed in the Hacken Ecosystem. Buying Hackens today, will allow 

one to receive high quality cybersecurity services in the future, at an 

attractive price. 

Please bear in mind, that all the financial data and legal documentation 

related to this token sale are available separately from this white paper 

upon request.

Summary

This white paper explains key business components of the Hacken Ecosystem. 

It also details the sale of Hacken tokens, which will start at 00:00 EET

on October 12, 2017 and will end at 00:00 EET on November 11, 2017.

The paper also explains the subsequent roadmap for building the

Hacken Ecosystem, should the token sale reach its target milestones.

$32M stolen from Parity and $7.4M from Coindash in 2017, $72M from 

Bitfinex in 2016, $5.1M from Bitstamp in 2015, $65M from Mt. Gox in 

2014. These are gruesome fiat equivalents lost to hackers by various 

cryptocurrency infrastructure projects.

According to Tyler Moore of Tulsa’s Tandy School of Computer Science, 

since bitcoin’s inception in 2009 to March 2015, around 33% of all bitcoin 

exchanges during that period were hacked. Cryptocurrencies certainly 

are not the only businesses distressed by hackers. US President Donald 

Trump, himself a subject of a recent cybersecurity controversy, stated that 

cybertheft is the fastest growing crime in the United States by far.

This presidential concern is followed by big money. The United States 

will invest over $19B in cybersecurity as a part of the 2017 Federal 

Budget. This figure is up from the $14B budgeted in 2016, by the Obama 

Administration.

Unfortunately, there is not enough talent to make use of these 

enormous financial resources. According to CyberSeek there are more 

than 348,000 open cybersecurity positions in 2017, and this number will 

be up to 1.8M by 2022. Combined with an unaccounted for number of 

blackhat hackers, employed on the opposite side of the firewall, these 

statistics demand a swift response.

Until recently, Eastern Europe, and Ukraine in particular, had been a safe 

haven for various controversial online operations. Boasting enormous 

numbers of highly qualified math and computer science university 

graduates, the country’s economy still has little to offer these people. 

Nevertheless, Ukrainian founders were behind such Silicon Valley 

unicorns as PayPal, WhatsApp and even the very WiFi technology you 

are likely using right now.

We think Ukraine can become the next European cybersecurity 

hub. Boosting expertise in this area is now a matter of the country’s 

survival, given Petya.A, the forced power grid blackout of 2015, and 

other state-sponsored cyber attacks sure to be inflicted. However, the 

emergence of this vibrant cybersecurity industry should be facilitated by 

a resourceful and ethical expert community.

Our goal at Hacken is to lay down such a framework by creating a 

stable means of income and financial incentives for its members. In the 

long run, your  participation in the Hacken Ecosystem will make sure the 

next generation of local computer whiz kids will be on your side of the 

firewall.

HKN

Our ecosystem consists of a token — the Hacken, and a constellation 

of businesses providing services, which can be received only by using 

Hacken as a payment instrument. The amount of Hackens is finite, 

limited to 20 million tokens that will be distributed during the pre-sale 

and the main token sale.

The businesses comprising the Hacken Ecosystem are the HackenProof 

bug bounty marketplace, Unreported Zero-Day Remuneration Platform, 

Hacken Cybersecurity Startups Incubator, Cybersecurity Analytics 

Center and HackIT Conference. Each element of this ecosystem is 

further described in a separate section of this paper.

The big idea behind Hacken is that it turns each owner of Hackens 

into a community member. Because Hacken is a specialized software 

utility token, being primarily focused on cybersecurity professionals and 

projects, it will also bring these people together by providing incentives 

for doing business with one another and for investment in cybersecurity 

startups. These people will need to communicate and interact with 

each other in order to make use of their Hackens. The more vibrant the 

community is, the more value it delivers to each member.

While our ecosystem has solid business plan and product roadmap, it is 

not only about business. Our aim is also to grow and support HackIT — 

the largest international cybersecurity conference in Ukraine.

The cybersecurity business is very much about expertise, ethics and 

persistent training. By supporting HackIT, we want to ensure that we 

give back to the community which empowers our platform.

A great illustration of our core values is the story of Oleksii Matiiasevych 

— Ukrainian cybersecurity professional, EDCC architect at Ambisafe and 

our technology advisor in this token sale.

Only this last Summer, on July 19, 2017, Oleksii discovered a critical 

vulnerability in the code of the Parity Ethereum wallet. There was no 

time for discussion, as Oleksii showed evidence of an ongoing hacker 

attack that resulted in the compromise of hundreds of Ethereum wallets. 

He ended up transferring $1,402,996.09 worth of Ethers from the 

compromised wallets to the ones he secured and controlled. Oleksii 

then contacted the White Hat Group which took charge of locating and 

returning all the coins to their rightful owners.

The ultimate goal of our ecosystem, is to create a generation of hackers 

to whom what Oleksii did is entirely normal, the only acceptable life 

scenario.

When clients sign the bug bounty program agreement, our team 

creates a relevant blockchain block containing data about the product, 

the terms of service agreement and a timestamp. The next block of 

the chain, which is specific to this client, will contain information on 

vulnerabilities, discovered during our security research. 

After clients resolve the vulnerabilities that were discovered during the 

bug bounty research, HackenProof experts conduct a post-research 

audit. We then discuss our findings with the clients and advise any 

additional measures which need to be taken. Should the findings of the 

audit be satisfactory to both parties, our team and the clients, we form 

the next block in the chain, which contains information about the issues 

that were resolved.

At the end, clients receive a HackenProof Vulnerabilities and 

Countermeasures Certificate, containing a report on all the 

vulnerabilities discovered and resolved with a

timestamp for each event. Clients can then adjust their Blockchain 

sharing preferences and publish the certificate to the public, customers, 

investors or to whomever they designate.

Use of Blockchain?

Besides use of the blockchain in cybersecurity, this token sale 

also features an interesting financial innovation in the area of 

cryptocurrencies. That is our “burning” principle, which we explain in a 

separate section of this paper.

As you can see from our brief market analysis in the Addendum to this 

paper, or from your own personal observations, there are already at 

least four existing bug bounty and penetration testing services. Each of 

these has a growing customer base and investor support ranging from 

several to 74M US dollars. So the obvious question is: does the market 

really need yet another one?

Why Yet Another 
Cybersecurity Marketplace?

We think it does.
Here are the reasons why:

Currently the supply fails to meet the demand in the area of penetration 

testing and bug bounty programs.

Recently Mazda sponsored a CTF contest in Las Vegas, in which the 

winner received a truck. After Jeep, Tesla and Nissan LEAF hacks, the 

automotive industry is desperate for highly qualified bounty hunters and 

penetration testers. In our situation, that translates to: no, four existing 

services are painfully not enough. There is still a blue ocean of niche 

and general purpose cybersecurity communities.

A cybersecurity ecosystem that is custom-tailored for blockchain. Being 

blockchain entrepreneurs ourselves, we understand this technology, 

its nuances, risks and its community better than most of the current 

cybersecurity establishment. Reading about blockchain in the Wall 

Street Journal, discussing it with colleagues over a cup of coffee and 

investing a few thousand dollars in Bitcoin just for fun, is one thing. 

Basing your entire business cash flow and core certification technology 

on blockchain is something entirely different.

2 /

Did we forget the SME? Small and medium enterprises cannot afford the 

benefits of the enterprise penetration testing and bug bounty programs. 

This does not mean they don’t need one. In the current cybersecurity 

environment, being a small business means very limited access to 

the perks of modern computer security infrastructure. We will provide 

SMEs with simple and convenient online tools to organize and run bug 

bounty and penetration testing campaigns.

3 /

Same time zone, same cultural values. Hacken will be among the first 

movers in the European market of bug bounty marketplaces. Currently 

this market is dominated by Silicon Valley based providers. This is 

perfectly understandable, but San Francisco and Bay Area are not the 

only place in the World where good software and hardware projects are 

created. There is still enough demand for services based in other parts 

of the World and providing good value for the money.

For millennia immeasurable, money had been an efficient, yet not the 

main driver, in uniting human organizations and driving their subsequent 

growth and development. Hacken is no exception. The distributed 

nature of blockchain enables us to promptly create a new token and 

imbue it with the best qualities of a modern currency. The smart 

contracts technology enables us to add an additional layer to Hacken 

and create economic incentives for the cybersecurity community to 

unite and cooperate in an ethical and legitimate manner.

Hacken is the only currency accepted inside our ecosystem. Any 

new orders via HackenProof, Unreported Zero-Day Remuneration 

Platform, Cybersecurity Analytics Center or new investments via Hacken 

Accelerator must be made in Hackens. This will reward community 

members who get paid in Hackens, by providing positive liquidity and 

low volatility.

Please note: Hackens are not intended to be a digital currency, 

commodity or any other kind of financial instrument, do not represent 

any share, stake or security or equivalent rights, including, but not 

limited to, any right to receive future revenue shares and intellectual 

property rights, and do not represent any ownership right.

We invented the “burning” principle for this token sale for regulatory 

reasons that might otherwise prevent customers residing in some 

jurisdictions from participating. We also believe that “burning” will 

expedite the growth of liquidity, and lessen the volatility risks for Hacken. 

It is important for all owners of Hacken to understand that “burning” 

affects only the platform fees, thus reducing the amount of Hackens 

which we, the founders of the platform, not our customers or clients, 

own.

What happens to the other 50% of our service margin that is not 

burned? The managing company of the Hacken Ecosystem will 

accumulate these Hackens until their amount reaches 1% of the total 

amount of Hackens in circulation. 

Upon this event we will make 24 hours announcement, and then sell 

1% of the amount accumulated at the moment of the event (i.e. 0.01% 

of the total amount of Hackens as of the moment of the event) via the 

major cryptocurrency exchanges. The sale will take place at

14:00 EET on the day following the day of the announcement. The list 

of exchanges will be provided to the public at the time of occurrence of 

the first such sale. We reserve the right to amend the list of exchanges in 

the future.

The “burning” will change the settled exchange rate of Hackens v. other 

crypto or fiat currencies. We need this to keep a decent price tag for 

vulnerability search services, attract more hackers to the platform, as 

well as ensure the stable and efficient maintenance of our Ecosystem. 

All the burning data will be transparent and available to the public via our

website.

The escrow agents are involved in the process of guarding and 

managing the assets of investors. Their function is to monitor the use of 

the collected funds according to the roadmap described in this paper. 

The escrow agents can veto the transaction by applying

a cryptographic key to the project’s HKN wallet, which we use to 

accumulate funds from investors.

Escrow and Audit

Disclaimers

The escrow account providers will be Juscutum and one of the Big 4 

audit companies selected via tender managed by the Public Board of 

Trustees of the Hacken Ecosystem. Juscutum is a Ukrainian law firm 

based in Kyiv and providing legal support for blockchain businesses. For 

the HackenProof and HackIT Conference, 70% of the raised funds will 

be kept at Escrow. An escrow account will be established for 100% of 

the budgeted R&D costs for the Zero-day Platform, Hacken Accelerator 

and Cybersecurity Analytics Center.

The yearly audit of the financial statements of the legal entities 

comprising the Hacken Ecosystem will be conducted by an 

internationally recognized audit organisation, selected via tender 

managed by the Public Board of Trustees of the Hacken Ecosystem.

HackenProof

HackenProof is a bug bounty marketplace platform created by white 

hat hackers and the blockchain community based on the principle of fair 

share. This is a place where the two communities can cooperate and 

support each other. The purposes of this cooperation are high quality 

penetration testing and vulnerability reports for a premium fee paid to 

community members submitting these reports.

How Does It Work?
Customers sign up for the bounty hunting program, choose a defined 

program policy, decide on invitations and rewards and set the level of 

bounty payment.

Our experts help customers setup and customise their program, and 

manage it if need be.

After the scope of the security assessment is established our team 

invites the Hacken community to participate in the assessment. 

Hundreds of white hats evaluate the customer’s code for vulnerabilities 

and bugs.

The customer gets a Vulnerabilities Certificate, attesting that her 

software was examined and tested by the Hacken community. 

Optionally, there can be a separate Countermeasures section in the 

Certificate, listing all the issues discovered and patched by the client.

Key Features

Invite only or public — the public visibility level of your bug bounty 

program can be configured depending on your objectives.

Self managed or dedicated — your program can be customised 

depending on your budget and level of expertise.

Customer self-service portal with rich scope of flexibility. You can 

run a wizard to define and start your program, a bot will then check the 

reports and eliminate duplicates. You can then adjust the payments to 

offer bonuses for the most valuable discoveries.

Customizable and sealed testing environment empowered by 

VDI, VPN and PAM solutions, allowing researchers participating in 

the campaign to better understand the client’s infrastructure without 

causing any harm or drama.

Money Back Guarantee

Some time after the initial launch we will implement the money back 

guarantee. For an additional fee the client will be able to purchase our 

services with a ‘money back’ option.

Therefore, if a client discovers a major vulnerability, which was 

not covered by HackenProof Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures 

Certificate after this certificate was issued, then client can claim back 

the fee paid to us. The expert examination of whether the discovered 

vulnerability exists and whether this is a ‘major’ vulnerability will be 

conducted by a third party, predetermined by the contract between the 

client and HackenProof.

original and previously undisclosed zero-day research.

We understand the legal and ethical risks involved, but our vision is that 

zero-day discoveries must have a transparent and publicly accountable 

remuneration channel, otherwise they will end up in the wrong hands. 

Currently the major risk is that many elements of the self-initiated zero-

day research methodology are considered illegal in many jurisdictions. 

Such regulatory attitude slows down the development of verified 

remuneration channels and of zero-day research itself.

Regulatory inconsistencies lead to the risks of criminal prosecution 

of white hat experts openly doing their research for the benefit of 

humanity, while black hat hackers usually escape any punishment, 

doing dirty work for illegal cartels or rogue state actors. The reason 

for this, is a lack of effective digital discovery and evidence gathering 

mechanisms by local law enforcement agencies or, in the case of illegal 

state-sponsored hacking, direct government support and financing of 

the black hat hacking operations.

We will establish ethical and anonymous business processes for 

talented individuals researching zero-day vulnerabilities. The plan is to

invest a substantial amount of funds raised during this token sale in the 

research of regulatory and legislative framework in major jurisdictions, 

in particular — Europe. The ultimate goal is to create a transparent 

regulatory environment for our fund before it starts operations.

We would like to run special discounts for our community members to 

become subscribers of our Zero-Day Platform. However, it is important 

for Hacken community members to understand that for ethical and 

regulatory reasons, their participation in this token sale does not 

automatically grant them access to the Zero-Day Platform.

The public Board of Trustees of the Zero-Day Remuneration Platform 

will draft the access rules and perform the screening process. This 

Board will be created within one year after the token sale, if we reach 

the milestone which enables the Zero-Day Remuneration Platform. See 

the Hacken Token section for more details. The Board will consist of the 

most respected and experienced members of our community.

It is great when your employees decide to start their own business.

That is an indicator that their current employment is enriching, inspiring 

and empowering.

 In the 2000s Google started incentivising employees to ‘moonlight’ 

and develop their own projects and products. More recently it resulted 

in the emergence of Google Ventures, one of the most respected and 

innovative venture capital funds worldwide.

Being business owners in the cybersecurity field ourselves, we see the 

huge openness and potential of the Eastern European cybersecurity 

market. Frankly, it needs more high quality players and more innovative 

business models.

The biggest current problem is a lack of skills in attracting reliable 

investors and building a transparent corporate structure among Eastern 

Europeans who decide to start their own cybersecurity businesses. This 

results in a limited amount of substantial deals in our part of the world. 

Without big exists, there are less angels ready to support early stage 

startups. Consecutively, the early mistakes and resulting failures 

traumatise young founders, driving them away from the very idea of 

launching their own business. We believe Hacken can break this vicious 

circle, by building a solid reputation among investors and business 

owners and then vouching for the best and most reliable members of 

our community. We will by then know whom they are, not only from 

their pitch decks and Linkedin profiles, but from their real life projects and 

the everyday stress of deadlines and business KPIs.



21

After selecting these soon-to-be entrepreneurs, we will beef up their 

knowledge. By inviting our best clients and community members who 

already run their own businesses, they will be inspired and grow the 

next generation of cybersecurity leaders.

Hackit is an annual international forum on cybersecurity held in Kharkiv, 

Ukraine.

The first HackIT Conference gathered 450 participants from two 

countries, the second had 650 participants from six countries. Besides 

the traditional speaking panels featuring local and international experts, 

HackIT runs a number of specialized cybersecurity competitions, which 

are free for everyone to participate.

HackIT CTF will take place on August 25 —27 of this year. Hackers 

will compete in 8 categories: Web, Misc, Joy, Crypto, PWN, Reverse, 

Forensics, Stego. In 2016, the event gathered more than 5,000 unique 

online participants from 1062 teams coming from 93 countries. The 

winner of the event, the DCUA team from Ukraine later became the best 

team of 2016 Worldwide according the CTF Time Rating.

The selection round for this competition occurs in the first half of 

the conference day and the final takes place during its second half. 

During the selection round, each participant has 30 minutes to solve 

the maximum number of cybersecurity assignments and earn points. 

Finalists who earned the maximum points then take the podium to 

perform real time cybersecurity problem solving. Their computer 

screens are broadcasted to the audience, and their performance is 

covered live by a cybersports TV anchor.

Why Does It 
Matter?

te
r?

It is not news that cybersecurity is currently hot and so are cryptocurrencies. 

Nor is it anymore surprising to the World that Eastern Europe had 

currently become a testing range for state-sponsored cyber warfare.

Currently Ukraine is a notorious illustration of how traditional institutions 

failed to protect those for which they were created. The partial excuse 

here is our unreformed post-Soviet mentality, which was not ready for 

exponential digital threats of a World that is flat.

At the same time, during these recent turbulent years we observed 

a phenomenon that is totally new to our part of the World — a civic 

cyberactivism. Ordinary people: university professors, business 

consultants, attorneys and bankers united their efforts to build the 

country’s collective cyberdefence system. We already saw this three 

years ago in the wake of Ukraine’s military conflict that happened in the 

real space. 

Such grassroots activism not only provides hope, but can also lead to 

a number of successful business cases. After all, the Western firewalls 

failed as well in 2015-2017, despite having better institutional culture, 

a well-established system of training, and most importantly, larger 

defense budgets which cannot be compared to the ones of Eastern 

Europe.

Cryptocurrencies play a vital role in enabling huge, distributed and 

transparent cyberdefense budgets formed by individual backers. They 

allow for bypassing the traditional institutional network, which in this 

case, might reach the target only when it is already too late.

This token sale, if successful, will enable us not only to build a sound 

regional cyberdefense system, but one which will also adjust itself to the 

challenges that will undoubtedly appear within the next decade. It might 

also launch a movement, that in several years will become an important 

factor in deterring and countering international cybercrime, including 

the ones that are state-sponsored.

Our experiment at Hacken starts with the obvious business model: a 

bug bounty and crowdsourced penetration testing platform. While 

some similar platforms already exist, we believe there is still a lot of land 

under the sun, as we explained in a separate section of this paper. 

We then plan to unfold the ecosystem into two of our most risky 

adventures: the Zero-day Fund for buying critical vulnerabilities out 

of the grey market and the Accelerator for cybersecurity startups. Yes, 

currently there are too many startups with the word ‘cyber’ in their pitch 

deck. In this case, think not of a business opportunist, but of a local self-

educated engineer with limited command of English (as of now), yet 

with a head full of bright ideas which might bring about the next WiFi 

or PayPal. We know such people exist in our neck of woods. We know 

mentors, who will help them to ramp their ideas up to a commercial 

level.

The Zero-day Fund might not initially seem related to the Accelerator, 

but it most definitely is. In order to drive smart Eastern Europeans 

away from dubious sources of income, we will first offer to legitimize 

their work by acquiring vulnerabilities they discover and making sure 

such vulnerabilities are disclosed to the rightful parties, primarily — the 

vendors. We will then offer a viable alternative to hacking, which in 

time will certainly become increasingly mundane. The alternative we 

are promoting is launching a legitimate business and halting being 

dependant on the Don who pays for petty dirty jobs.

Finally, while taking the best talent from the existing ecosystem, we 

want to make sure to give back. This effort is our support of HackIT 

Conference and creation of Cybersecurity Analytics Center.

HackIT already serves as a storefront for the profession. It is an 

inspiration for future generations and a place of knowledge exchange 

between established and aspiring cybersecurity professionals. The 

Center will then employ and support those people, who don’t feel like 

starting their own business and are more inclined towards an academic 

and research career, moving forward the fundamental science of 

cybersecurity.

There are more projects to come, and they are already in our roadmap 

and on our radar. However, we realise that the existing milestones are 

already very ambitious and will require our full commitment at least for 

several years. So we better do what must be done first, and then “we will 

live on and we will see”, as the common Ukrainian expression goes.

We hope this paper provided solid arguments and detailed information 

and ultimately convinced you to participate in our Hacken sale. If so, 

welcome to the Hacken Ecosystem and we’ll see you soon as our 

respected community member and client. If not, we will be happy to 

provide you with additional assistance and more details at info@hacken.
