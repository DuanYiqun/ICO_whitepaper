1.   INTRODUCTION

1.1.	 VISION: NEXT GENERATION, BLOCKCHAIN

Futurist Alvin Toffler proposed sea changes in society based around adaption of new 
technologies. The 1st wave is the agricultural revolution; the 2nd wave is the industrial 
revolution; and the 3rd wave is the information revolution.  We are currently seeing the 
culmination of the 3rd wave, perhaps even a 4th wave, as distributed networks fundamentally 
alter the way people earn a living, learn about the world, and form social bonds. 

One of these distributed networks reshaping the world of finance and financial technology 
fields is the ‘Blockchain’. Blockchain technology is the underpinning of ‘Bitcoin’, a crypto-
currency developed by unknown programmer Satoshi Nakamoto. The revolutionary feature 
of crypto-currencies is that they are not controlled by any governments or centralizing 
organizations.

The crypto-currency is decentralized currency; therefore, the radical problem of fiat-currency 
which centralized by the government has been removed.

Before the epidemic of ‘Bitcoin Fever’, related technology developers attempted to build 
and to commercialize crypto-currencies, but commercializing the crypto-currency was 
unsuccessful. To be acknowledged as a currency, the developed currency must be used by 
a vast number of people, but crypto-currency could not obtain enough attention from the 
public. Meanwhile the fiat-currency values have faltered by the sequence of adverse events. 
The public shifted their interest toward the ‘decentralized currency’. Bitcoin distinguishes from 
the fiat currency with three features: decentralized currency, high transparency, and safe from 
hacking.

The implementation of the blockchain in Bitcoin achieved decentralization with safety 
and transparency. The rapid adoption of Bitcoin, even to the point of a  ‘Bitcoin fever’,  has 
shown the global appetite for a decentralized currency, and the new launched ICOs show the 
robustness of both the business models and technologies in a blockchain. 

Since the first blockchain is created by Satoshi Nakamoto in August of 2014, Bitcoin creates a 
new block every ten minutes. The blockchain has distinguishing features such as P2P (peer-to-
peer) network, consensus algorithm, hash function, etc. At its heart the blockchain is a ledger 
kept up-to-date by the community who use it. Every time new transactions are recorded 
they are appended to the end of the blockchain, and the ledger continues to grow. Through 
these features the blockchain technology has been acknowledged to be the most innovative 
technology which will lead us to another stage of future technology.

The decentralized ledger structure of the blockchain: 1) is safe from counterfeiting; 2) is

transparent, since transaction time cannot be manipulated; 3) requires no third party to 
manage; 4) drastically decreased the transaction fee since no third-party is involved; 5) is not 
limited geographically; and 6) is scalable. These features are necessary for a successful crypto-
currency, and it is only with their implementation in the blockchain were These features 
integrated into single currency. 

Recently, a variety of ICO  projects have been launched based on the blockchain technology 
to achieve an idealistic network ecosystem. . Expansion of innovative ICO projects will lead us 
to another level of revolution comparing to revolutions mentioned earlier. The blockchain, 
crypto-currency, and ICOs will change our daily life. 

Each new ICO is attempting to create a decentralized ecosystem that implements the promise 
of crypto-currencies, but the thousands of ICOs fragmenting the marketplace ironically 
undermine that. Linker Project solves this ironic problem of ICOs. Every race and generation 
can see the promise of a safe stable currency unfettered by the constraints of a centralized 
authority.

1.2.	 BACKGROUND 

1.2.1. RISE OF CRYPTO-CURRENCY

There are three key characteristics which distinguishes a crypto currency from the existing fiat 
currencies such as dollars, euros, won, etc.

First, there is no central authority managing the currency. Existing fiat-currencies are mostly 
managed by governments, or governmental organizations, through the delegated authority of 
a central bank. If the government fails as a manager the currency can destabilize to devastating 
effect as seen in Weimer Germany, Zimbabwe in the 200s, or Venezuela currently.  Since 
crypto currencies are managed by their users, no single government misstep can destabilize 
the currency. 

Second, crypto-currencies are highly transparent, creating trust. Many mistakenly believe that 
the anonymity in crypto-currencies prevents transparency of transactions, but all the ledgers 
are opened to all users since all the ledgers are stored by every user. There is a degree of 
anonymity in that transaction records are connected to a currency address, not a personal 
profile, which can allow criminal uses, as seen with Bitcoin. However well-run exchanges can 
discourage criminal activity.  Furthermore, most countries require KYC protocol  to verify the 
users’ identity during a withdrawal from an exchange.

Third, crypto-currency is safe from the hackers’ attack. Crypto-currency is built on the 
blockchain; therefore, hacker’s manipulation of crypto-currency is realistically impossible. 
Since all the ledgers are processed under the proving procedure of all the users on the 
network, the hacker needs the super computer which can calculate faster than the sum of all 
the user’s computers. In the past, the press announced that the crypto-currency exchange was 
hacked, but this event occurred not by the breach of crypto-currency, but by the breach of the 
exchange. Since the genesis block of crypto-currency was issued, crypto-currency built on the 
blockchain has not fallen by the attack of the hackers.

1.2.2. COMPONENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN

Every block is composed of <block number>, <previous hash number>, <Nonce>, <List of 
Transactions> ,and different hash numbers are assigned to each block.

TRANSACTION
Using Bitcoin as an example, the encrypted information of transferring a Bitcoin is recorded is 
called a transaction. A transaction only includes the ‘sender’s address’, the ‘receiver’s address’, 
and the ‘amount transferred’; therefore, the anonymity is assured. All transactions occurring 
during a ten minute period are recorded together in a ‘block’.

HASH
In the virtual platform, ‘block address’ functions as chain. Each block contains a unique 
address; and the most recently issued block contains the address information of previous 
block. Therefore, the user can track the transaction all the way to the first block (genesis 
block). Official terminology of ‘address’ is ‘Hash’, and hash takes one of the most important 
roles in the blockchain technology. 

Hash is a string of random characters with a given length. This string of characters changes 
into totally different hash if a single character in the block is changed by the external factor. 
Number of hash character is defined by the size of hash: the size of bit. Two hash digits can 
be expressed with one bit. So on, ten bits produce ten to the two digits of hash; which means 
1024 different hash can be produced, and with ten bits, 1025th data can be cashed.

Bitcoin uses hash function called SHA-256 which bit size is 256bits; which means 10^77 
different hash can be produced. Since 10^77 is an astronomical figure, collision of hash can 
barely occur.

Hash is also called ‘digital fingerprint’. Different fingerprints commonly mean different people. 
In fact, hash is used as fingerprint in the blockchain system since hash changes into totally 
different hash if a single character in the block changes. As result, if malicious user attempts 
to manipulate transactions in the block, other users can identify that immediately; therefore, 
hash is a key of Bitcoin security system.

NONCE
As gold is pulled from the earth by the miners, Bitcoin contains is pulled from the 
computational ether in an analogues manner. Bitcoin mining is a data computing competition 
of the participants; the answer in this competition is called ‘Nonce’.

The problem given for bitcoin mining is closely related to the hash. For example, the problem 
asks to find the nonce which makes first four digits of the hash into ‘0000’. As mentioned 
earlier, each block is composed of nonce, list of transaction, and previous hash, and change of 
a single character produces totally different hash. 

Therefore, bitcoin miners must enter all the possible values to find the nonce which produces 
given the hash condition. This process takes ten minutes, and as number of nodes increases 
the system designs the mining problem becomes more complicated.

1.2.3. PRINCIPLE OF BITCOIN FUNCTION

CREATING BLOCK
As mentioned earlier, the blockchain is a decentralized network connecting worldwide. As a 
new miner installs the Bitcoin program, all the blockchain information copied to the user’s 
computer; which means that each user has identical blockchain. 

After ten minutes, each miner’s computer executes the task to find the correct nonce to the 
new hash number formed by transactions occurred in ten minutes. The first successful miner 
announces the result on the network; this process is called ‘Broadcasting’. After confirmation 
of results from the most miners, a new block connects to the blockchain, and the first 
successful miner receives a certain amount of Bitcoin as a reward.

REWARD SYSTEM
Reward system of Bitcoin is called PoW (Proof of Work). Consensus protocol bases on the 
amount of calculation. The first successful miner obtains the right to issue the block and 
receive a certain amount of bitcoin as reward.

Even though the centralizing organization does not exist, users participate to mining because of 
the Bitcoin reward. Furthermore, mining itself is done by complicated computational problem, 
and block is issued after the proof of the most miners; therefore, changing information within 
the block is barely possible.

The other reward system proposed is PoS (Proof of Stake). This reward system provides priority 
of mining to the user who possesses the largest volume of Bitcoin. PoS can be successful 
under a conjecture: the users who possess the large volume of Bitcoin are not willing the value 
of Bitcoin faltered. Complexity of the computational problem depreciates as a miner’s volume 
of Bitcoin possession increases.

ATTEMPT OF CHANGING BLOCK INFORMATION

Comprehending the result of changing block information helps to understand how the 
blockchain maximizes the security level of Bitcoin.

As mentioned earlier, even a single character in the block change results to totally different 
hash code. For example, the malicious user attempts to change the information in the 10th 
block; 10th block’s hash code changes; and the user must find nonce which matches with the 
altered hash. Even though the correct nonce is found, 10th block hash registered in 11th block 
does not match; therefore, the malicious user must find the nonce for the 11th block, too. 
Since number of block extends every ten minutes, finding all the nonce which fits to the new 
hash ahead of all the miners around world is barely possible. (If two blocks are produced at 
the same time, short chain will be discarded.)

1.3.	 RECENT LEGAL ISSUES

1.3.1. REPUBLIC OF KOREA

In the Republic of Korea, trading volume of Bitcoin has drastically increased. Meanwhile 
trading volume of Bitcoin overtook the trading volume of KOSDAQ (Korean Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation). In August 19th, crypto-currency exchange, Bithumb announced that 
one-day trading volume reached approximately 2.6 trillion KRW which is larger than KOSDAQ 
trading volume of 2.4 trillion KRW (August 18th).
 
Number of issued crypto-currencies is more than 1,100 worldwide, and 108 out of 1,100 
coins are tradeable in the exchange; and the total market value had exceeded 170 billion USD 
(approx. 190 trillion KRW).

Crypto-currencies are not considered legal tender by the government, and crypto-currency 
balances in account are not protected by the KDIC (Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation); 
further crypto-currencies are not even classified as electronic prepayment means.

According to the governmental announcement in August 1st, congressman Yong-Jin Park plans 
to propose the bill <Amendment of Law on Electronic Financial Transaction to Protect Crypto-
currency Users> which will create a crypto-currency trader approval system to prevent the 
illegal methods of crypto-currency trading. Capital gain tax is not applied to crypto-currency 
like gold or stocks.

On September 3rd, the government proposed a real name authentication for trading crypto-
currency. Going through a bank, a prospective trader in crypto-currencies must provide their 
real name to create an account. In fact, the trader must have a virtual account connected to 
the user’s bank account. This amendment will be effective in December, and if the crypto-
currency exchange does not submit the users’ information for the real name authentication, 
connected bank immediately stops the virtual account trading.

1.3.2. CHINA

Since 23% of crypto-currency trading volume is in China, its policies have a huge effect 
globally. 

On August 30th, Chinese government announced that ICOs will be prohibited until the 
regulation to protect investor is established; Chinese government prohibited ICOs on 
September 4th.  

On September 15, Chinese crypto-currency exchange, BTC China was closed by the 
government, the first such closure in China. According the BTC China representative, “This act 
is reflection of the ICO prohibition to prevent investment risks, but OTC is still open.”

1.3.3. JAPAN

In 2017 the Japanese government has passed laws: accepting crypto-currencies as legal tender 
and exempting crypto-currency purchases from consumption taxes. The National Tax Services 
is reviewing taxes on profits from crypto-currency trading, with results expected in March of 
2018. 

1.3.4. RUSSIA

On September 9, 2017 the Russian Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov stated that he is willing 
to restrict the supply of crypto-currencies. While he stated that there is no reason to prohibit 
crypto-currencies, the government regulation must be reviewed. Finalized regulations are 
expected near the end of 2017. It is expected that the government will model crypto-currency 
regulations after current bond market regulations.

1.3.5. UNITED STATES

In July 2017, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned about investing in crypto-
currency. On August 28th, SEC also stated not to invest in a company aiming to raise fund by 
selling crypto-currencies.

1.3.6. MARKET ANALYSIS

The Russian government’s position mirrors that of the broader crypto currency markets 
where increased regulations are expected as a trade of for acceptance by authorities.  While 
regulations are somewhat inimical to the spirit of crypto-currencies and their decentralized 
structure, they can bring benefits, such as greater acceptance and a stronger legal framework.

2.   LINKER COIN

2.1.	 NETWORK OF NETWORKS

In the past, the invention of the internet drastically expanded our radius of action. Term 
‘Internet’ was invented in 1973 by the inventors of internet protocol TCP/IP (Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) fundamental concepts, Vinton Gray Cerf and Robert E. 
“Bob” Kahn. Vint and Bob aims the concept called ‘Network of Networks’ and tried to develop 
the ‘Inter Network’ which connects all the computers around the world. Later, the concept of 
‘Inter Network’ became an origin of ’Internet’.

As smartphone is distributed worldwide, the internet has become an essential in our life. 
Information was delivered through TV, radio, or newspaper, but now information flourishes 
through the internet and the smartphone. Mobile banking system is now more convenient 
than offline bank, and without ATM, money can be transferred through mobile banking. In 
fact, financial instruments can be purchased through the internet. As a result, number of 
offline store is rapidly decreasing.

The internet is now a part of our daily life, but the original purpose of the internet as a ‘ 
Network of Networks’ has to be reconsidered especially in regards to financial transactions. On 
the internet, the user can cross the border of countries, but their activities are restricted by the 
governmental organization. 

For example in South Korea, when the user signs in a certain commercial website, the real 
name authentication requires the resident registration number (the same with the social 
security number in the United States), and phone verification. Even though foreigner service 
for those who do not have the resident registration number exists, foreigner service itself is the 
proof of the separation and the restriction. 

Typically in the banking system, when a person wants to use a foreign banking system, the 
person should already have the account of the foreign banking, or need to request the Foreign 
Service at domestic bank; therefore, the internet expanded the radius of act, but was not able 
to establish ‘Network of Networks’.

Using the blockchain technology, various ICO projects aim for the decentralization of 
finance from the government and also aim the creation of an unconstrained network of 
networks. Current crypto-currencies, ongoing ICOs, or as yet unrealized projects will create 
a new ecosystem on the blockchain system. These proposals could create the world largest 
online casino, online job market, online game platform, healthcare platform, financial and 
industrial platform, etc. In short, their proposal is that they will create coins, which can be used 
worldwide in every existing on/offline service.

As attention toward the crypto-currency has drastically increased, the investment volume of 
ICO has already overtaken the investment volume of venture capital worldwide. This interests 
as spawned tens of thousands of different coins, but all these ICOs are hard to keep track of. 
The exponential increase in crypto-currencies threatens to separate this nascent network again 
into fractions: dividing the digital world into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoin, etc, just as the physical 
world is divided into countries.

In the midst this crisis of crypto-currencies, Linker Coin is launching. The ultimate vision of 
Linker Coin is to link the various disparate networks to achieve the true ‘Network of Network’. 
If the internet attempted to connect geographically separated countries, the Linker Coin links 
all the coin-centered networks into one unified ecosystem.

Linker Coin is a medium for trading crypto-currencies, which otherwise would not be 
exchangeable with other crypto-currencies and also with fiat-currencies. As a facilitator of 
inter-currency exchange, Linker Coin will act as a catalyst in the market. Linker Coin can act 
as a substitute coin within an ICO projects; meaning an investor in that ICO can participate via 
Linker Coin without being forced into a specific ICO project coin. 

Linker Coin also can be traded with the coins which are not built on ERC20 , and can be 
exchanged with fiat-currency through the crypto-currency exchange operating under the 
Linker Project. Rather than promoting the low commission from the exchange like other 
crypto-currency exchanges, Linker Project targets the liquidity provision of crypto-currencies. 
As Liquidity of crypto-currencies is assured, demand of Linker Coin will increase, Linker Coin 
value will be set by the supply and demand law.

Linker Coin’s essence differs from the other ICO projects, which propose complicated and 
incomprehensible future. Linker Coin develops based on the reality of crypto-currency market; 
and this project is to satisfy the investors’ needs. Therefore, Linker Project prepared a special 
ICO to allow objective evaluations from the users, and to adopt the evaluation.

2.2.	 ERC223 PROTOCOL

Linker Coin is design on the ERC20 and will be rebuilt on the ERC223, which is the enhanced 
version of the common ERC20 protocol. ERC223 revised several problems with ERC20. ERC223 
includes all the features of, and is fully backwards compatible with, ERC20. Four Revisions 
applied to ERC223

First, ERC223 Protocol Fixed the system error of losing the Ethereum token due to an address 
error. Second,  a receiver can block the transaction from the malicious senders such as hacker 
and terrorist, and obtain more control of Ethereum transactions. Third, in ERC201, token 
transaction is processed in 2-steps: this is reduced to a single step in ERC223 increasing speeds 
and lowering computational costs. The most important revision is that in ERC223 additional 
approval is not always required. This is important key feature to achieve lower computational 
cost in the decentralized exchange. The importance of escrow to the linker project is explored 
in Chapter 4.

3.   LINKER TO VARIOUS INDUSTRIES

Linker Coin will unify the Coins issued by other ICO Projects, using Linker Coin as a transaction 
medium. In this chapter, ICO projects in various industries will be discussed, and the benefits 
of connecting them to the Linker Project explored.

3.1.	 LINKER TO SOCIAL NETWORK

Social networks, like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, allow users to share their thoughts, 
knowledge, and information in real time. While social networks have expanded across the 
globe, existing social networks are vulnerable to security breaches. 

Indorse Pte. Ltd. has launched a blockchain based social network system, which improves 
security.  Indorse’s innovated social network protects users from hackers, and their voting 
system malicious users from the network. Their voting system is based around their IND  and 
SCR  coins.   

Coins issued by the Indorse can only be purchased in Ethereum, and cannot be traded freely. 
Their coins are restricted to the Indorse platform, limiting their utility, and value. IND1 and SCR2 
coins are based on ERC20 and thus are fully compatible with Linker Coins (LNC). LNC could be 
used as a medium of exchanging increasing liquidity in the Indorse network and connecting it 
to other coins.

3.2.	 LINKER TO HEALTHCARE

Healthcare systems are increasing being digitized to provide better access to patient data. 
However, this increased the threat of security breaches exposing this incredibly sensitive 
personal information. Just as in social networks, blockchains can improve the security of 
healthcare data systems.  Healthcare systems developer Bowhead Health has issued AHT coin 
with the goal of improving security of medical data systems via the blockchain. Of particular 
interest is the ‘Smart Contract’ feature of ERC20, which validates limited access of organization 
or individual to only the appropriate data.

AHT coin issued by Bowhead Health can only be purchased by Ethereum, but cannot be 
traded freely. To improve liquidity LNC can be traded for AHT coins, all the while maintaining 
the highest level of security of sensitive medical data.

3.3.	 LINKER TO eSPORTS

In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), eSports have developed as one of the most popular 
spectacles. In January 2017, the first augmented reality (AR) game “Pokemon Go” launched in 
South Korea. Reality Gaming Group Ltd issues RCCoin Gold and Silver, which can used in the 
game to make purchases. RCCoin are also based ERC20 protocol for the security and protection 
the player’s digital assets.

RCCoin are only available on Ethereum, and can only be traded on RGG’s exchanged.  By linking 
these gaming coins to LNC the value and stability of these coins can be secured.

3.4.	 LINKER TO ENTERTAINMENT

The global music industry as embraced digitization and is reached the total revenue of 
15.7 billion USD in 2017 Up to 50% of that revenue is expected to be from digital sales and 
subscriptions.

While digital music services have been a boon for music lovers, it can deprive artist of revenue, 
and deprive them of royalties due to copyright infringement.

Blockchain based digital music market Vibrate, based in Slovenia, uses its VIB Coin to protect 
the intellectual assets of the musicians and provide them with a revenue stream directly. VIB 
Coin can be used in various ways such as purchasing premium contents, buying event tickets 
etc.

The Linker project would allow music lovers to easily transfer other coins into VIB to get the 
latest song, or purchase tickets for the hottest concerts.

3.5.	 LINKER TO JOB MARKET 

People are increasingly participating in the gig economy, where they take short term 
employment for specific tasks, maximizing both their income and their work like balance. 
bitJob is ERC20 based job market platform run by smart contract. Employers and applicants 
are rated by each other and co-workers on the platform. Tokens are distributed for active 
participating in the market. 

Payments are processed with the escrow function of the smart contract. Employer set the 
settlement amount and conditions using tokens and via a contract with the applicant. , 

bitJob envisions a large business networking platform like LinkedIn, but with added 
transparency, security, and integrated payments all through its implementation the

blockchain. The largest risk of this project is that the supply and demand of both employers 
and applicants is mismatched. As the supply and demand mismatches, coins issued by bitJob 
may be constrained in the bitJob. Linker Project addresses this need by linking the job market 
platform like bitJob to the wider market. As a result, Linker Project creates the network which 
links to Job market network to provide more opportunities to both employers and applicants.

4.  LINKER COIN ARCHITECTURE

4.1.	 INTRODUCTION

Current networks for crypto-currency exchange are not flexible. Each coin issued through an 
ICO creates its own unique network. Social networks, healthcare service networks, payment 
networks, e-sports networks, and gambling all exist solid and isolated around their proprietary 
coin. While each of these coins can function well within its limited network, they lack the 
flexibility, liquidity, and the breath which comes from being convertible to each other (and to 
other coins).  It’s like a country whose national currency cannot be exchanged; that nation’s 
economy, citizens, and foreign visitors all suffer.

Linker Coin is like an exchange bureau allowing travelers and citizens alike to freely exchange 
currencies to suit their needs. Earnings from gambling networks can purchase game items; 
job seekers can provide references and referrals through their social networks, and healthcare 
networks can be underwritten by the latest hit single to top the charts. Linker Coin is designed 
as a medium of exchange connecting all these segregated virtual ecosystems into one true 
network of networks.

4.2.	 NETWORK OF NETWORKS

FIGURE 1) LINKER PROJECT OVERVIEW

Figure 1 shows a schematic of how Linker Coin will integrate these various virtual networks 
and the real world. Networks are linked to the Decentralized Exchange (also known as ‘Linker’). 
Each ‘Linker’ is then further connected to the real world through a Centralized Exchange. This 
means coins from disparate blockchain networks convertible to each other through Linker 
Coin and are then further convertible into fiat-currencies the Centralized Exchange.

Linker Coins are also convertible to Coins pegged to fiat-currency such as KRWp, USDp, EURp, 
and JPYp. The Linker Coin Foundation endeavors to keep the value of Pegged Coin matched to 
their respective fiat currency. Value of Pegged Coin will be promising if Pegged Coin are owned 
and managed by the Linker Coin Foundation or partner corporate to maintain the asking 
price; KRWp will maintain a similar value with KRW. Pegged Coins can be also be used in the 
E-commerce platform directly as their value is fixed to fiat-currencies.

4.3.	 LINKER TO CRYPTO-CURRENCY NETWORK

Each individual Linker will connect to a specific network and collectively they make up the 
Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

We will create 6 individual Linker varieties depending on the network to which they connect. 
We will develop these sequentially as funds become available during the ICO: Ethereum Linker 
to Ethereum, ERC Linker to ERC20, Peg Linker to Pegged Coins, Semi-Decen Linker to Bitcoin, 
Semi-Decen_R Linkerfrom Bitcoin to real world financial institutions, Ethereum_R Linker from 
Ethereum to real world institutions, and finally Linker X to other coin projects and to real world 

4.3.1. ETHEREUM LINKER

FIGURE 2) ETHEREUM LINKER

Ethereum Linker is an exchange system between Linker Coin and Ethereum. Linker Coin 
is designed on a smart contract validating the exchange with Ethereum. Furthermore, this 
system is a decentralized exchange built on ERC20 unlike current crypto-currency exchanges 
which are centralized exchange. A Decentralized Exchange rectifies many of the failings of 
existing centralized coin exchanges such as security breach, hacking, server manipulation, and 
even compensation of questionable legality.

4.3.2. DECENTRALIZED LINKER

FIGURE 3) DECENTRALIZED LINKER 1

Decentralized Linker  is the system which exchanges most ERC20 based tokens to Linker 
Coin. While many ERC20 based tokens have been issued through various ICO, most of these 
tokens are not listed on the broader crypto-currency exchange, which means investor’s funds 
are fixed. The investors should wait  until their tokens to be listed, though this is rarely the 
case. Even very successful tokens may not be listed, due to national regulations, technical 
difficulties, or management concerns. With the Decentralized Linker these coins can be 
converted into Linker Coin, and then further exchanged into other coin or fiat-currency.

The Linker system, which is built on ERC20, includes an ‘Escrow’ feature; it is this feature that 
enables ERC Linker  to exchange tokens issued with the ERC20 protocol into Linker Coin.
For example, an investor participates in an ICO project issuing an ERC20 token, we’ll call Token 
A. Now, the investor can neither exit the project nor withdraw Token A. That investor would 
have to wait until the platform decides to list Token A on an exchange. This is entirely left to 
the whims of the project manager subject to restrictions of the national government where the 
project is based. With the implementation of Linker Coin that investor can choose an amount 
of Token A, and send a request via the Linker system using Escrow feature. If another investor 
wants to purchase Token A, and their price and conditions match the Decentralized Linker will 
execute the exchange converting Linker Coin to Token A, within its matching engine

Unlike Centralized Exchange system which required lodging all the coins in the exchange 
to participate in a trade, the Escrow feature only requires lodging the amount that the user 
wants to exchange, and after a certain time (e.g. 50 blocks = 10minutes with Ethereum), the 
deposit is refunded back to the users if a match is not found; minimizing risk. In fact, every 
step is automatically processed by the smart contract; therefore, the additional risks in existing 
Centralized Exchanges such as credibility, bankruptcy, and external interference are minimized.

FIGURE 4) DECENTRALIZED LINKER 2

The matching engine running the linker system removes the time-delay problem of PoW1  
and PoS2 methods. Since the exchange does not interface with the buyer and seller during a 
matching transaction the anonymity of the users can be guaranteed, and the trading is not 
restricted by any certain country’s crypto-currency regulation 

The system charges a processing fee to ‘Taker’ and rewards a Linker Coin to the ‘Seller’ or 
‘Maker’. In this way the Linker system motivates users to participate in Linker Coin Network 
creating liquidity. Linker Coin Network participants are categorized into three types: 
Speculator, Arbitrager, and Liquidity Provider. 

Speculator is the investor holding coins from the other networks; Speculators are exchanging 
coins to Linker Coin to exit those networks. Arbitragers are those who are trading between 
coins on the Linker system, endeavoring to make a profit. Arbitrager compares the conversion 
price indices and their appetite for risk. The Liquidity Provider takes the role of Maker during 
the process of exchanging other coins into Linker Coin to take advantage of the reward system. 

These three types of users participate in the Linker system to achieve their purpose; through 
the course of a day a single user can act as all three according to their needs.  The multiple 
roles a user can inhabit further strength the Linker Coin Network. A certain percentage of 
transaction fees will be reverted to the Linker Coin Foundation. Currently, more than one 
thousand coins are issued in the blockchain network. Linker Coin will satisfy the needs of the 
investors who are willing to ‘Exit’ the network even before the supply and demand meet the 
equilibrium. During this process, demand of Linker Coin, a medium of trading, will rise.

4.3.3. SEMI-DECENTRALIZED LINKER

FIGURE 5) SEMI-DECENTRALIZED LINKER

Semi-Decentralized Linker connects to coins, like Bitcoin and Litecoin, which do not allow 
smart contracts. The Linker Matching Machine built on smart contract with an escrow feature 
and will still connect Bitcoin and Litecoin through a Semi-Decentralized system which is a joint 
exchange composed of centralized crypto-currency exchange and the escrow is built into the 
Linker project.

An investor who wants to exchange Bitcoin into Linker Coin lodges a Bitcoin to the centralized 
crypto-currency exchange. On the other side, an investor who wants to exchange Linker Coin 
into Bitcoin, lodges those Linker Coins Escrow. The Matching Engine finds the Linker Coin in 
the Escrow and if the price and conditions match the engine will deliver the Escrowed Linker 
Coins to the initial Bitcoin owner, and return the lodge Bitcoin the original Linker Coin owner.  
For the safely lodged Bitcoins need to be withdrawn from the Centralized Exchange upon 
completion of the transaction.

Compared to the Decentralized Linker explained in 4.3.2, the investor is still exposed to the 
Exchange Risk since one side of the transaction is still in the Centralized System. Also, the 
investors are exposed to operation risk due to human error as the semi Semi-Decentralized 
Linker is not fully executed by the smart contract. The system may be restricted by the 
regulations of the government overseeing the intermediary Centralized Exchange; similarly the 
trading participants’ transaction history could be exposed.

The Semi-Decentralized Linker system is the most efficient method to validate the exchange 
of Linker coin and coins, which do not embed smart contract. The  Linker Coin Foundation will 
continue to work on developing a fully decentralized system which can be embraced by all 
coins.

4.3.4. PEG LINKER

FIGURE 6) PEG LINKER

Pegged Crypto-currency are fixed to the value of their respective fiat-currency. For example, 
crypto-currency development company, Tether designed USD Tether (USDT) which is 
synchronized with the value of USD. Tether actively manages their exchange such that one 
USDT always equals USD.

Pegged crypto-currencies are especially useful to e-commerce retailers, as they do not want 
to be exposed to the high fluctuations of currently listed crypto-currencies. For example the 
Bitcoins used to buy a sweater online may increase or decrease far beyond the value of the 
sweater by the time the reltailer can convert them. USDT crypto-currency pegged to USD can 
be used just like a fiat currency in a store. 

Linker Coin is exchageable to Pegged Crypto-currency through Linker.  Linker Coin Foundation 
takes the role of maintating the value of the Pegged Crypto-currency and provides the 
necessary liquidity.

Since a Pegged Crypto-currency’s value is stable, it could be practically used to buy or sell 
products. However, the existing system is not usable because of the low transaction speed due 
to indefinite finality of PoW and PoS.

The existing system are built on PoW and PoS consensus systems; requiring enough time to 
prove the transaction. On average this process takes six blocks, which means that a Bitcoin 
purchase takes an hour to prove and an Ethereum purchase takes a full minute. Furthermore, 
there is uncertainty if the block were the transaction is recorded will be included larger, 
complete, blockchain.  To alleviate this problem, PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) 
consensus algorithm solves the indefinite finality problem, and validates the transaction 
almost instantly.

4.3.5. LINKER X

If a yet ot be issued coin is created on a new network, that network can be linked to the Linker 
Network in two ways; if the network embeds the smart contract, the network links to the 
Linker Coin through the Decentralized Linker system, otherwise the network links through the 
Semi-Decentralized Linker system.

4.4.	 LINKER TO REAL NETWORK

4.4.1. SEMI-DECEN_R LINKER

In each country, financial institution and the governmental organizations have started to 
accpet Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is built on PoW, which delays the confirmation time. Furthermore, 
if the blockchain separates due to repeated proofs of work, the transaction may be reversed; 
Therefore, while the time for creating a block is ten minutes, but the whole process to 
validate a transaction takes an hour. This is too slow for financial institutions and government 
organization and  a new substitute technology is required.

Lightning Network is an example of one of these new substitute technologies. It processes 
the transaction data in an external network and calls the final results of the transaction when 
ready; this drastically enhances transaction speeds. It also uses HTCLs(Hashed Time-Lock 
Contracts) to prevent the abuse of the system. 

Linker Coin Foundation will provide the system embeds the Lightning Network or other 
enhanced networks to validate the transaction between users and financial institution or 
governmental organization. We propose to call the system ‘Semi-Decen_R Linker’ which 
means the Linker connecting the Linker Coin and the Real World (e.g. fianacial institution) 
through a Semi-Decentralized Linker.

4.4.2. ETHEREUM_R LINKER

As Semi-Decen_R Linker is the transaction network connecting Bitcoin to  financial institutions 
for Linker Coin users; Ethereum_R Linker is the transaction network connecting Ethereum and 
financial institutions. Just as Bitcoin transaction speed is enhanced by the Lightning Network, 
Ethereum transaction speed is enhanced by the network such as Raven Network. The Linker 
Coin Foundation will provide a system applying the newest technology to connect the Linker 
Coin users with their financial institutions. Proposed system will be called ‘Ethereum_R Linker’.
