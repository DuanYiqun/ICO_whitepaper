 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

 

Abstract 
 

The world is full of points and miles. Every company we face runs a loyalty program utilizing points. 

These point markets are worth more than 300 billion dollars and grow at 6% per year. However, it 

means that there are as many different types of points as there are many businesses around the 

world. Desperately, this makes it difficult for customers to manage and utilize their points. Even for 

businesses, the unused points result in the lower-than-expected performance of their loyalty 

programs and increase their debt in a negative way. 

 

Pointium is a blockchain-based point management platform addressing these problems. The users of 

Pointium can easily integrate and manage Pointium tokens and their points for each company 

around the world in the Pointium Wallet. The users can also easily exchange their points for 

Pointium tokens, or Pointium tokens for the partnership’s points. In addition, the Pointium Wallet 

includes the Promotion Feed, which provides the users with the promotion or coupon of the 

partnerships in real time. This enables Pointium's partnerships to reach more customers and to 

promote more loyalty programs. Moreover, in Pointium Shop, the users can purchase the products 

or services of the partnerships. 

 

To provide the users of Pointium with the reasonable exchange rate, Pointium operates two 

economic models. The first one is the Pointium Exchange Model. According to the model, the 

partnerships of Pointium can determine their own exchange rates for buy/sell and can also set the 

minimum points for exchange. This model lets the market decide the exchange rate, and gives the 

partnerships the full control to reduce their point debts. However, this model alone has a limitation: 

this can enable the Pointium users to experience the exchange loss. Therefore, the Pointium 

secondly aims to provide a more reasonable exchange rate for the users by operating the Promotion 

Incentive Model. Basically, it is the way to provide the users with more promotions of the 

partnerships who actively participate in the exchange. In this way, the partnerships try to establish 

the more reasonable exchange rate to promote more loyalty programs. Also, the model makes 

Pointium partnerships and users more actively participate in the Pointium. 

 

Pointium is developed as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum platform and can benefit from the 

blockchain technology. Pointium targets from the airline, hotel, and travel agency, which are the 

largest company in the point market, to online shopping malls around the world. With these 

advantages, Pointium, based on more powerful, secure, and efficient blockchain technology, will 

lead the 300 billion dollars of the point markets in the world.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background 
 

Point and Its Function 
 

Points and Miles are largely taken up in our economic activities. According to the survey, two-thirds 

of Americans use points systems from the 29 different businesses, on average. For example, when 

flying in an airplane for a business trip, using a credit card, or using an Internet shopping mall, points 

are accumulated at any time. Typically, these points are given a certain percentage of the purchase 

amount when we buy goods and services. For customers, the points reduce the price of products by 

allowing them to use points like cash for the purchases of goods and services in the future. For 

businesses, they can expect the increased loyalties of customers and can encourage customers to 

focus on their services. 

 

Market Cap of Points 

 

The size of the point market is estimated at around 90 billion dollars per year in the US alone, and 

the global point market is worth over 300 billion dollars. Especially, points and miles system is the 

most active in the travel industry. In the case of airline companies, one airline operates a point 

worth 2 billion dollars per year. Globally, more than 100 billion dollars each year is operated by 

airlines around the world. The size of the point market is growing along with the global economy, 

and the market size is increasing by 6% every year.

1.2. Problem 
 

Difficulties of Point Management 
 

As there are many businesses around the world, customers are overwhelmed by too many points 

systems. Customers find it difficult to tell what kind of business points they have. It is also difficult to 

tell how many points you have for a particular company. This deteriorates accessibility to the points 

and prevents the customer from using the points. As points are some kind of assets, it means that 

the customers cannot use their assets sufficiently. For businesses, it leads the lower-than-expected 

performance of loyalty programs. In fact, the survey found that only 50 percent of customers benefit 

from the point system, and 20 percent of them reported that they have never used their points 

before. 

 

 

Disappeared Points Every Year 
 

Many companies make expiration dates for points. For example, a company might pay points to a 

customer and then set it to use for only five years. From the customer's point of view, this method 

makes the point disappear every year without knowing where and how much of it is. In fact, the 

survey shows that 25% of users have lost their points because the points had been expired. This 

disappearing point leads to unnecessary social and technological costs, and to a loss to the market 

economy. 

 

 

Lower-than-Expected Performance of Loyalty Program 

 

Points are a most important factor in the loyalty programs. Companies operate the point system 

because they expect more loyalty from their customers than the cost of issuing the points. But if 

people do not use points, businesses cannot be able to run the loyalty program as they intended. 

This causes unnecessary costs for businesses. 

 

 

  



 

  5 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

Increased Businesses’ Debts due to Low-Utilization 

  

It is easy to think that points are free for businesses because they are virtual money that they 

produce and give to customers. However, because customers can actually use points instead of cash, 

the point to the company is recorded as debt. In other words, if a company pays 10% of the 

purchase price in points, the same amount of the debt should be accumulated. This system can have 

a negative influence on businesses. If many customers do not spend points, the companies will be 

badly appraised by rating agencies and investors because of their increased debt ratios. This bad 

evaluation, in turn, can make the stock prices of business fallen. 

 

 

Social Costs due to Low-Utilization 
 

The development of the point system is expensive. Companies should deploy many developers to 

build point systems, create and maintain servers and databases to manage points. The point being 

underutilized, however, means that these development costs are part of the waste. This results in a 

loss for the company, loss for the career of developers who developed it, and unnecessary 

experience for the customer. All of this creates a social cost. 

 
 

1.3. Solution 
 

Pointium: Global Decentralized Point Platform 

 

Pointium solves these problems by integrating the current point system. Pointium users can manage 

all their points at once, and exchange unused points for Pointium tokens, and exchange their 

Pointium tokens for the points of other partnerships. Also, Pointium can automatically convert the 

to-be-expired points into Pointium tokens and prevent the points from being disappeared. Pointium 

provides the partnerships with the right to determine the exchange rate so that they can effectively 

eliminate their debt and utilize the Pointium’s Promotion Feed to reach more customers. Pointium 

effectively addresses these issues while providing more promotional opportunities for users and 

businesses. In particular, Pointium will provide a valuable experience to travelers by targeting the 

airline and other travel industries.

2. Pointium Project 
 

2.1. Features of Pointium  
 

Pointium is a blockchain-based decentralization solution which solves the problems of current 

loyalty programs using points. Key features of Pointium include Pointium Wallet, Pointium Exchange, 

Promotion Feed, and Pointium Shop. 

 

 

 

 

 

Pointium Wallet: Integrated Points Management Platform 
 

Pointium users can manage all their points through the Pointium Wallet. Users can check how many 

the points remain and the expiration date of the points. The partnerships of Pointium can register 

their business information and the database of points at Pointium. Pointium Wallet is a core user 

interface utilizing Pointium and will be available both on the Web and on mobile.

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

Pointium Exchange 
 

In Pointium Wallet, the users of Pointium can exchange their points for Pointium tokens, or their 

Pointium tokens for the points of partnerships. Moreover, the Pointium Wallet enables the users to 

check the exchange rate between Pointium tokens and the points of the partnership in real time. 

The minimum points for exchange can be also checked. The exchange rate and minimum points for 

exchange are determined by each partnership (refer to 2.2.1. Pointium Exchange Model). 

 

As the ERC-20 Ethereum token, the exchange of Pointium tokens is processed as a transaction on the 

Ethereum. In this regards, the exchange rate of each partnership will be the price of Pointium token 

per their point on the smart contract of Ethereum. The minimum quantities of each partnership for 

exchange will be also processed on the smart contract. 

  

If the users of Pointium request to exchange their points for Pointium tokens, the partnerships 

should have that amount of Pointium tokens. The partnerships then receive the users’ points and 

give their Pointium tokens. If the users wish to exchange their Pointium tokens for the points of 

partnership, the partnership gives the points and receives the users’ Pointium tokens. Once the 

exchange is completed, these transaction records are kept in the permanent and irreversible manner 

on the Ethereum. 

 

 

Promotion Feed 
 

Pointium can pass on promotion information from the partnership to the user through the 

Promotion feed. Promotion Feed is the real-time communication channel between partnerships and 

users and is the global marketing programs offered by Pointium. This allows users to quickly find out 

more special offers and partnerships to offer loyalty programs to more customers. Also, Promotion 

Feed provides the filtering algorithms such that the users and partnerships give or send the 

appropriate information. Promotion Feed is the core feature of circulation model for Pointium, 

connected to the Promotion Incentive Model (refer to 2.2.2. Promotion Incentive Model).

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

Pointium Shop 
 

As the ERC-20 Token of Ethereum, Pointium tokens can be used for purchasing the products or 

services of the Pointium partnerships. Alternatively, the users can exchange their Pointium tokens 

for the points of the partnership and use it for buying the products as the traditional points. 

 

Moreover, Pointium Shop is available to users and partnerships. In the Pointium Shop, the users can 

purchase the products of partnerships for Pointium tokens or the points of partnerships. The 

partnerships can upload their products or services and the prices of them at Pointium Shop. This 

provides the more purchase channels with the users and partnerships. If the payment is completed, 

the users follow the delivery process of its partnership. 

 

 

2.2. Circulation Model of Pointium 
 

Pointium Exchange Model 
 

 

The partnerships of Pointium can determine the exchange rate between Pointium tokens and their 

points. For example, imagine that the company A gives you the points that are worth 10 % of your 

purchase (1 points per 10 dollars). When a customer pays 100 dollars, the company gives the 

customer 10 points which are worth 10 dollars. After the payment, the company’s debt also 

Market model of Pointium’s prices and quantities 



 

  9 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

increases as much as 10 dollars. Because the points can be used like cash for payment in future, it is 

similar to the 10% discount.  

 

Let us say the 1 Pointium token is worth 1 dollar. If the company determined the exchange rate as 1 

Pointium token per 1 point, the company can exchange their points without any profits or losses. 

However, assume that the company determined the exchange rate as 2 Pointium tokens per 1 point. 

By selling their points for Pointium tokens, the company can gain the profit of 100% and reduce their 

debt. This profit is transferred to the loss of customers. 

 

 

Of course, if the company set the exchange ratio (Pointium per point) too low so the customers’ loss 

increases, then the demand of the customers’ exchange will decrease. Because the decreased 

demands of exchange then will cause the decreased volume of exchange, the company cannot 

optimally benefit from the exchange profit. Also, if the company set the exchange ratio too high, the 

company again cannot optimally benefit because the profits per a transaction decreased. According 

to the market economy, therefore, the exchange rate that the company decided will be determined 

in the optimal way to reduce the company’s debt. Moreover, the exchange ratio will be explicitly 

provided in Pointium Wallet, the users can decide whether they proceed to exchange or not with the 

full information about the exchange rate.  

 

One might be concerned that the company will not want to exchange their points as soon as their 

customers get points because this might be negative to form the customers’ loyalties. To solve this 

problem, Pointium gives to the partnerships the right to set the minimum points for requests for 

exchange. In this way, the partnerships of Pointium can benefit from the more opportunities for 

marketing with no losses of the customers’ loyalty. 

Changes of prices and quantities of Pointium as a function of demands 



 

  10 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

 

Through this system of Pointium, the partnerships and the users can exchange the Pointium tokens 

or the points in their own decisions. This is more efficient and decentralized system than the system 

which a particular platform determined the exchange rate. However, this system alone might cause 

two problems. First, since the exchange rate can be determined only by the companies, the 

companies can determine in the manner that maximizes their profits but minimizes the customers’ 

profits. The loss of customers caused by this can eventually reduce the usability and network effects 

of Pointium. 

 

Secondly, if the company set the price of points too low, the company can benefit from the 

marketing opportunities by Promotion Feed without any volumes of exchange transactions. This 

might lead to the tragedy of the commons and incentivize for the company to determine the 

unreasonable exchange rate. To prevent this, Pointium operates the Promotion Incentive Model, 

which is as follows. 

  



 

  11 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

Promotion Incentive Model 
 

Pointium designed the Promotion Incentive Model to enable the businesses to provide (1) more 

reasonable exchange rate (2) more actively. The basic rationale is as follows. The partnerships of 

Pointium can reach more users in Promotion Feed as the partnerships set the price of their points 

higher and the exchange of the partnerships more actively occurs. On the other hand, if the 

partnership set the point price too low and the volume of exchange converges to zero, the 

partnerships’ probability of reaching customer will be close to zero. To implement this idea, 

Pointium developed the simple formula: 

 

 

𝐸𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑡 =  ∑ (
𝐸𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠

𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑙𝑦 𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠
)

𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑙 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟
+ 𝜀 

 

𝑃(𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑)𝑡 =  
(𝐸𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑡−1)

∑ 𝐸𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑡−1𝐴𝑙𝑙 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑠
 

  

 

Exchanged Points Ratio (EPR) is the ratio of how many newly issued points are exchanged across all 

users of the specific partnership in a month. This EPR will be used to obtain the probability of 

reaching the customers for the partnership in next month. The probability of being posted in 

Promotion Feed for the partnership is calculated by the partnership’s Exchanged Points Ratio divided 

by the sum of EPRs across all partnerships. 

 

This method utilizing EPRs has two special advantages. First, the EPR can consider the partnerships’ 

decisions about the reasonable exchange rate and the encouragement of exchange. For example, if 

the partnerships determine the more reasonable exchange rate, then the users of the partnership 

will be more willing to exchange their points for Pointium tokens. Eventually, this will lead to 

increase the EPRs of the partnership. Moreover, this method can provide the incentive for the 

partnership to encourage the exchange of Pointium tokens as their own way. 

 

If the metric is not EPR but absolute exchanged points, there can be threats that the larger 

companies are more likely to post in the Promotion Feed, regardless of exchange rate. Furthermore, 

with the EPR, the Promotion Feed cannot be run by the monopolies of several partnerships. By 

providing more reasonable and fair opportunities with the partnerships, the ecosystem and network 

of Pointium will be maximized. 

  



 

  12 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

2.3. Pointium Community 
 

In a sense, every project is doomed to discover the unexpected problems during development. To 

alleviate the effects of problems by a collective intelligence, Pointium is willing to operate a Pointium 

Community.  

 

 

Open Data for Exchange Rates, Transaction Rates, and 
Promotion Ratio 
 

The core models of Pointium are the Pointium Exchange Model and Promotion Incentive Model. 

These models are mathematically operable, programmable, and quantifiable. Pointium will provide 

the information of these models, such as the exchange rates, transaction records, and the promotion 

ratio. Pointium Community will find it helpful to develop and test the economy and circulation 

models. 

 

 

Voting for System Change 
 

If the community finds the substantial problems of Pointium Exchange Model and Promotion 

Incentive Model, the community can pose the problems and vote for changing the system.  

By voting, the community can change the algorithms of Pointium Exchange Model and Promotion 

Incentive Model. This will be completed on the smart contract of Ethereum.

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

3. Pointium Incentivize Strategies 
 

3.1. For Pointium Users 
 

Improved Usability of Point Management 
 

Pointium enables users to manage their points at once. The users can easily check how many their 

points are left and when the expiration date of the points is. Therefore, the users can easily access 

their points distributed in the world and plan to use them. This will effectively decrease the 

disappeared points every year. Moreover, the users can exchange their unwanted points for 

Pointium tokens and utilize them. 

 

 

Increased Number of Channels for Points Usage 
 

Pointium users can easily access more products and services of the businesses through Pointium 

Shop. They can purchase the products of the partnerships with Pointium tokens or with the points of 

the partnerships. Furthermore, the users can take the partnerships’ promotion such as redeem 

coupons through Promotion Feed. If the users overwhelmed by too many information, they can also 

filter out the unwanted partnerships or filter in the partnerships they love. 

 

 

Prompt Information Gathering through Promotion Feed 
 

With countless business around the world, it is almost impossible to check their promotions 

individually. Pointium effectively provides the promotions to the users. Especially, because the 

Promotion Feed will be operated in real time, the users can receive, for example, the special 

discounts of the airline most promptly. Considering that the most promotions are quickly closed, it is 

valuable features for the users. 

 

 

  



 

  14 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

3.2. For Pointium Partnerships 
 

The incentives of the partnership are most important to our Pointium project. Acknowledging these 

characteristics, Pointium sufficiently considered how the partnerships will be incentivized. The ideas 

are as follows. 

 
 

Reaching the More Customers 
 

In Pointium Wallet, each partnership has the right to access the users of Pointium. This implies the 

more latent customers and demands. Because the successful marketing is critical for the businesses, 

Pointium can be a useful method to reach more customers for the businesses with a minimum cost. 

Moreover, the partnerships can provide their promotions with the users selectively, such as all users 

of Pointium or the specific users who follow the specific partnerships. 

 

 

More Opportunity for Marketing and Loyalty Programs 
 

Pointium Promotion Feed is a core feature that enables the partnerships to use the Pointium. In the 

Promotion Feed, the partnerships can promote the redeem coupons, the loyalty programs, or the 

special offers. Furthermore, the posts can include the function of exchange and payment so that the 

partnerships can sell their products directly in the Promotion Feed. Importantly, the Promotion Feed 

is connected to the Promotion Incentive Model. Based on this model, the partnerships encourage 

the more exchanges and reach the more customers. 

 

 

Effective Debt Reduction through Exchange Rate 
 

Each partnership determines their exchange rate between the points and Pointium tokens. In this 

process, the partnerships can profit from the profit exchange rate. For example, if a partnership set 

the lower prices of their points, the partnership can receive the relatively higher amount of points 

and give the relatively lower amount of Pointium tokens. Furthermore, the partnerships can benefit 

from the different exchange rates of buy and sell. By so doing, the partnerships can effectively 

reduce their debt. 

  



 

  15 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

4. Advantages of Pointium 
 

Pointium is a blockchain-based ERC-20 Token on Ethereum platform. We next introduce the full of 

advantages of Pointium. 

 

4.1. Block-Chain Technology 
 

Improved Security from Hackers 
 

As a blockchain-based application, Pointium is superior to the traditional system in terms of the 

security from the outside hackings. Specifically, the exchange and payment in the Pointium are 

processed as the transaction on the Ehtereum platform. The characteristics that the transactions are 

chained in every block of Ethereum extremely decreases the possibilities of being hacked (as almost 

impossible). 

 

 

Trustworthy of Transaction 
 

The process of exchange in Pointium is proceeded by the proof-of-work or the proof-of-stake on the 

Ehtereum platform. As the majority of honest nodes verifies the transactions and blocks, Pointium 

can guarantee the trustworthy of the transaction without any middleman and server. Because this 

system is as reliable as that of the bank, it provides the basis of trustworthy of transactions for the 

users and partnerships. 

 

 

Transparency of Transaction 
 

All transaction records can be searched in the Etherscan by everyone and are stored permanently. 

Therefore, the users and partnerships of Pointium become under mutual surveillance. If someone 

maliciously exploits the exchange of Pointium tokens, the Pointium Team and Community can find it 

and pose the problem. Actually, the permanent records of transactions make it extremely risky to 

attempt the malicious behavior itself. 

 

 

  



 

  16 

 POINTIUM | Global Decentralized Platform for Points Management & Loyalty Programs 

Improved Economic Feasibility through Cost Savings 
 

Pointium can achieve at least four cost savings by using blockchain technologies. First, Pointium does 

not need to create servers and databases for exchange. The servers and databases will be based on 

the distributed computers on Ethereum platform. Second, Pointium does not need to consider 

securities for preventing the exchange from being hacked. This is also will be resolved under the 

Ethereum platform. Third, because the exchange under Pointium is reliable and transparent due to 

the blockchain technologies, Pointium can greatly save the costs for trustworthy. Finally, the records 

of exchange and transaction will be validated and stored in the Ethereum, the costs of accounting 

can also be greatly reduced. 

 

The costs for making servers, databases, security, reliability, and accountings are magnificent. By 

saving these costs, the benefits of savings will be transferred to the users and the partnerships in 

Pointium. Therefore, the more users and partnerships can participant in the Pointium. 

 

 

4.2. Easy and Accessible UX/UI for Users and 
Partnerships 
 

Accessibility through Pointium Wallet 
 

Pointium plans to develop Pointium Wallet in both Web and Mobile applications. This greatly 

increases the accessibility for users to use Pointium services. The users can use Pointium Wallet 

anytime, anywhere through Pointium Web. In addition, by installing Pointium Wallet App on the 

users’ smartphone, they can manage points and Pointium in real time and receive promotional 

information of partnerships. 

 

 

Applicability through Open API 
 

Companies that want to partnership with Pointium can easily add Pointium to their services through 

Pointium Application Programming Interface (API). As the applicability of Pointium is directly related 

to the usability of API, the Pointium API will be supported in a wide variety of programming 

languages. Pointium API will be discussed with the Pointium Team and Community with several use 

cases attached.

5. Terms of Token Sale 
 

5.1. Token Sale 
 

Pointium Token (PNT) is an ERC-20 Token based on Ethereum platform. It is compatible with the 

ERC-20 wallets such as MyEtherWallet and Metamask. 

 

During the pre-sale and crowd-sale, Pointium will provide 800,000,000 PNT, which are equal to 50% 

of total supply (1,600,000,000 PNT). The remained tokens will be burned. 

 

The ICO participants can repetitively participant in the pre-sale and crowd-sale. Before participation,
