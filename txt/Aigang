Executive	Summary	
	
We	are	 rushing	 into	an	era	of	pervasive	connectedness.	55	billion	 Internet	of	Things	 (IoT)	
devices	will	be	bought	over	the	next	eight	years.	Most	of	them	will	be	able	to	diagnose	their	
own	 operating	 state	 and	 communicate	 imminent	 failure.	 Because	 none	 of	 this	 requires	
human	verification,	 there	 is	 an	opportunity	 for	automated	 insurance	products	 -	 insurance	
that	verifies	claim	events	and	pays	claims	automatically.	
	
There	is	a	second	opportunity.	Most	IoT	devices	collect	data.	Drones,	sensors	and	cameras	
can	 send	 data	 that	 can	 be	 used	 as	 an	 input	 to	 insurance	 calculations.	 This	 will	 see	 an	
explosion	in	the	number	and	diversity	of	insurance	products.	
	
With	smart	contracts	and	a	 tokenised	system	that	assesses	 risk,	we‘re	building	a	platform	
for	autonomous	 insurance,	usable	by	any	manufacturer	or	 insurer.	Here	 is	the	pathway	to	
that:	
	
Harness	the	wisdom	of	the	crowd	

- Form	prediction	markets	whose	members	(token	holders)	are	subject	specialists	and	
insurance	enthusiasts	

- Combine	prediction	markets	with	insurance	pools	
- Use	prediction	markets	to	assess	insurance	risk	
- Construct	 algorithms	 that	 price	 the	 policy	 premiums	 and	 predict	 profitability	 of	

insurance	pools	
- Develop	 a	 token	 model	 that	 incentivises	 and	 rewards	 members	 for	 accurate	

insurance	market	predictions	
- Create	a	network	effect	so	that	all	token	holders	benefit	from	the	efficiencies	of	the	

system,	regardless	of	their	individual	forecasting	success 	
Automate	through	smart	contracts	

- Create	a	Decentralised	Autonomous	Organisation	(DAO)	that	uses	smart	contracts	to	
connect	intelligent	devices	with	insurance	policies	

- Connect	to	devices	that	communicate	their	need	for	maintenance	or	replacement	
- Automate	insurance	payouts	
- Use	re-insurance	to	handle	exceptions	
- Automatically	sell	tokens	or	issue	payments	to	keep	reserves	within	target	range 	

Partner	with	data	providers	
- Seek	out	manufacturers	who	already	collect	data	on	their	devices’	operating	states	
- Collect	data	from	drones	and	sensors	that	would	help	inform	insurance	risks		
- Use	device	data	as	intelligence	in	valuing	and	creating	policies 	

Subject	to	the	regulatory	environment,	encourage	third	parties	to	create	insurance	offerings	
using	the	platform	

- Cooperate	 with	 manufacturers	 wanting	 to	 pre-install	 insurance	 policies	
	

The	global	 IoT	 insurance	market	 is	expected	to	be	worth	USD	42.7	Billion	by	2022	and	we	
are	positioning	ourselves	as	a	significant	innovator	in	that	space.	
	



We	have	demonstrated	a	proof	of	concept	with	working	apps,	 integrated	feeds	 from	data	
suppliers,	all	required	algorithms	and	business	logic.	We	now	require	funds	to	build	a	fully	
operational	 platform,	 develop	partnerships	with	 data	 suppliers,	 extend	our	 organisational	
infrastructure	and	promote	the	platform	on	an	appropriate	scale.	  	
	

	
 	



Why	the	blockchain	
	
Aspects	 of	 blockchain	 architecture	 will	 re-make	 the	 insurance	 industry.	 A	 serverless,	
transparent,	decentralised	ledger	means	claim	histories	can	be	permanently	and	definitively	
recorded.	We’ll	be	able	to	prove	date	and	time	of	policy	issuance,	or	product	purchase	date,	
and	 confirm	 subsequent	 ownership	 and	 location	 changes.	 The	 ability	 to	 authoritatively	
timestamp	claims	will	see	easier	reconciliations	for	reinsurance	and	improved	audibility.	In	
some	 cases	 it	may	mitigate	 insurance	 fraud.	 The	 blockchain	 can	 deliver	 a	 higher	 level	 of	
transparency	 and	 trust;	 a	welcome	 outcome	 given	 that	 73%	 of	 people	 do	 not	 trust	 their	
insurer.	
	
Smart	contracts,	which	bring	together	payments	and	programmability,	mean	that	insurance	
contracts	can	be	automatically	executed.	Smart	contracts	can	trigger	payments	when	a	set	
of	conditions	are	met.	Combined	with	the	ability	 to	record	events	 immutably,	 it	will	allow	
for	 automated	 claim	 handling.	 Earthquake,	 flood	 and	 drought	 information	 pushed	 to	 the	
blockchain	 could	 eliminate	 the	 need	 for	 individual	 assessments,	 allowing	 for	 more	
transparent	payment	criteria	and	reduced	settlement	times.	
	
In	short,	we	are	within	reach	of	the	near-complete	automation	of	the	insurance	process.	
	
The	burgeoning	connectivity	of	IoT	devices,	with	smart	homes,	car	telematics	and	wearables	
at	 the	 forefront,	will	 escalate	 this.	 Sensors,	 cameras	 and	drones	will	 supply	 verified,	 real-
time	data	on	our	work	and	natural	environment;	the	raw	data	that	informs	risk	assessment,	
exposure	and	claim	events.	They	can	inform	feedback	control	processes	which	could	result	
in	 more	 accurate	 policy	 pricing.	   Not	 only	 will	 practically	 all	 consumer	 goods,	 vehicles,	
buildings,	equipment	and	power	grids	know	their	own	operating	state,	they	will	report	their	
predicted	 and	 conclusive	 failure	 dates.	  	
	
Using	 smart	 contracts	we	can	now	encode	on	 the	blockchain	 financial	 instruments,	public	
records,	physical	assets	keys	(locks),	intellectual	property	(including	proof	of	ownership)	and	
other	 empirical	 data	 like	 the	 weather	 and	 traffic	 data.	 This	 information	 can	 be	
programmatically	captured,	and	sensors,	software	or	people	can	be	used	as	oracles	-	trusted	
third	parties	used	by	the	software	to	make	decisions	about	insurance	policies	and	claims.	
		
A	 DAO	 can	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 smart	 contract	 which	 includes	 stakeholders	 and	 rules	 for	
managing	its	own	funds.	Once	built,	 it	makes	business	decisions	and	conducts	transactions	
without	 the	 need	 for	 human	 involvement,	 making	 it	 a	 tremendously	 efficient	 business	
entity.	 In	 2014,	 Long	 Finance	 proposed	 what	 Aigang	 is	 now	 constructing:	 a	 DAO	 which	
operates	 as	 an	 insurance	 platform.  	
	
The	DAO	 structure	 also	 lets	us	use	 tokens	 as	 an	 incentive	mechanism	 to	 reward	 the	best	
informed	 insurance	 experts	 in	 forecasting	 the	 size	 and	 profitability	 of	 different	 insurance	
pools.	 This	 will	 become	 a	 competitive	 edge.	
	



Prediction	markets	(PMs)	
	
In	his	book	‘The	Wisdom	of	Crowds’,	James	Surowiecki	says	“under	the	right	circumstances,	
groups	are	remarkably	intelligent	and	are	often	smarter	than	the	smartest	people	in	them”.	
Google	has	experimented	extensively	 in	 this	area;	using	prediction	markets	 to	predict	 the	
success	 of	 various	 projects.	 Harvard	 Business	 Review	 has	 reported	 on	 the	 success	 of	 the	
Hollywood	Stock	Exchange	(a	prediction	market),	and	the	journal	Nature	recently	published	
a	comprehensive	summary	of	scientific	prediction	markets.	
	
Each	 prediction	 market	 is	 created	 to	 predict	 the	 outcome	 of	 a	 particular	 future	 event.	
People	who	take	opposing	positions	on	the	probability	of	 the	event	cause	a	market	price,	
which	represents	a	consensus.	
	
The	 blockchain	 is	 ideal	 for	 this	 because	 it’s	 decentralised,	 transparent	 and	 cannot	 be	
manipulated.	 Smart	 contracts	 automate	 all	 aspects	 of	 market	 operation	 and	 oracles	 can	
definitively	report	event	outcomes.	
	
A	 simple	 example:	 let’s	 say	 you	 want	 to	 know	 if	 a	 particular	 disaster	 event	 will	 occur.	
Participants	 vote	 yes	 or	 no.	 The	 answers	 are	 turned	 into	 a	 probability.	 If	 70	 per	 cent	 say	
“yes”,	that	becomes	a	contract	you	can	buy	or	sell.	If	the	nominal	value	of	the	contract	is	10	
units,	you	may	buy	the	contract	for	7	units.	If	the	outcome	is	“yes”,	you	are	rewarded	with	3	
units;	if	you’re	wrong,	you	lose	your	7	units.	
	
This	mechanism	also	works	to	predict	a	quantity,	rather	than	a	probability	-	the	likely	share	
price,	 property	 value	 or	 investment	 pool.	 This	 basic	 principle	 can	 be	 extended	 to	 very	
complex	prediction	models.	
	
Using	prediction	markets,	 people	 can	hedge	 their	 exposure	 to	 particular	 events.	 Let’s	 say	
you	live	in	a	flood-prone	area	and	can’t	buy	flood	insurance.	You	could	buy	“yes”	tokens	on	
the	prediction	of	a	flood	in	the	next	five	years.	In	the	event	of	a	flood	you	would	collect	on	
your	prediction	and	use	the	proceeds	to	cover	your	flood	losses.	
	
New	 insurance	 products	 will	 quickly	 emerge.	 Cryptocurrency	 mining	 hardware	 and	
exchanges	 are	 examples	 of	 volatile	 information	 markets.	 PMs	 will	 let	 participants	 insure	
themselves	against	adverse	fluctuations.		
	
With	PMs	insurers	attract	an	informed	group	of	speculators	because	those	who	believe	they	
have	 better	 prediction	 skills	 or	 more	 knowledge	 than	 the	 market	 are	 incentivised	 by	
economic	gain.	With	sufficient	diversity,	their	collective	wisdom	can	be	more	reliable	than	
estimates	by	individual	experts	or	teams	with	the	same	background.	
	
Further,	 if	 your	 company	 invents	 a	 new	 technology	 but	 you	 don’t	 know	 what	 the	
applications	 are,	 you	 could	 predict	 a	 small	market	 size,	 incentivising	 scientists	 to	 explore	
applications	for	the	material.	
	



It	 is	 historically	 difficulty	 assessing	 risk	 in	 the	 information	 security	 risk	management	 area.	
Companies	 could	 buy	 tokens	 predicting	 no	 security	 vulnerabilities	 exist	 in	 their	 software,	
creating	an	incentive	on	the	other	side	of	the	market	for	hackers	to	identify	weaknesses.	
	
Prediction	markets	have	the	potential	to	become	one	of	the	most	disruptive	innovations	in	
data	 science,	which	will	have	a	 strong	effect	on	many	 industries,	but	 there	are	 significant	
regulatory	challenges.	 	Some	governments	are	concerned	that	tokens	used	for	predictions	
resemble	 gambling.	We	are	 confident	 that	 the	efficiency	of	 the	 system	and	 its	 value	 as	 a	
market	 mechanism	 will	 be	 recognised	 over	 time.		
	
	
Insurance	pools	
	
The	 Aigang	 platform	 can	 contribution	 to	 the	 insurance	 industry	 by	 adapting	 prediction	
markets	 to	 insurance	 pools.	 Members	 will	 appraise	 products	 launched	 on	 the	 Aigang	
insurance	protocol.	We	are	crowdsourcing	actuarial	work.	This	 is	a	 framework	 to	 improve	
the	accuracy	of	risk	assessment	and	policy	viability.	
	
Insurers	will	create	tokens	about	the	likelihood	of	events,	then	use	the	price	that	emerges	to	
assess	the	viability	of	that	insurance	product.	
	
Our	PMs	will	deal	with	these	aspects	of	the	insurance	pool: 	
				•	Capital	PM	
				 	Predicts	how	much	capital	(free	reserves)	will	be	raised	to	support	the	pool 	
				•	Premium	PM	
				 	Predicts	the	size	of	the	premium	the	pool	will	amass 	
				•	Profitability	PM	
				 	Predicts	the	loss	ratio	or	some	other	profitability	measure	of	the	pool 	
	
Insurers	will	 use	PMs	 to	 estimate	pool	 sizes.	What	 kinds	of	 climate	 change	 insurance	will	
have	the	lowest	loss	ratios? 	Are	single	event	horse-riding	policies	more	viable	than	annual	
policies?	
	
	
Market	operation	
	
Effective	 prediction	 markets	 have	 three	 main	 properties. 	
	
				•	Diversity	
				 	The	participants	have	different	information	on	which	they	base	their	prediction. 	
				•	Independence	
				 	The	participants	make	their	predictions	independently	of	other	participants’					
	 	opinions.	 	
				•	Decentralisation	
				 	The	market	is	decentralised	rather	than	expert-opinion	led. 	
	



We	 believe	 these	 markets	 will	 work	 most	 efficiently	 if	 we	 create	 an	 incentive	 to	 attract	
participants.	We’ll	do	this	by	rewarding	successful	predictions	once	the	outcome	is	known.	
Those	 rewards	 will	 be	 in	 the	 form	 of	 improved	member	 rank	 and	 additional	 tokens,	 i.e.	
status	and	potential	benefits.	
	
	
Algorithms	
	
The	operation	of	the	prediction	market	is	governed	by	
	
				•				Member	score	
				 	 	Determines	 member	 rank	 and	 weight	 in	 overall	 market	 prediction.	 It’s	 a	
measure	of	prediction	success. 	
				•				Reward	function	
				 	 	Determines	the	reward	granted	for	successful	predictions 	
				•				Value	function	
				 	 	Determines	 the	 value	 of	 the	 whole	 prediction	 market 	
	
The	 algorithm	 below	 describes	 the	 high	 level	 framework	 for	 the	 PM,	 setting	 out	
dependencies	between	components	of	the	model	and	the	desired	properties	of	 functions.	
The	 precise	 nature	 of	 these	 functions	 and	 their	 parameterisation	 will	 be	 refined	 during	
Proof-of-Concept	running	on	Ethereum	Testnet	smart	contracts	with	a	range	of	scenarios.	
	
The	score	of	each	member	i	is	calculated	by	accumulating	rewards	from	all	PMs:	

𝑆" =
$

%&'

∆𝑆"%	

Where	m	is	the	total	number	of	PMs	and	ΔSij	is	the	reward	granted	for	member	i	from	PM	j.	
	
Member	rank	and	weight	are	functions	of	the	score:	
𝑅" = 𝑓(𝑆")	
𝑊" = 𝑓(𝑆")	
	
Market	prediction	is	the	weighted	average	of	individual	predictions:	

𝑃𝑀% =
1

"&'

𝑊"𝑃"%	

	
Where	 n	 is	 the	 total	 number	 of	 members,	 Wi	 is	 the	 weight	 of	 member	 i	 and	 Pij	 is	 the	
prediction	submitted	by	member	i	for	PM	j.	
	
The	reward	function	determines	the	increase	or	decrease	of	the	member	score	and	depends	
on	the	following:	
	
∆𝑆"% = 𝑓(|𝑃"% − 𝑌%|, |𝑃𝑀% − 𝑌%|, 𝑅", 𝑉%)	
	
Where:	



|Pij-Yj|	is	the	distance	of	the	individual	prediction	by	member	i	from	the	actual	outcome	Yj	
|PMj-Yj|	is	the	distance	of	the	market	prediction	PMj	from	the	actual	outcome	Yj	
Ri	is	the	rank	of	member	i	
Vj	is	the	value	of	PM	j	
	
If	 the	 reward	 also	 includes	 additional	 tokens	 the	 number	 of	 tokens	 granted	 can	 be	
calculated	by	modifying	the	same	function.	
	

Example	of	the	Reward	Function	

	

	

Value	function	determines	how	valuable	the	PM	is.	The	value	of	PM	influences	the	rewards	
and	can	 indicate	the	potential	of	the	new	product	to	which	the	PM	is	attached.	Value	 is	a	
function	of	two	measures	–	measure	of	volume	and	measure	of	diversity:	

�� = �(���, ���)	
Measure	of	volume	captures	how	many	participants	took	part	so	it	is	a	function	of	aggregate	
weights	of	participants:	

��� = �(
�

�&1

�����)	

Where	Wi	is	the	weight	of	member	i	and	Iij	is	the	indicator	of	member	i	participation	in	PM	j.	

	

	
 	

  



Smart	policies	
	
Just	as	the	blockchain	guards	against	double	spending	of	currency,	 it	can	ensure	insurance	
policies	are	unique	and	valid.	We	will	have	unalterable,	 timestamped	evidence	of	an	offer	
and	acceptance.	The	rules	that	govern	underwriting,	execution	of	new	policies,	assessments,	
claims	handling,	 the	 repair	process	and	payment	can	all	be	embedded	 in	 smart	contracts.	
Clearly,	 that	 will	 require	 standardisation	 of	 insurance	 cover	 and	 will	 be	 more	 realistic	 in	
some	insurance	product	types	than	others.	
	
From	 the	 viewpoint	 of	 token	holders,	 the	 smart	 contract	would	 automatically	 govern	 the	
terms	and	timing	of	new	policies	as	well	as	the	management	and	distribution	of	pay-outs.	
This	would	disrupt	the	insurance	industry	by	allowing	any	party	to	participate	based	on	a	set	
of	pre-determined	rules.	
Conventional	 insurance	policies	consist	of	 two	sections;	standard	wording	and	a	schedule.	
The	 standard	 wording	 section	 describes	 the	 cover	 provided	 as	 well	 as	 rules,	 rights	 and	
obligations	 of	 parties.	 Those	 writing	 the	 smart	 contract	 must	 specify	 the	 terms	 and	
conditions	under	which	an	 insurer	 is	 liable	 to	pay.	Perils	and	exclusions	are	 likely	 to	differ	
from	conventional	policies.	For	example,	smart	policies	would	not	be	appropriate	where:	
	
The	policyholder	has	more	information	about	the	likelihood	of	a	claim	than	the	insurer	
The	claim	event	is	under	the	control	of	the	policyholder	
The	claim	event	would	be	difficult	to	verify	
Loss	can	be	considered	as	depreciation	
	
The	second	section,	the	schedule	of	the	policy	would	typically	include:	
	
The	details	of	insured	object	
The	excess	or	deductible	
The	sum	insured	
Optional	coverage	
Premium	and	payment	schedule	
	
These	are	likely	to	vary	by	policy	holder.	
	
If	wider	cover	is	sought	than	handled	by	automated	algorithms,	part	of	the	business	could	
be	 reinsured.	 Rules	 for	 this	 can	 be	 coded	 into	 the	 smart	 contract,	 e.g.	 retain	 property	
damage	claims	and	cede	liability	or	retain	smaller	claims	and	cede	claims	above	a	retention	
limit. 	 Smart	 policies	 as	 smart	 contracts	 would	 include	 a	 third	 section	 disclosing	 the	
software	algorithms	executing	the	operations	of	the	insurance	DAO.	
	
	
Black	Box	insurance	
	
An	 aircraft’s	 flight	 systems	 and	 sensors	 are	 connected	 to	 a	 ‘black	 box’,	 used	 to	 identify	
causes	 in	 the	 case	 of	 catastrophic	 disasters.	 IoT	 technology	 means	 that	 many	 insurable	
items	 are	 now	 also	 able	 to	 supply	 detailed	 information	 about	 the	 device	 state	 and	 its	
history.	



	
	
We	 see	 potential	 for	 new	 insurance	 products	 that	monitor	 information	 from	 the	 APIs	 in	
sophisticated	machinery	and	equipment	like	cars,	yachts	and	aircraft.	
	
We	can	monitor	device	performance	over	 time	based	on	 sensors	 in	 the	equipment.	Black	
Box	insurance	could	be	bundled	with	the	vehicle	by	default.	If	required,	the	blockchain	could	
receive	 data	 from	 external	 data	 sources	 to	 retrieve	 extra	 information.	 Quite	 quickly	 we	
would	be	able	to	construct	performance	norms	and	variations.	
	
An	accident	would	trigger	an	event,	or	 the	event	could	be	manually	 reported.	The	system	
would	 immediately	 gather	 sensor	 data,	 then	 register	 the	 claim.  	 Algorithms	 would	
combine	historical	data,	machine	 learning	and	data	 to	evaluate	 the	damage,	calculate	 the	
payout	 and	 finalise	 the	 claim.	  Initially,	we	would	 need	 a	 support	 team	 to	 resolve	 edge	
cases	and	monitor	 fraud	but	we	believe	that	 the	protocol	can	evolve	 to	 fully	autonomous	
insurance	driven	by	AI	and	the	blockchain.	
	
	
Dead	Battery	insurance	
	
For	a	quick	glimpse	of	the	future,	install	our	demonstration.	In	the	simulation	you’ll	buy	an	
insurance	policy	for	your	mobile	phone	battery.	Then	you’ll	make	a	claim,	pretending	your	
phone	has	notified	you	that	battery	failure	is	imminent.	
	
Download	the	Aigang	app	from	the	App	Store	or	Google	Play.	Choose	Get	Insurance	on	the	
phone	battery	screen.	Log	in.	Top	up	with	Testnet	ether.	It	may	take	a	while	to	arrive.	Go	to	
the	Offers	menu	and	choose	battery	insurance.	View	the	Offer	Details	then	select	Evaluate.	
Accept	the	contract	and	before	you	can	say	‘Aigang’;	you’re	insured.	Your	phone	makes	the	
policy	payment	 in	Testnet	ether.	When	you’re	ready	to	make	a	claim,	go	to	Contracts	and	
shake	your	phone.	Presto:	the	ether	payment	 is	on	the	way	and	your	claim	is	settled.	  If	
you’re	running	a	Web3	Ethereum	client	like	Metamask	you	can	also	go	to	the	Demo	page	at	
platform.aigang.network	 and	 review	 the	 dashboard.	 It	 now	 shows	 the	 total	 amount	 set	
aside	to	underwrite	policies,	 the	total	claimed,	and	the	amount	held	 in	reserve.	 Individual	
policies	are	shown	in	the	table	below.		
	
The	mobile	phone	is	a	good	example	of	an	insurable	IoT	device	-	it	has	inbuilt	sensors	which	
can	 detect	 battery	 condition	 and	 degradation.	When	 the	 battery	 reaches	 a	 threshold,	 an	
insurance	payout	can	be	automatically	triggered	by	a	smart	contract.	The	Aigang	software	
can	measure	 the	 current	 battery	 condition,	 associate	 an	 appropriate	 risk	 level	 and	 levy	 a	
suitable	payment	plan.	
	
We	 plan	 to	 transfer	 the	 Testnet	 product	 to	 the	 Main	 Ethereum	 network	 and	 offer	 this	
product	commercially.	
	



	
 	



Data	Providers	
	
Drones	sales	have	tripled	in	the	past	year	and	will	triple	again,	to	seven	million,	by	2020.	
	
We	 will	 partner	 with	 manufacturers	 whose	 devices	 already	 collect	 data	 that	 informs	
insurance	and	actuarial	work.	
	
These	 include	 makers	 of	 drones,	 sensors,	 WiFi-enabled	 and	 GPS-equipped	 devices	 and	
vehicles,	and	consumer	goods.	Collectively,	 these	devices	and	their	metadata	are	the	new	
big	data	inputs	to	numerous	risk-sensitive	markets.	
	
Drones	will	have	a	significant	impact	on	the	crop	insurance	market,	allowing	us	to	delineate	
marginal	 soils	 as	well	 as	predict	 and	assess	 the	extent	of	 crop	 failure.	Checks	 for	building	
damage	post-earthquakes	will	sensibly	be	done	by	drones	in	future.	
	
Insurance	 assessors	 will	 use	 drones	 to	 evaluate	 storm	 damage	 instead	 of	 risking	 life	 and	
limb	on	damaged	roofs.	At	other	times	they’ll	get	a	composite	picture	of	snow	build-up	on	
roofs.	Where	 fire	 is	 a	 risk	 drones	will	 survey	 electricity	 poles	 and	wires	 for	maintenance	
levels,	and	evaluate	firebreaks.	
	
Local	governments	or	their	insurers	will	visually	document	pavements,	roads	and	potholes;	
gas	companies	will	automate	pipeline	inspections.	
	
Pressure	 sensors	 in	 public	 utilities,	 temperature	 sensors	 in	 hazardous	 environments,	 soil	
moisture	sensors	on	farms:	all	these	record	history	and	predict	risk.	
	
Some	of	the	data	collected	will	improve	risk	assessment,	some	will	influence	policy	specifics	
and	some	will	help	process	claims.	
	
This	is	a	key	point	of	difference	for	Aigang.	Our	partnerships	with	data	providers	will	be	built	
around	our	technical	insurance	knowledge,	IT	systems	integration	and	blockchain	expertise.	
	
	
	
 	



Architecture	
	
Our	 team	 is	 building	 a	 Protocol	 on	 the	 Ethereum	 blockchain	 which	 will	 see	 community,	
companies	and	developers	build	their	own	insurance	modules	on	a	decentralised	platform.	
	
The	core	layer	on	our	stack	is	the	blockchain,	on	top	of	which	are	the	Aigang	protocol	and	
service	 layers.	 The	 protocol	 layer	 comprises	 smart	 contracts	 that	 contain	 the	 logic	 for	
insurance	products,	payment	processing	and	the	insurance	products	marketplace.	
	
The	service	layer	provides	these	services:	data	warehouse,	risk	assessment,	reinsurance	and	
risk	pooling.	It	also	handles	the	device	data	API	and	the	SDK	for	insurance	development.	On	
top	of	that	layer	are	the	insurance	products	built	by	Aigang	and	by	other	parties.	
	
	
Core	 components	
	
 Key	 back-end	 components	
	

- Ethereum	Blockchain	
- Smart	contracts	and	insurance	logic	

- Data	warehouse	
- All	data	from	various	devices	

- Machine	learning	algorithm	
- Analytical	tools	

- Tools	for	data	analysis	and	statistical	models	creation,	e.g.	Tableu.	
- Business	logic	API	

- Includes	 all	 the	 logic	 for	 integrations	 with	 various	 IoT	 devices	 and	
manufacturer	APIs,	as	well	as	the	logic	for	data	storage	and	validation	

- Forwarder	API	
- Used	as	a	middle	layer	between	the	blockchain	and	the	front	end.	It	performs	

data	 validation,	 security,	 stores	 user	wallets	 and	 confirms	 transactions.	We	
envisage	 this	 layer	will	 removed	 in	 the	medium	 to	 long	 term	when	we	add	
smart	oracles	as	part	of	the	DAO.	

					
Key	 front-end	 components		
 	

- iOS	and	Android	apps,	which	connect	to	Ethereum	through	the	Forwarder	API 	
	
Contract	structure	
	
Smart	 contracts	 are	 written	 in	 Solidity.	 They	 contain	 the	 rules	 for	 premium	 calculation,	
damage	evaluation	(claim	rules)	and	the	logic	for	payouts.	Smart	contracts	also	enable	the	
vesting	of	reserves	within	smart	contracts,	so	that	stakeholders	can	claim	rewards	according	
to	pre-determined	distribution	rules.	They	will	be	used	in	predictions	market	as	a	mean	of	
decentralizing	predictions	and	rewards.	  	
	



Contracts	are	alpha	versions	and	are	constantly	being	updated.	There	is	considerably	more	
work	to	do.	Our	plan	is	to	use	extant	contracts	as	the	base	protocol	layer	and	upgrade	them	
as	we	progress.	We	have	successfully	baked	 in	upgradability	and	can	now	easily	 integrate	
new	products.	
	
	
Proof	of	Concept	
	
Using	 data	 from	 the	 battery	 insurance	 smart	 contracts,	 proof	 of	 concept	 has	 been	
demonstrated	for	the	insurance	protocol	and	the	workability	of	the	platform.	IoT	and	smart	
device	data	has	been	used	to	develop	a	working	insurance	product	in	the	Testnet	Ethereum	
environment,	and	has	been	implemented	for	iOS	and	Android	apps.	
	
Github:	github.com/AigangNetwork/aigang-forwarder	
	
Also	in	the	Testnet	environment	we	have	demonstrated	the	operation	of	the	DAO	insurance	
platform,	 including	 contributions	 to	 insurance	 pools	 and	 claiming	 rewards	 from	 writing	
insurance.			
	
The	web	UI	is	operational	and	we	have	integrated	with	the	Ethereum	wallet	Metamask.	
	
In	terms	of	smart	contracts,	we	have	demonstrated	the	ability	to	issue	policies,	conduct	risk	
assessment	 and	 process	 claims.	 Our	 smart	 contracts	 can	 perform	 insurance	 profitability	
calculations,	create	reserves	and	tokenise	the	insurance	risk	pool.	The	protocol	architecture	
successfully	integrates	other	insurance	products.

Competition	
	
AXA,	AIG,	others	
Existing	insurance	companies	
	
Large,	established	insurance	companies	are	collaborating	to	learn	about	the	blockchain,	are	
dabbling	in	smart	contracts	and	offer	a	competitive	threat.	However,	they	will	be	reluctant	
to	undermine	existing,	profitable	models	and	will	move	carefully	and	slowly,	constrained	by	
conservative	management	and	large	 legal	departments.	We	will	move	quickly,	 learn	as	we	
go,	 attract	 a	 group	of	 early-adopter	 insurance	 specialists	 interested	 in	 prediction	markets	
and	work	flexibly	with	IoT/data	companies	of	all	sizes.		
	
Etherisc		
etherisc.com	
Blockchain	decentralised	insurance	solution	
	
The	 Etherisc	 team	 focuses	 on	 insurance	 solutions	 collecting	 external	 data	 (weather,	 flight	
delays,	 etc.)	 to	 validate	 claims	 and	 issue	 payouts.	 It	 targets	 ‘semi-automated’	 claims,	 not	
Aigang’s	 ‘fully	 autonomous’.	   Aigang	 is	 specifically	 working	 with	 IoT	 devices	 and	 the	
information	they	generate,	as	well	as	sensors	and	third-party	data.	
	
Etherisc	 is	 concentrating	 on	 reinsurance	 risk	 and	 new	 types	 of	 insurance.	 Aigang	 is	 a	
platform	the	insurance	industry	can	use	to	improve	the	profitability	and	adoption	of	existing	
products,	though	its	prediction	markets	will	also	prompt	product	innovation.	
	
	
Gnosis		
gnosis.pm	
Blockchain	prediction	market	
	
The	 stated	 Gnosis	 vision	 is	 to	 have	 a	 variety	 of	 prediction	market	 applications	 (including	
insurance	calculation	and	claims	processing)	built	atop	the	same	platform	and	liquidity	pool.	
There	is	no	incentive	mechanism	built	 in	to	Gnosis	to	reward	accurate	predictions,	and	we	
believe	Aigang	will	be	more	attractive	to	insurance	industry	specialists.	
	
Gnosis	do	not	plan	to	collect	data	from	IoT	devices	for	the	purpose	of	modelling	insurance	
profitability	and	viability.	
	
	
Augur	augur.io	
The	first	blockchain	prediction	market	
	
Unlike	Gnosis,	Augur	does	not	 solicit	 third	parties	 to	build	prediction	market	applications.	
Instead,	it	encourages	participants	to	predict	individual	outcomes	using	the	Augur	network.	
It	does	not	specifically	target	insurance	industry	applications.	



	
	
iXledger	(formerly	InsureX)	ixledger.com	
Peer-to-peer	insurance	trading	
	
InsureX	 was	 to	 be	 the	 first	 blockchain-based	 marketplace	 for	 the	 trading	 of	 insurance	
products,	but	there	are	no	smart	contracts	involved.	  Insurers,	reinsurers	and	brokers	can	
use	iXledger	to	trade	insurance	products	directly.	It’s	a	reinsurance	play	with	the	emphasis	
on	 health	 and	 life	 insurance.	 Although	 blockchain-based,	 this	 venture	 does	 not	 leverage	
prediction	markets	to	add	valuable	information	to	insurance	market	interactions.

Marketing	plan	
	
Our	business	is	positioned	as	the	autonomous	insurance	platform.	We	have	three	points	of	
difference.	
	

1. Our	integration	with	IoT	devices	such	that	insurance	products	can	be	pre-bundled	at	
point	of	sale	then	fully	automated	all	the	way	through	to	the	settlement	of	claims	

2. The	 construction	 of	 a	 prediction	 markets	 platform	 specialising	 in	 insurance	
applications,	and	attracting	specialists	through	financial	and	status	incentives.	

3. Strategic	partnerships	with	data-collecting	devices	with	 the	objective	of	using	 their	
information	for	improved	insurance	intelligence  	

	
Key	aspects	of	the	plan	include:	
	
	
Promotion	
	
Conventional	media	

- Press	releases	and	follow-ups	from	public	relations	professionals	
- Paid	promotion	of	our	bounty	program	targeting	insurance	industry	professionals	

	
Personal	attendance	

- We	will	 take	 Aigang	 roadshows	 around	 the	 globe,	 (initially	 Europe)	 aiming	 at	 the	
following	constituencies	

- Insurance	 industry	 professionals	 who	 have	 the	 capacity	 to	 develop	 or	 test	
products	on	the	platform	

- Insurance	 industry	 professionals	 (current	 and	 semi-retired)	 who	 may	
participate	in	prediction	markets	

- IoT	businesses	and	developers	
- Developers	with	the	ability	to	create	insurance	products	on	the	network	

- We	 will	 actively	 participate	 at	 insurance	 conferences,	 IoT	 conferences	 and	
blockchain	 events,	 seeking	 speaking	 opportunities	 and	 taking	 up	 small,	 strategic	
sponsorship	 opportunities 	
	

Social	media,	through	these	channels:	
- Twitter,	 targeting	 both	 blockchain	 and	 business	 industry	

journalists/influencers	
- Interviews	on	reputable	media	websites	and	on	business	podcasts	
- medium.com	articles	and	posts	on	credible	finance	and	business	platforms	
- Educative	webinars	and	explainer	videos	on	YouTube	and	Facebook	

	
	
Partnerships	
	

- Partnerships	 with	 data	 providers	 are	 integral	 to	 our	 business	 offering.	 They	 also	
broadcast	 the	 possibilities	 of	 the	 network	 on	 a	 broad	 scale.	 We	 will	 aggressively	
pursue	drone	application	software	developers	and	other	 insurance	 institutions.	We	



will	 have	 a	 small	 number	 of	memberships	 in	 influential	 associations	 (including	 the	
Enterprise	Ethereum	Alliance)	and	will	actively	participate	in	those	bodies. 	

	
	
Processes 	
	

- We	plan	 to	 use	 state	 of	 the	 art	marketing	 automation	 to	 track	 acquisition,	 usage,	
retention	and	market	development	against	measurable	objectives.	

- We	will	create	brand	standards	for	our	communication	practices	and	for	marketing	
collateral	used	at	conferences	and	roadshows.	

- We	will	develop	tactics	around	SEO,	newsletters	and	lead	generation	and	implement	
these	as	business	processes.	

	
 	



Roadmap	
	
Phase	1	
MVP	 development	 v1.0 		
Ethereum	blockchain	smart	contracts	are	written	to	control	policy	issuance,	risk	assessment	
and	claim	processing.	A	user	interface	exists	for	the	insuree	to	manage	all	 insured	devices.	
Smart	device-tracking	software	use	cases	are	developed	for	issuing	claims	automatically.	 	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Testnet	
Status:	 This	 work	 is	 completed	 and	 Proof-of-Concept	 apps	 can	 be	 downloaded	 from	
aigang.network/#section-downloadapp.	
	
Phase	2	
MVP	development	v2.0	
Ethereum	blockchain	smart	contracts	are	updated	to	deliver	prediction	market	functionality.	
The	 user	 interface	 allows	 stakeholders	 to	 operate	 the	 prediction	 market,	 access	 data,	
manage	 their	 portfolio	 of	 insurances	 underwritten.	 Back-end	 infrastructure	 is	 created	 for	
off-chain	data	collection	and	calculation.	
	
Early	stage	discussions	with	IoT	device	manufacturers	and	data	suppliers	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Testnet	
Status:	This	is	work	in	progress	and	early	alpha	can	be	accessed	at	platform.aigang.network.		
	
Phase	3	
Beta	version	
Public	 release	 includes	 the	 prediction	 market	 platform	 and	 several	 developed	 insurance	
products.	We	 have	 an	 open	 beta	 version	 of	 the	 platform	 for	 stakeholders,	 underwriters,	
specialists,	 insurance	 enthusiasts	 and	 other	 people	 to	 participate	 in.	 Reinsurance	 is	
integrated,	expanding	the	number	of	fully	autonomous	insurance	products.	A	community	of	
smart	insurance	enthusiasts	is	starting	to	assemble.	
	
Strategic	 agreements	 are	 signed	 with	 IoT	 device	 manufacturers	 and	 data	 suppliers.	
Widespread	publicity	 is	 generated	 around	early	 stage	products	 and	 the	Aigang	platform’s	
use	of	prediction	markets.	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Mainnet	
Status:	Completion	target	is	Q1,	2018	
	
Phase	4	
Release	v1.0	
Stable	and	functioning	prediction	markets	software.	The	development	platform	and	API	are	
being	 used	 by	 module	 developers	 to	 develop	 new	 and	 improved	 insurance	 products.	
Evidence	is	emerging	of	the	performance	benefits	that	diverse,	well-structured	performance	
markets	provide.	
	



Data	 from	 IoT	 devices	 is	 integrated	 and	 used	 in	 insurance	 policy	 applications	 created	 by	
Aigang.	The	first	pre-installed	insurance	contracts	go	live	in	partners’	IoT	devices.	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Mainnet	
Status:	Completion	target	is	Q3,	2018	
	
Phase	5	
Release	v2.0

Status:	Completion	target	is	Q4,	2018	
	
Phase	6	
Release	v3.0	
	
Includes	 a	 complete	 insurance	 OTC	 trading	 platform.	 The	 product	 development	 SDK	 is	
complete	and	in	widespread	use.	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Mainnet	
Status:	Completion	target	is	Q1,	2019	
	
Phase	7	
Release	v4.0	
	
We’ve	created	a	fully	autonomous	insurance	DAO	-	a	platform	for	innovation	and	efficiency.	
Customers	are	accessing	new	and	 improved	 insurance	products.	Some	of	these	have	been	
created	 by	 third-party	 developers,	 others	 by	 Aigang.	 Customers	 are	 using	 our	 permission	
markets	to	hedge	exposure	and	engineer	business	results.	Experts	and	insurance	specialists	
are	 earning	 rewards	 through	 PMs.	Actuarial	 results	 improve.	 Insurers	 are	 using	Aigang	 to	
broaden	the	scope	of	coverage,	increasing	the	size	of	the	insurance	market.	Financiers	and	
backers	 are	 funding	 new	 policies,	 the	 industry	 is	 more	 dynamic	 and	 the	 platform	 is	
flourishing.	
	
Blockchain	environment:	Ethereum	Mainnet	
Status:	Completion	target	is	Q2,	2019	
	
	
Challenges	
	
We	believe	that	Ethereum	is	the	most	appropriate	platform	for	this	project,	and	are	pleased	
with	 progress	made	 to	 date.	We	 are	well	 aware	 that	much	work	 is	 to	 be	 done	 and	 that	
significant	 challenges	exist	across	 the	Ethereum	community	 in	managing	 transaction	costs	
and	the	scalability	of	the	platform.	We	will	be	applying	ourselves	to	this	work.	
	



Other	challenges	include	raising	awareness	of	the	AIX	on	a	limited	marketing	budget	as	well	
as	 finding	 appropriate	 IoT	 and	data-sharing	partners	 and	negotiating	 satisfactory	 financial	
arrangements. 	



Application	of	funds	
	
Blockchain	insurance	protocol	development	–	60%	
	
A	large	part	of	the	budget	will	be	applied	in	four	areas:	
	

- The	creation	of	ongoing	development	of	our	insurance	blockchain	protocol	
- The	 end-user	 experience	 for	 iOS	 and	 Android	 applications	 as	 well	 as	 the	 Aigang	

platform	itself	
- API	integrations	 	
- New	features	

	
	
Security	–	15%	
	
  Implementing	security	for	the	Aigang	network	
	
Principally	 this	will	 involve	 the	 auditing	 of	 smart	 contracts	 governing	 the	 protocol	 and	 its	
interactions	with	off-chain	data	sources	(drones,	smart	devices,	phones,	etc).	
	
	
Operations	and	marketing	–	15%	
	
Additional	staff	and	resources	to	cover	day-to-day	operations	and	prudent	management	as	
the	organization	expands.	This	will	 include	further	development	of	business	processes	and	
the	preemptive	recruitment	of	experienced	operational	management.	
	
	
Legal	and	consulting	-	10%	
	
We	 are	 acutely	 aware	 of	 the	 need	 for	 rigorous	 compliance.	We	will	 need	 our	 own	well-
resourced	 legal	department	and	access	 to	 specialist	 legal	 advice.	Our	principal	 concern	of	
course	 is	 to	 fit	within	complex	 regulatory	 frameworks	across	 the	globe.	 In	 this	 regard,	we	
have	instructed	Asia	Practice	LLC,	a	boutique	corporate	law	firm	in	Singapore,	to	advise	on	
the	Aigang	token	sale.	
	
Percentages	are	estimates	only	and	budgeting	will	be	re-cast	once	fund-raising	is	complete.	
	
	
	
 	



Token	sale	details	
	
10%	 of	 total	 target	 funding	 was	 raised	 at	 pre-sale	 in	 August.		
	
On	15th	November	2017	at	1PM	UTC	Aigang	will	offer	 to	 the	public	51%	of	AIX	 tokens.	A	
further	29%	will	be	allocated	to	creating	a	strong	development	and	data-sharing	community	
actively	contributing	to	the	platform.	Tokens	will	be	ERC20	compatible	and	limited	in	supply.	
No	additional	new	tokens	will	be	created	after	the	token	sale.	
	
	
The	AIX	token		
	
We	 are	 aware	 of	 the	 successful	 and	 increasing	 use	 of	 crowdsourced	 intelligence	 in	 stock	
markets	and	forex	markets.	We	are	applying	that	methodology	to	insurance.	AIX	is	a	utility	
token	which	 entitles	 holders	 to	 participate	 in	 our	 insurance	 prediction	markets.	 Accurate	
predictions	 are	 rewarded	 with	 reputational	 benefits	 as	 well	 as	 additional	 tokens.	 The	
incentives	are	designed	to	ensure	strong,	on-going	demand	for	these	limited-supply	tokens.	
	
Members	will	 receive	Aigang	AIX	 token	 rewards	 in	 return	 for	 telling	 us	whether	 they	 are	
bullish	 or	 bearish	 on	 particular	 insurance	 markets	 or	 products.	 We	 use	 a	 ‘proof-of-
stake’/‘proof-of-reputation’	 algorithm	 based	 on	 token	 ownership	 and	 an	 immutable	
reputation	score	stored	on	the	blockchain.	 It	takes	into	account	the	current	weight	in	the	
prediction	market,	mechanics	of	insurance	pools,	the	user’s	proportion	of	total	AIX	tokens,	
and	their	reputation	score.	
	
As	well	 as	predictions,	 the	AIX	 token	will	 allow	members	 to	 submit	proposals	 for	product	
improvements,	making	PMs	a	tool	for	product	development.	A	vibrant	community	of	smart	
insurance	 enthusiasts	 is	 critical,	 and	 we	 will	 attract	 those	 people	 by	 rewarding	 accurate	
predictions.	
	
The	AIX	tokens	are	non-refundable	functional	utility	tokens,	do	not	in	any	way	represent	any	
shareholding,	 participation,	 right,	 title,	 or	 interest	 in	 Aigang	 or	 any	 other	 company,	
enterprise	or	undertaking,	nor	will	AIX	tokens	entitle	token	holders	to	any	promise	of	fees,		
revenue,	 profits	 or	 investment	 returns,	 and	 are	 not	 intended	 to	 constitute	 securities	 in	
Singapore	 or	 any	 relevant	 jurisdiction.	 AIX	 token	 will	 be	 consumed	 through	 interactions	
between	participants	on	the	platform.

Company	background	
	
We	have	 chosen	 to	 conduct	 the	AIX	 token	 sale	 in	 Singapore	 in	order	 to	demonstrate	our	
commitment	to	stability,	transparency	and	the	rule	of	law.		Singapore	has	a	good	reputation	
as	 an	 international	 marketplace	 with	 excellent	 business	 infrastructure,	 and	 most

Conclusion	
	
We	at	Aigang	believe	that	the	future	of	insurance	will	be	defined	by	blockchain	and	crypto	
technologies,	 helping	 create	 new	 digital	 insurance	 services	 geared	 for	 mobile	 and	 digital	
world.	The	emergence	of	IoT	industry	and	growth	of	smart	devices	will	unlock	a	potential	for	
insurance	services,	and	unlocking	crowd-sourced	intelligence	which	can	help	understand	the	
data	and	apply	new	algorithms	for	risk	and	pricing,	and	thus	can	offer	convenient	and	easy	
to	manage	insurance	products.	This	can	be	achieved	only	by	using	decentralized	blockchain	
platform,	 as	 basis	 for	 creating	 insurance	 protocol,	which	 can	 embed	 in	 any	 device	 in	 the	
world.

journey	and	create	success	story	by	changing	how	insurance	should	work	in	our	new	digital	
age.
