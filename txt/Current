Executive Summary

Blockchain technology allows for a new system of 
transparent accounting that is needed for the 
instant valuation of time, data, and attention. The 
Current protocol aligns the interests of all 
stakeholders in the media consumption cycle to 
create network effects that drive adoption. By 
creating a new medium of exchange, Consumers 
get more choice in how they pay for media; 
Creators and Curators get a new form of com-
pensation, and Advertisers get more transparent 
accounting and audience information. 

The protocol interacts within the Current plat-
form in addition to any other host media network. 
This introduces a new revenue stream and in-
centive mechanism for the host network giving it 
the ability to scale effectively. Over time, dev-
elopers will leverage the identity profiles created 
for future blockchain based systems.

Current is creating a digital token that uniquely 
rewards  a person's time, money spent, and data 
shared during the media streaming experience. 
This token can be used to purchase a broad range 
of products, services, and in-platform advertising.

By consolidating popular media networks into one 
place, Current already provides more than 
200,000 users with a more convenient search and 
discovery experience. With the launch of the 
platform token, users will be rewarded for 
streaming content from their favorite networks 
like: Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, and more..     
The platform combines behavioral data points 
surrounding the types, times, and topics played by 
each person across multiple networks to serve up 
better recommendations than any single network 
alone.

Get paid to stream from networks 
like Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, 
and more in an all-in-one 
personalized experience.

Vision

Attention and personal data are now the most 
important commodities on the internet. 
Media, both serves as an effective place to 
create an attention/data economy and is 
primed for blockchain disruption. By taking a 
passive habit and correlating value to it, 
Current is setting a precedent in today’s 
digital landscape. Users should get more than 
just entertainment, creators should get a 
bigger cut of revenue, and curators should get 
paid for finding the content you didn’t know 
you loved. 

The web we know today was built on the 
personal data and time of the unwitting con-
sumer. Today, just four companies own the 
internet's data.  The next evolution of the 
Web will recognize the value of people and re-
define the value exchange between cons-
umers, and corporations.

When we set out to build this ecosystem, we 
put you in mind: the everyday streamer. We 
considered the variety of media you stream 
and the various networks you have accounts 
on, and built an agile flexible platform that 
adapts to culture quickly. We didn't want you 
to make any sacrifices, so we integrated with 
the most popular networks. You want to con-
trol who your data is shared with and how it’s 
used, so we wrote win-win smart contracts 
that give you choices.

With an estimated buying power of $44 
Billion, Gen Z is spending more than 5 hours 
per day on their phone, making them well 
positioned for cryptocurrency adoption. By 
designing our platform with the most digitally 
active generation in mind, we differentiate 
ourselves from the infrastructural protocols 
developed to serve the “initial wave”  of avid 
users and delivers a valuable new audience to 
the world of blockchain.

Gen Z and Millennials are having deeper and 
more frequent interactions on video and 
music services than ever before. They are 
more likely to search YouTube for a given 
question then to Google it.  Armed with an 
acute awareness, and a strong interest and 
understanding of the digital landscape, these 
groups will represent the first generations 
who will be immersed in blockchain products 
and services. In many cases, Current will be 
the first digital wallet the mainstream public 
will own.

Designed to evolve over time, the Current 
ecosystem is being built in a hybrid fashion, 
with both on-chain and off-chain solutions to 
accommodate shifting market dynamics in the 
blockchain, media and crypto industries. In 
the short-term, the proprietary algorithm will 
create personalized content recommen-
dations across networks in a universal media 
platform. The Current protocol and token will 
introduce new revenue streams and incentive 
mechanisms that will initially be launched 
within the Current platform and later be 
made available for developers to leverage in 
their applications.

The second phase is focused on building a 
protocol and a utility token that democr-
atizes the value created in the media 
consumption cycle; shifting benefits from 
advertisers and intermediaries to people who 
are playing, creating, and curating media. 
Launching initially on the Current platform, 
the protocol will be built to support usage 
within external networks. This offers the host 
network a new incentive mechanism and 
revenue source, as well as a compensation 
model for their users. In turn, the pool of 
token holders is expanded along with the 
value of the ecosystem.

The protocol records transactions on the 
blockchain that attest a user’s contribution to 
the network (by consumption, or by curation 
and creation) and a smart contract distributes 
CRNC tokens in response to that contri-
bution. In order to handle the scalability bot-
tlenecks, while maintaining trust within trans-
actions, we will consider “state channels.” 

During this phase, Current is solely sourcing 
content from third-party networks like 
YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Internet Radio 
etc. ensuring adequate supply of media, to 
accelerate growth and meet user demand. At 
this stage, the goal was to find product-
market fit to establish a strong foundation for 
the product. With over 300 million songs and 
over 1 billion videos, over 200,000 people 
have used Current to listen, watch, and 
interact with media. The average user spends 
over 18 minutes per session and our Day 30 
retention as of Q4 2017 is over 35% without 
any incentives built into the platform, well 
above industry standards at this stage.

As blockchain technology continues to 
mature and adapt to market needs, the token, 
the platform, and the protocol will continue to 
leverage bleeding edge technologies to max-
imize value for all participants. Three such 
strategies include:

In collaboration with independent media 
platforms, the Current protocol will be forked 
to broaden the available market share and 
create sub-tokens for each media ecosystem. 
Each sub-token will have its own distribution 
rules and mechanics that are customized to 
the goals of the media platform. To avoid 
negative impacts on the Current ecosystem, 
the sub-tokens will have individual exchange 
rates related to the core network token and 
internal dynamics that are insulated by the 
inherent nature of the sub token. By creating 
a protocol and ecosystem for media platform 
tokens to exist, Current is able to take a larger 
stake in the streaming of content online, on 
any platform.

The Future Of The Current 
Ecosystem

By aggregating the given identities of a 
user from several networks, Current is in 
a unique position to develop a robust 
preference and identity profile. This 
authentication layer allows any third 
party application to utilize the user’s 
identity attributes and associated data 
without taking ownership of it. 

Using state channels, Current can build 
upon Raiden, specifically with the media 
industry in mind.  Raiden’s launch has 
been delayed due to the fact it's aiming to 
build a universal solution that works in 
several different capacities. We believe 
we could add value to the industry by 
launching a media specific version any 
developer could build upon. 

The platform will provide decentralized 
media infrastructure to host content 
across millions of devices rather than on 
proprietary nodes. Fully decentralized 
media distribution requires significant 
and rapid industry acceptance. 

Without it, consumers are left with a 
limited content library. Current gradually 
leverages blockchain as the general 
public further adopts cryptocurrency and 
the media industry transitions to a more 
decentralized infrastructure. This ap-
proach allows the platform to gain 
momentum and reduce barriers to entry 
on both sides. Creators benefit from an 
established group of token holders within 
the network, and a significantly higher 
portion of revenue. The platform will 
leverage a protocol like IPFS or Storj as a 
directory for data storage and Ethereum 
smart contracts as the distribution logic.

A New Way to 
Play Media

The Current platform provides a more 
convenient and thorough media search and 
discovery process by consolidating disparate 
content sources into one place.  Aside from 
reducing the number of apps needed to play 
music, video, podcasts etc., the platform has 
more data points available about the media 
types, times, and subject matter that a person 
experiences and can generate recommend-
ations better than any single network alone. 
Current is available with 8 integrations and 
intends on integrating more services that host 
podcasts, audio books, television shows, and 
movies.

Unlike conventional content networks like 
YouTube or Spotify, which are limited by the 
content hosted on their platform, Current can 
access the content libraries from multiple 
services through Application Programming 
Interfaces or APIs. An API is a set of routines, 
protocols, and tools that govern the interact-
ion of software components.9

Current integrates with external media 
networks to meet the demand for popular 
media only available on proprietary networks. 
Using third party libraries provides Current 
with an unparalleled agility to add or remove 
libraries as they fluctuate in popularity. 

For instance, live streaming, virtual reality 
and augmented reality will become more 
ubiquitous in the coming years; Current is 
well suited to integrate the most popular 
content networks that serve those types of 
media.

Reducing Barriers to Ownership

One of the strongest attributes of CRNC is its 
accessibility and immediate impact to users.  
Most exchanges and crypto-enabled services 
require a lengthy registration process, some 
form of investment, or hardware for mining. 
Current allows users to start earning CRNC 
tokens immediately without any barriers to 
entry. Another issue that deters new entrants 
into the market is legibility of the application. 
Ripple, Tezos, and many other blockchain 
protocols have very complex solutions that 
require a certain technical literacy and lack a 
broader relatability. 

With our hybrid approach, we’re able to 
garner broad adoption using our existing 
audience and their daily streaming media 
habits through a simple user experience and 
wallet integration, removing all technical 
complexities associated with the adoption of 
cryptocurrencies. Lastly, the other barrier to 
entry revolves around accountability. Many 
token sales are based on theoretical princi-
ples without any sort of product in market. 

The Current Media Platform launched 
the first stage of its product to the 
Apple App Store in Q2 2017. 10



The Current system begins building an 
individual’s preference profile at the start 
of a user’s journey, after they select a 
genre from a predefined list.  By finding 
other content with the same, or similar 
genre, the content filter provides an init-
ial set of recommendations with varying 
degrees of strength. The system funnel 
further analyzes each media item to crea-
te a relationship between one another 
and make recommendations based on 
strong attributes like user plays, saves 
and skips.

Over time and with the addition of profile 
information from third party integrations, 
the preference profile can become more 
robust than a similar model built on any 
single external network.  As new types of 
media are added to Current and users 
interact with a more types of content, our 
preference profile will be in a unique pos-
ition to identify commonalities between 
different types of media, such as,  podcas-
ts to videos, audiobooks and articles and 
so on.

An algorithm can consolidate a seemingly lim-
itless content library into a subset of options 
that users can understand and make choices 
from in moments. In order to make any given 
list of information more manageable, a recom-
mendation system must model users’ prefere-
nces accurately, uncover hidden preferences, 
and avoid redundancy.

Current’s proprietary recommendation algo-
rithm leverages both Content Based Filtering 
and Collaborative Filtering to determine in 
what media users are most interested. Using 
machine learning and neural networks, our 
algorithm will self-amend and change incre-
mentally based on the relational information 
it defines.11

Better Recommendations

A preference in this circumstance is def-
ined as a combination of inputs / actions 
that jointly indicate a greater enjoyment 
of one media item over another or others. 

Media items are defined by their meta-
data: artist name, album name, song 
length, beats per minute, genre type, 
mood type, era of origin and social data 
including likes, follows, comments, and 
shares and other qualities. Types of 
media are broadly represented by var-
ious audio and visual formats including 
music, video, podcasts, posts, articles, 
audio books, TV shows, movies and other 
media yet to be popularized.

Our recommender system is based on 
two filtering methods: Content Based 
Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. 
While Content Based Filtering offers 
recommendations of new tracks similar 
to a user’s past consumption history, 
Collaborative Filtering offers recommen-
dations to a user based on what other, 
similar users listened to. 

Building a Preference Profile 

Proprietary 
Recommendation Algorithm



While Content Based Filtering uses fea-
tures generated from textual metadata 
(genre, category, keywords, embedded 
description words), Collaborative Filter-
ing calculates the correlation between 
the vectors which represent user con-
sumption history. 

To improve efficiency with sparse data, 
the Current algorithm measures the 
cosine similarity between two vectors 
(representing users or tracks). Using a 
matrix of users and tracks the algorithm 
measures the magnitude of a user’s 
perceived value of the media through the 
vectors in a corresponding graph. We 
then analyze the cosine distance between 
two vectors to make recommendations:

The user is the magnitude of a track play, 
where “i” and “j” are two users and this 
formula is applied to a specific track.  The 
smaller the distance between two vec-
tors, the higher the similarity between 
two tracks or users. 

To further improve our recommendation  
accuracy, Current will also employ fea-
tures generated by convolutional neural 
net and autoencoder models in our Con-
tent Based Filtering algorithm.

Recommendation Algorithm Runs Off-Chain



A Utility Token for 
the Media Industry

Tokens will be implemented on the public 
Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. 
With incremental advancements, one of the 
largest developer communities, and top-tier 
backing the Ethereum blockchain has be-
come the industry standard for issuing 
custom digital assets and smart contracts.  
The ERC20 token interface allows for the de-
ployment of a standard token that is com-
patible with the existing infrastructure of the 
Ethereum network (i.e., wallets, dev tools, and 
exchanges.) Although limitations in tran-
saction speed exist, leveraging off-chain 
payment channel networks such as Raiden 
address these bottlenecks.  Advancements 
such as these allow platforms to track micro-
transactions down to the second.

12

The primary objective of the protocol is to 
evolve based on market adoption, and there-
fore will be rolled out incrementally. The 
initial function of the protocol is to reward 
participants of the consumption cycle in three 
steps: (1) verify the initializer; (2) calculate the 
value of the action to the network, and (3) 
calculate the appropriate token reward to 
distribute to the contributors. At the outset, 
Current will have a main initializer that is 
triggered by the consumption of more than 30 
seconds of play (consumption is also referred 
as “mining” within the Current whitepaper). 

Ethereum Based

Purpose of the Protocol

8

Current will stake a portion of CRNC for each 
newly issued platform sub token allowing 
token immediate liquidity to occur for any 
network participations. Sub tokens can then 
be instantaneously traded for CRNC or any 
other token within the ecosystem.

Current will be integrating with the Bancor 
Protocol in order to provide liquidity and 
formulaically determine the price of sub 
tokens. The CRNC token mining pool will 
incentivize large media networks to use and 
implement the Current protocol by aligning 
incentives between host platforms, con-
sumers, creators, and curators. This allows 
the protocol to achieve mass scale and more 
comprehensive datasets around user 
preferences and trends.

Sub Tokens and Network 
Tokens (CRNC)

Current will stake a portion of CRNC for each 
newly issued sub-token allowing token 
immediate liquidity to occur for any network 
participation. Sub-tokens can then be 
instantaneously traded for CRNC or any 
other currency within the Current/Bancor 
ecosystem.

Current creates an easy to use onboarding 
that brings traditional media networks onto 
blockchain technology, adding immediate 
value to their company, while bringing them 
up to date with consumer expectations. By 
creating an eco-system for media, Current is 
able to bring an immediate value to all media 
online and own the landscape of how media 
interactions are rewarded, no matter the 
platform.

At large, cryptocurrency ownership increases 
participation in blockchain enabled products 
and propels advancements throughout the 
industry. Within Current, scaling the user 
base is a key factor in the valuation of CRNC. 
The larger the population of holders, the more 
momentum the technology can gather.  The 
favorable reception of bitcoin in financial 
markets has led to a certain foundational 
strength on which to build upon. Going be-
yond transparency, cryptocurrency allows for 
real-time payments down to the fraction of a 
cent, which offers more control to both the 
subscriber and provider like never before.

The Importance of 
Cryptocurrency Ownership

Current only measures consumption on 
multimedia networks. As of now Current does 
not plan on measuring contribution on plat-
forms such as Facebook or Twitter. Alternate 
initializers will be considered in the future. 
Once the initializer is verified, the contrib-
ution is attributed to the appropriate partici-
pants (see page 13 - Token Value Flow).



Token and Protocol

Current’s blockchain attribution protocol ac-
curately and transparently compensates con-
tributions to the recommendation algorithm 
and overall growth of the Current ecosystem. 
A token is “mined” when a user plays media 
within the platform. Each token that is mined 
is split amongst the the creator, curator, con-
sumer and potential referrer.

In order to ensure liquidity and supply, the 
Block Reward (Br) calculation maintains a ratio 
of available supply to demand. Each block is 
eq-ual to 3600 seconds or one hour of con-
sumption (mining) done by a consumer. With 
every 100,000,000 blocks mined, the block 
reward changes in proportion with the 
number of tokens left in the system. This is 
known as a Block Cycle (Bc).

Variables

Br = Block Reward
Tp = Token Pool 
To = Token’s Out  (During a single block cycle) 
Cp = Growth Pool (During a single block cycle)

Not all user consumption is equal. The 
Contribution Coefficient (H) is designed to 
disincentivize illegitimate plays, and to ident-
ify the most influential contributors to its net-
work. It is calculated with data points from 
the Current platform via a centralized oracle 
operated by the Current Corporation, then 
injected into the blockchain.

Contribution Coefficient (H)

There are many reasons to discourage 
long, continuous mining. Firstly, adver-
tising research suggests that ad fatigue 
decreases attention; secondly, we want 
to discourage consumer fraud where 
users “play” media without authentically 
paying attention to it. We define a “ses-
sion” as a time period of continuous min-
ing with some minimum time apart from 
the next session. We designed a coeffi-
cient function in which marginal reward 
tapers off as session length increases. The 
cumulative award then is naturally its 
integral.

The play legitimacy likelihood is a coeffi-
cient designed to prevent inauthentic 
plays from mining CRNC. This coefficient 
will be regularized so that it is consistent 
across the network in the majority of 
cases and 0 (zero) for identified frauds on 
a by-user basis. Our proprietary algor-
ithm solves an anomaly detection prob-
lem based on features generated from 
Current platform usage, like app foregr-
ound consumption, advertisement inter-
action, and session velocity and length.

This algorithm is computationally expen-
sive, and presently the required data 
points are located off-chain. For these 
reasons, our anti-fraud checks will be 
performed by the off-chain Current API. 
We’ll consider moving these checks on-
chain once more of our data moves on-
chain, and if on-chain transaction costs 
fall to an affordable rate.

Similar to verifying play legitimacy, this

large transactions cost if performed on-

these calculations will be conducted in an 
off-chain API.

The diagram below represents the baseline distribution structure of tokens mined through media 
consumption. For some media items consumed, the distribution may vary based on the presence or 
absence of a referrer or curator.

For consumers this is 55%, creators and curators this is 20%, for referrers this is up to 3%, and for the growth pool this is 
2%. *When content is consumed and a 3rd party curator is not present, Current is awarded the 20%. **While a creator

Key Takeaways

Current will initially provide a proto-
col and token that can be used within 
the Current platform and ultimately 
on external media partners. Current 
brings value to all players in the media 
consumption cycle.



Earning and 
Spending Tokens

The main way to accumulate platform tokens 
is by playing media within the Current 
platform. As the platform increases its 
reliance on blockchain technologies, stake-
holders are impacted differently.

The amount of tokens earned by the user is 
reliant on their contribution coefficient and 
the number of referrals they've made suc-
cessfully. All users who consume media on 
Current from any of our content integrations 
will be awarded platform tokens.

Tokens Earned by Consumers

A user’s ‘mine rate’ is impacted by the 
amount of data that is tied to their 
account.  They can increase this rate by 
syncing third-party profiles. This incent-
ive increases user inputs and allows the 
recommendation algorithm to provide 
more personalized content. As the Cur-
rent network grows, more value is 
created and a more robust recommend-
ation platform with exponentially greater 
content integrations will emerge for 
users.

A user may invite others to Current and 
earn up to (3%) of their distribution value 
of tokens each new user earns in per-
petuity. Current may implement a split of 
the 3% where both the referrer and the 
referee each get a (1.5%) share of the 
tokens the new user earns. 

Example: Tom joined Current on his own. 
Tom Invites Steve and then Steve invites 
Jerry.
 
Tom = 55% of his TR (Token reward) + 
1.5% of Steve's TR

Steve = 55% of his TR  + 1.5% bonus of his 
own TR + 1.5% of Jerry’s TR

Jerry = 55%  of his TR + 1.5% bonus of his 
own TR

New users will be shown ads until they 
have 5 tokens in their wallet (or the 
equivalent of the lifetime value of a free 
user within Current).  Ads will reappear if 
the user’s balance drops below this 
threshold. Users do not need to trade in 
tokens to eliminate ads post-threshold. If 
a user chooses to keep ads activated, this 
will positively affect their con-tribution 
coefficient, effectively allowing them to 
mine tokens faster.

Earning and Spending CRNC

Within Current, users are able and encourag-
ed to curate multiple media streams into 
Channels. These channels act as “folders” of 
content from multiple media networks. 
Current will reward users who curate popular 
channels within the network by measuring 
the amount of time spent on their curated 
media. 

The curators get a 20% share of tokens based 
on the consumption of their channels and 
playlists. Since consumption is the primary 
method of measurement for their reward, the 
contribution coefficient of the users that the 
curators curate for determines how many 
tokens the curator will earn per session. 
 

An escrow account is created once a creator 
has accumulated 36,000 seconds (10 hours) 
of streaming, until then the tokens associated 
with these smaller creators will go towards 
the growth pool. If creators do not claim their 
wallets within 12 months, a 10% monthly 
decay rate is imposed.  This time limit motiv-
ates creators to join sooner and also safe-
guards the platform from having too many 
tokens out of circulation.  All decayed tokens 
will ultimately go back to the token pool via 
the growth pool.

Once on Current, creators will continue to 
upload their content to their platform(s) of 
choice (Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.) 
and a user would then consume that content 
via the Current platform. The creator will get 
paid their usual license fees from the integra-
ted platform (ex. Spotify or Youtube) in addi-
tion to getting a 20% allocation of the earned 
tokens from Current. As the platform further 
integrates decentralized storage, Creators 
can earn 100% of their revenue when paid in 
tokens. 

With these mechanisms, users can better 
support their favorite creators by consuming 
on Current and helping them earn more for 
their work.  

At present, the Current platform provides 
content through a series of content integra-
tions. Together, these integrations provide 
Current users with an unprecedented catalog 
of media.  In early 2019, Current will allow for 
the direct upload of content to its net-work 
and will distribute that content in a 
decentralized manner.

To strategically bring creators onto the 
platform, Current will be allocating 20% of 
each earned token to the creators of the 
media consumed within Current regardless of 
the media item’s source network. All earnings 
are held in escrow until the creator joins the 
network and claims their wallet.

Tokens can be used as a cash substitute 
within the Current app for digital and physical 
goods.  

Tokens Spent on Current

Users can use tokens to pay for premium 
services on Current. Such services may 
include offline listening, Ad-free stream-
ing, exclusive uploaded content, and 
memberships to premium networks with 
which Current integrates. 

Tokens can be sent to other users within 
the platform. As our platform expands 
users will also be able to use tokens to 
buy tickets, physical goods, and other 
services. 

Tokens will be the primary currency 
within Current. Advertisers seeking 
direct relationships with Current will 
need to acquire tokens in order to 
promote campaigns within the Current 
network.

Key Takeaways

Tokens are split amongst participants 
to seed the platform with a useful 
cryptocurrency that initially serves to 
reduce subscription costs for con-
sumers and ultimately to support 
creators who upload their content to 
Current.

As the platform grows it's reasonable to 
say tens of millions if not more users will 
be holders of CRNC and its subtokens. 
The Current Network will provide 
support to enable other applications to 
use tokens for goods outside of the 
Current platform.

Economics and 
Network Dynamics

The Current token economy is based on the 
number of users playing media in the Current 
network and their contributions to the net-
work. The network has several stabilization 
tactics that help balance token outflows and 
inflows within the network.

Economics teaches us that value is sub-
jective. Economic value for an item is created 
because people desire that item for one 
reason or another. 

As Bitcoin came into existence in 2009 and 
adoption spread, the value of the virtual 
currency skyrocketed. In 2016, Dutch econ-
omists Von Oordt and Bolt published a model 
to analyze virtual currency exchange rates 
and what factors led to value creation. They 
found that three components are important: 

The existing use of virtual currency to 
make payments

Forward-looking investors buying the 
virtual currency; effectively regulating 
its supply

The factors that together will drive 
future consumer adoption and merch-
ant acceptance of virtual currency.

1.

2.

3.

The basis of their theory came from 
economist Irving Fisher’s observation from 
1911,   that speculators may effectively limit 
the money supply by withdrawing money 
from circulation in anticipation of higher fu-
ture utility. 

Limited issuance currencies such as Current’s 
digital tokens and Bitcoin fall into this 
category. When initially pricing the token sale 
and creating the foundational layer behind 
the network’s ecosystem, these factors were 
taken into consideration.

14

Token Stability and Value 
Creation

Limit the total supply of tokens to 
1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) tokens

To eliminate the need for issuance of 
future tokens, we’ll create a user 
growth pool by taking a percentage of 
each token earned. The growth pool 
tokens gets put back into the miners 
reward pool after each block cycle

Reward users for their contribution 
while accounting for difficulty via

ption, time, attention, referrals, user

The Current Growth Pool is always awarded 
2% of every token mined within the system. 
This will ensure that the token reward pool 
never goes to zero and make future token 
releases unnecessary. In addition to this built-
in distribution mechanism, the Growth Pool 
also receives token inflows from inactive 
accounts.

A 10% monthly decay rate begins after 6 
months of neglect, at which point tokens are 
directed back into the Current Growth Pool 
via the smart contract. This continues until 
the use of the Current Media Platform 
resumes (a valid 30 second play or more). 
Users will be notified of this when they join 
and repeatedly before the 6 month mark. 
Similarly, a 10% monthly decay rate will be 
imposed for creators who do not claim their 
escrow tokens within 12 months of being 
awarded them. This is done to ensure tokens 
are not lost within the platform by users who 
abandon. If a user decides to store his tokens 
on a third party or offline wallet no decay rate 
will be imposed.

Users may invite their friends in which case 
they will earn more tokens for contributing 
new users to the network. Our mission is to 
make sure everyone can participate and get 
tokens early, even if they have never pur-
chased virtual currency before.

We envision five main ways of creating value 
and a sustainable ecosystem for CRNC: 

Scaling the user base is a key factor in the 
valuation of the token. As such, Current will 
allocate a minimum of 10,000,000 (10 Million) 
tokens for distribution to early users for 
simply claiming their wallet within the 
Current platform. The amount will be relative 
to the cost of acquiring those users through 
traditional channels and will not be designed 
for wealth creation. This incentivizes early 
participation in the network from people 
outside of the cryptocurrency field of interest.

Automatic Wallet Creation

The Current token creates a dynamic sub-
scription model for streaming: one which, by 
allowing users the choice of toggling ads and 
subscribing to premium services, efficiently 
captures consumers’ willingness to pay for 
premium serv-ices against viewing ads.  

Evidence from the financials of two streaming 
services, Spotify and Pandora, show that 
consumers brings 30% - 40% higher revenue 
on a subscription over an advertising model   
(see Appendix #1 for a comparative analysis). 
Yet the subscription segment across almost 
all services is smaller than that for free-tier 
users. 

In addition, the standard binary “advertising 
or subscription” model does not efficiently 
capture different consumer demand elastic-
ities: especially those who value an ad-free 
experience, but do not necessarily consume 
enough to warrant a full-priced subscription.

As part of this process, Current will open 
source the protocols and several components 
of the media platform to the general public. 
This allows our community of developers to 
build and expand the network and, ulti-
mately, the holders of Current tokens. This 
transition is a statement of our dedication to 
our community and encouraging an en-
vironment where all participants benefit from 
its success. 

Today, the biggest issue facing blockchain 
companies doing token sales is the lack of 
transparency to the public. It puts all block-
chain based projects at risk, thus Current will 
be implementing a core initiative we share 
with many amazing companies “Default To 
Transparency,”   where our community is 
provided with the information they deserve. 

Starting in Q4 of 2018, we will send quarterly 
reports to all backers because we believe 
token sales should operate in a transparent 
manner. A lack of transparency can create a 
lack of trust. In addition, we felt it would be 
imperative to add additional governance 
mechanisms into the Current ecosystem that 
facilitates the growth of the platform 
alongside community supported development 
and greater good objectives. 

From the onset, Current will reserve 3% of 
the token pool for the creation of the Current 
Foundation. In the beginning, Current will 
serve on the Foundation's board of advisors. 
Over time, we will move towards the inclusion 
of key community members to aid in the 
oversight of the Current Foundation’s goals of 
long-term network governance, long-term 
support of token holder interests, transition 
to an open-sourced and decentralized 
platform, partner programs, greater good 
programs, and academic grants that include 
investments in technologies that benefit the 
ecosystem.

Key Takeaways

The Current economy has been de-

bad actors from the community.



Market 
Landscape

Most of the blockchain-enabled media 
companies are focused on areas such as copy-
r i g h t a t t r i b u t i o n a n d d e c e n t r a l i z e d 
distribution. Only a few of them are focused 
on incentivizing social media and advertising. 
Our analysis of the market landscape located 
several media-related tokens and revealed 
trends that have influenced our commitment 
and vision.

24

Incentivized Social Media & 
Advertising Landscape

This market segment ecompasses a cross 
section of incumbents pairing a daily habit 
with a simplified user experience that aims to 
remove the common barriers and technical 
complexities associated with the mainstream 
adoption of existing blockchain enabled 
products. 

Kik’s successful experiment using a non-
blockchain digital currency within their 
messaging platform validated that a de-
centralized currency could also take hold. 
After its implementation, the monthly 
transaction volume hit nearly three times 
the global transaction volume of Bitcoin,  
their users proved their ability to quickly 
adopt and use the currency.

The Kin token will be used to reward 
users for their contributions to the 
ecosystem. As an established platform 
with millions of users, Kik will benefit 
from fast and broad adoption of Kin. 

Brendan Eich, the founder of Javascript 
and co-creator of Mozilla, created the 
Basic Attention Token (BAT) to facilitate 
value exchange in the Brave Internet 
Browser’s digital advertising market-
place. Brave is an open-sourced, privacy-
focused internet browser that blocks 
malvertising and ad-trackers while 
accurately rewarding publishers and 
advertisers through smart contracts on 
the blockchain.    While capitalizing on the 
security and privacy conscious desktop 
internet user, they’ve also grown a 
modest user base of blockchain early 
adopters from the momentum of their 
successful ICO which raised $35M. 
Similar in the way that BAT commod-
itizes and rewards for “user attention” 
using web and publisher content, Current 
is directly applying to multimedia con-
sumption.

Kin, much like Current’s token, will be 
used to reward creators, access premium 
content, and pay for goods and services 
within the ecosystem. While in a different 
market segment from Current, Kik has 
proven that a the 13-24 year old demo-
graphic has a strong willingness to adopt 
a digital currency with low barriers to 
entry.

Steem is an incentivized social media 
platform, which is similar to Reddit and 
uses the its own blockchain and pro-
prietary tokens to reward and moderate 
discussion. ,,Their platform has seen 
considerable growth within their core 
demographic of cryptocurrency enthu-
siasts and early adopters from the pro-
liferation of interest in digital currencies 
and blockchain technology. Steem’s 
community reward system is similar to 
Current’s; however, their reward system 
requires input from users - reading con-
tent, voting, and commenting. Current’s 
users earn tokens merely from their con-
sumption patterns within the platform.

Decentralized Media Platforms

Current is not impeded by rights attribution, a 
limited population of cryptocurrency holders, 
or a limited content library. There’s never a 
shortage of cryptocurrency holders on the 
C u r r e n t p l a t f o r m b e c a u s e a l l u s e r s 
immediately earn CRNC by streaming media. 
The content library and rights attribution 
issues are handled by our external media 
partners. 

Blockchain technology is poised to be as 
disruptive to the Media Industry as digital 
recordings and the internet have been. 
Decentralized computing, and the distrib-
ution models enabled by it, level the playing 
field so newcomers and established creators 
can both thrive. Broader audiences and more 
transparent payments top the list of benefits 
to creators and consumers. However, new 
decentralized platforms, like Ujo, Opus, JAAK 
and SingularDTV face issues like industry 
lobbying, adoption rates, prior crypto-
currency holdings, limited content libraries 
and technical hurdles.

Key Takeaways

User attention is being commoditized 
across several mediums including 
messaging, web browsing, and media 
production.  Platforms, like Kik, have 
validated the adoption of a digital 
currency within the 13-24 year old 
market; Current aims to penetrate 
that market from a media streaming 
standpoint.

Privacy and Security

In the Current Media Platform, users have 
read-only access to the amount of tokens 
they’ve earned from their contributions. 
Within the platform, users will be supplied 
with an encrypted key that changes every 20 
seconds. Users will then use this as one of 
their signatures as part of a two-factor 
authentication apart of the CRNC wallet that 
will be stored separately from the app itself. 
The wallet is being designed with anonymity 
and security in mind. 

While the user experience will be seamless, 
this encryption adds another layer of ad-
ditional security, however, no matter how 
secure an online wallet or exchange is, pos-
sible security vulnerabilities inherently exist,  
e.g., human error. With the growth of Alt-
coins and token sales, we noticed very few 
options exist to store these coins offline. 
Current is exploring the possibility of 
providing the offline hardware needed for 
token holders who meet a predefined thresh-
old for safer keeping. 

We realize that some users may be skeptical 
of our usage of the data collected based on 
past experiences with other software or-
ganizations. Like many market leaders, 
Current puts the user at the helm and gives 
control with opt-in, opt-out features. 

Users can choose whether or not to con-
tribute to the algorithm and earn token re-
wards at a faster rate. Users decide what to 
share with the network and adjust their 
privacy settings accordingly, with most per-
sonally identifiable pieces of information 
decoupled from preference data. Current is 
dedicated to the security and privacy of our 
community members and will be keeping all 
private data on the user’s device.

The Current ledger system intends to explore 
the implementation of the ANONIZE  algo-
rithm amongst other measures to further 
protect user privacy. Current will continue to 
make this a top priority as the platform e-
volves. 

Current will use the Ethereum MultiSig wallet 
as our standard. CRNC will be fully compliant 
with ERC20 standards in order to ensure that 
the tokens are compatible with all Ethereum-
based wallets (Mist, Geth, Metamask).

Frequently Asked
Questions

Current will utilize the bene-
fits of a blockchain across two 
phases, first, enabling Current 
to record user contributions 
to the platform and reward 
them for their time, attention, 
and consumption. This will 
continually evolve towards 
using the blockchain to aid in 
the decentralization and tran-
sparent distribution of con-
tent, payments, goods and 
services. 

The Ethereum network was 
chosen because it is one of the 
most robust blockchain plat-
form built for application inte-
gration along with the largest 
development comm-unity 
behind it. 

The Ethereum foundation's 
dedication to continually de-
velop and improve the under-
lying technology to improve 
scaling issues make Ethereum 
one of the most compelling 
blockchain platforms to build 
on top of. Our team has 
closely been monitoring the 
progress of Raiden and how 
we can use state channels to 
solve the scalability issues we 
would be facing within Cur-
rent.

Also, with the average session 
duration in the Current app 
being an average of 18 min-
utes and continually increas-
ing, these integrations can 
expect to see longer time 
spent on their respective net-
works and a better experience 
for their users.
 
Our mission is not to canni-
balize our partner networks, in 
fact we want our users to use 
tokens for premium sub-
scriptions within these net-
works. This further benefits 
these networks and the broad 
industry as a whole, turning 
free users into paying users. It 
is important to note, that our 
goal is to continue to add 
content integrations as time 
goes on, further decreasing 
the impact of any one inte-
gration dropping from the 
Current platform. 

During final phase of the plat-
form, the Current platform 
will have reached the critical 
mass of users it needs to make 
full use of our de-centralized 
media integration that would 
co-exist alongside the most 
popular third party networks.

Current launched stage one of  
platform at the end of March 
2017 with a mix of eight public 
and private inte-grations, a 
good portion of which we’ve 
secured through direct par-
tnerships. All our integrated 
partners are ben-efited as 
they retain all the user in-
teractions, data, and revenue 
from plays within Current, ie. a 
play on Spotify still counts for 
a play on Spotify and they get 
paid on that stream. 

Why does Current need to 
use the blockchain to 
accomplish its goals? 

Why did Current choose 
Ethereum over another 
blockchain?

Is the Current platform 
reliant solely on third 
party API integrations?

Frequently Asked Questions

When new integrations are 
added, especially of a new 
media type (like film for inst-
ance), the available pool of rel-
evant information grows and 
therefore increases the brea-
dth of our recommendations. 
We can catalogue and display 
more content and therefore 
keep users engaged longer. 
This will in turn impact the 
contribution coefficient assoc-
iated with each user and the 
network as whole.

Tokens purchased through the 
token sale or earned from 
their participation in the plat-
form through media con-
sumption will be able to ope-
nly trade their CRNC on par-
ticipating exchanges. 

The total supply of CRNC will 
be limited at 1 billion tokens, 
and we will never issue new 
tokens after the token sale. 
During the token sale, 35% of 
all of the tokens will be avail-
able for purchase, and the 
remainder will be earned 
through a user's contribution 
by consuming media. The rate 
at which the user is able to 
earn these tokens is depend-
ent on a variety of factors 
outlined in the Token Dyn-
amics and Protocol section.

Users are able to redeem their 
CRNC for premium subscript-
ions to our media partners, 
such as Spotify. The user 
would select which service 
they would like to redeem 
their CRNC for and we would 
provide a key to upgrade their 
service on that network. 

The CRNC tokens won’t leave 
a user's wallet on the eco-
system until they’ve been sent 
to a wallet on a partici-pating 
secondary exchange, or are 
placed in a participating or 
proprietary offline wallet. 

In the future, beyond phase 2, 
tokens will be able to be spent 
directly on other platforms for 
premium services, content and 
other goods. That said, once 
the Current Ad Platform goes 
live, these external services 
can use their accumulated 
CRNC on targeting display ad-
vertising within the Current 
Platform. 

How does Current’s 
protocol account for new 
integrations into the 
platform?

What is the total supply of 
CRNC? Will Current ever 
issue more? 

How are CRNC tokens 
leaving Current’s platform?

How are CRNC tokens 
redeemed in the platform?

Frequently Asked Questions Cont. 2

How do I set up my wallet 
on Current? 

Why is there a decay rate 
on CRNC tokens held in my 
wallet?

Where can I learn more 
about Current and CRNC?

Once the CRNC wallets go 
live, interested parties will be 
directed to a portal where you 
will be asked to claim and 
generate your wallet. Once 
the wallet has been generated, 
you will be provided with a 
seed phrase tied to that 
specific wallet address. This is 
something you’ll keep for your 
records. Once that seed has 
been generated, you’ll be 
asked to enter a password. 
After this process has been 
completed, we will reward 
that address with a pre-
determined amount of CRNC 
tokens for doing so. 

With your new wallet gen-
erated, you’ll be able to make 
referrals to your friends to 
earn additional tokens. 

In order to incentivize active 
users on the platform, any 
CRNC tokens held in an 
account that goes inactive for 
more than 6 months will begin 
to decay; the decaying tokens 
will then be transferred back 
into the growth pool to 
reward active participants.

A user will get a series of 
alerts before this takes place. 
The decay rate does not apply 
to any tokens purchased 
during the token sale, or 
tokens transferred out and 
held in an offline wallet.

The rates of decay at associate 
intervals are as follows:  

6 months @ 10%

Appendix 1: Comparative 
Analysis and Token Dynamics

As Spotify isn’t publicly traded, we rely here 
on news reports of Spotify’s financials . 
reported to its Luxembourg parent.

Spotify ended 2016 with 126 million monthly 
active users, with 78 million (62%) free-tier 
users and 48 million (38%) paid subscriptions. 
However, 89.9% of its revenue, 2.64bn Eur., is 
driven by paid subscriptions. Due to cost of 
revenues, the gross profit on premium 
subscriptions was €483.8m, while Spotify’s 
ad-supported business recorded a gross loss 
of €33.3m.

We assume that cost of revenue is driven by 
streaming royalties to record labels, PROs, 
back-office services, and publishers, approx-
imated on a per-play basis. We use a EUR-
USD conversion rate of 1:1.2.

21

We assume the average play generates 
$0.006 in royalties (industry eCPM):

Assuming that consumer valuations for 
Spotify Premium are solely driven by the 
avoidance of ads (aside from other benefits, 
for instance mobile app usage or higher audio 
quality):

Thus we estimate that Spotify Premium users 
overvalue each stream around 35% as 
compared to free tier users

40

Spotify

Total Cost of Revenue

Estimated Cost of Revenue per User 
per Year:

Number of plays per average user 
per year: 

Number of plays per average user 
per year: 

Premium: 2,640 - 483.8 =  €2,156m
Free: 295 - (-33.3) =  €328.3m



Pandora, in contrast with streaming music 
providers like Spotify and Current, acts as an 
internet radio provider -- which means its 
royalty and distribution model is somewhat 
different, and we track listener time, rather 
than number of legitimate plays. These figures 
are quoted from its financial statements: the 
2016 10-K and 2016 Q3 10-Q.

Like Spotify, there are more Pandora 
subscribers than there are free-tier. There 
were 74.5M free-tier users, and 4.39M 
subscribers in 2016. Its subscription-based 
service logged 2.79B total listener hours, as 
compared to 19.17B on the free advertising 
tier.

We use the RPM metric (revenue per 
thousand listening-hours) provided on the 
Pandora 10-K (only the first nine months are 
included, because the RPM metric is 
abandoned after Q3 2016):

22

Why do users pay more for subscriptions to 
get rid of ads?

Why are there always more free-tier users 
than subscribers?

By comparison - 80.98/58.10 - we arrive at an 
estimate of roughly a 39.4% increase in 
revenue per l istening hour with the 
subscription viz. An advertising model.  Keep 
in mind that Current’s RPM is slightly 
different than Pandora’s RPM in the sense 
that we have an enforced 30-sec minimum 
per track when counting listener time.

Mental accounting. Individuals often 
assign expenditures to specific ac-
counts, and constrain their spending 
differently across accounts in ways 
that often violate the economic prin-
ciple of fungibility.    Instead of viewing 
ads, which is a constantly salient ex-
penditure of “attention,” users may file 
streaming subscription renewal fees 
under a “utilities” bucket, a decision 
frame in which expenditure “matters 
less.”

Salience. Advertising is a continuous 
demand on attention, whereas a mon-
thly fee is a less salient, one-off expen-
diture.

Consumers view free prices more 
highly irrespective of cost-benefit dif-
ference.  By being free to use, Cur-
rent leverages the “free” effect to 
make everyone subscribers.

Frictions for payment, like credit card 
validation and service fees, exist for 
currency transactions. Using CRNC 
tokens removes the frictions of small 
payments.

We calculate a rough projection for hours of 
play each day on the Current network by 
approximating an exponential growth rate, 
using figures from internal projections. We 
start with a rough projection for total hours of 
play by all users each day at 180 hours, high 
exponential growth in the first two months, 
and 25% per month for the first year. The 
block reward decreases over time linearly as 
more tokens are mined. We estimate the 
change of block reward using the block re-
ward equation, and assuming that the growth 
pool stays at 4% of mined tokens. 

As total blocks mined increases exponentially 
over time, block reward per hour of streaming 
decreases exponentially:

Afterwards, we estimate the token reward 
per listener hour. Using our Spotify average 
play revenue estimates from page 38 (an 
eCPM of $0.006/legitimate play), and minute 
length (3 minutes) and average contribution 
coefficient (0.5), we estimate the average 
token reward per hour the average listener 
listens.

We use our Spotify estimate of revenue per 
hour of legitimate plays ($0.12) divided by 
average token award (0.25) to arrive at a 
starting price estimate of $0.48 per token. As 
one token roughly represents how much 
economic value one hour of listening brings, 
so we estimate the price of a token given that 
it equals the revenue brought by its equiv-
alent in Spotify listener time:

Given that the average price of a Spotify 
subscription is $5.78,  we estimate that the 
number of legitimate listening hours for a 
consumer to earn back a subscription is 43.7 
hours.

Given that the average price of a Spotify 
subscription is $5.78,  we estimate that the 
number of legitimate listening hours for a 
consumer to earn back a subscription is 43.7 
hours.

Appendix 2:
Decentralized Media

It is cost prohibitive to store large amounts of 
data on the Ethereum blockchain. The 
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) makes it 
possible to do so while maintaining a 
decentralized network. IPFS is a peer-to-peer 
distributed file system that connects all 
computing devices with the same system of 
files. The files are addressed by the hash of 
their content as opposed to a centrally-
controlled location. The diagram below shows 
how nodes access data with IPFS vs the de 
facto HTTP protocol.  

IPFS will serve as the data storage layer of the 
Current platform. Current will offer users 
CRNC as an incentive to provide storage of 
uploaded files on the network powered by 
IPFS. If needed, Current may implement 
additional storage measures via services like 
Filecoin  or IPFSstore  where a negligible  
tariff per media item sold would be imposed 
on the creator and paid to whomever is 
hosting the content for the network on the 
aforementioned services.

In order for the system to operate, Current 
must also implement a logic layer, done via 
Ethereum smart contracts. The contracts 
provide creators with the appropriate pay-
ments for their content in a fair and trans-
parent way.  To control access to IPFS-hosted 
content, we employ an asymmetric en-
cryption mechanism. All files uploaded to the 
Current IPFS network are first encrypted by 
the Current Foundation's public key. This can 
be performed in the iOS application, and 
avoids any single point of failure.

26 27

When a user wants to download a track, the 
IPFS address hash is sent to the Current API 
which will load the file from the IPFS network, 
decrypt it using the Current Foundation's 
private key. The track will then be re-
encrypted using the user's public key, and 
then provided to the user.

This final step presently requires interaction 
with our centralized API. While we have 
focused on building a stable, redundant sys-
tem we recognize that this presents a possible 
single point of failure in the network. Before 
this phase of the platform is implemented (est. 
Q1, 2019), we expect to see advancements in 
the IPFS platform to allow for more fine-
grained access controls to be included in the 
filesystem. This would allow us to employ a 
fully-decentralized content distribution sys-
tem.

43

Centralized vs. Decetralized 
Computing Model

A centralized architecture represents a multiple client 
to single server model where the server computer is 
the one where all of the major processing or storage is 
done. A decentralized architecture allows for pro-
cessing to be distributed among multiple computeing 
nodes with no single server machine solely responsible 
for all the processing.
