Introduction 
 

ChainTrade is the first blockchain-based platform for the trading of futures and options on food and raw 

materials (aka commodity derivatives). We aim to revolutionize a global market representing more than 

2 trillion USD of trade per annum, by providing a decentralized platform that will be open to all, allowing 

small and big players to take part in the trade.  

By utilizing blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and Smart Contracts (as defined below), 

ChainTrade’s lean and efficient platform will dramatically lower the fees in comparison to the existing 

commodity exchanges, making it easier and more profitable for all stakeholders to trade derivatives on 

food and raw materials. All traders worldwide will have equal access to the platform – no special 

advantages such as co-located servers or better fees for the biggest players.  

ChainTrade will provide standard and well-defined processes that will make payments, clearing and 

settlement processes more efficient, leading to cost and fees reductions and increasing traders’ profits. 

KYC and AML processes will be made more efficient thanks to artificial intelligence / machine learning. 

Although ChainTrade is first and foremost a financial project with expectations of high profitability, our 

mission is also to contribute to more equal access of the world resources.  

With a world population set to reach 9.8 billion people by 2050, while farming lands do not expand and 

more and more mines are depleted, food and raw material resources are likely to become more and 

more limited. In addition, fair trade and fair access to food and raw materials is not guaranteed today, as 

demonstrated in the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis, when purchases made by major investors led 

to soaring food and raw materials prices.  

Even though government authorities in the US and the EU have launched initiatives to tackle this 

problem, the issue of unfair access to food and raw materials still exists due to the centralization of 

commodity exchanges and the barriers for traders to access them equally. 

Thanks to the blockchain technology allowing decentralization and distributed ledgers, ChainTrade 

wants to contribute to the solution by allowing anyone to buy and sell those fundamental products, 

irrespective of their country or wealth.

1. Fundamentals on Exchanges of Food and Raw Materials 

1.1 What is an option? 

An option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a 

security or some other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the “Strike Price”) during a certain 

period or on a specific date (the “Exercise Date”). 

Options can be call options or put options. 

Call Options gives the option to buy at a certain price, so a buyer who anticipates that the underlying 

security will rise, buys the option with the hope of selling the security for a higher price. However, if the 

market price falls, the buyer is not obligated to buy the option at the Exercise Date. He will, however, 

lose the amount paid for the option. 

Put Options give the buyer the option to sell the underlying security at a certain price. If the market 

price falls below the Strike Price as expected, the buyer can decide to exercise his or her right to sell at 

that price and the writer of the option contract has the obligation to buy the security at the Strike Price. 

If the buyer exercises the put, he makes a profit which is the difference between the sales of the option 

to the put writer and the cost of the security in the market. 

1.2 What is a Future? 

Futures, also called futures contracts are financial contracts that give the buyer an obligation to 

purchase an asset, and the seller the obligation to sell the asset at a given price, at a future point in 

time. The point in time could be weeks, months, or years. 

 

The items that are often traded in futures contracts are commodities like raw materials, grains, precious 

metals, oil, and natural gas. Other items like stocks and bonds are also traded in futures contracts. 

 

Futures contracts are standardized, meaning that standard specifications are used for the underlying 

commodity’s quality, quantity, and delivery so that the prices mean the same thing to all participants in 

the market. 

Buyers and sellers use commodity futures contracts to lock in the purchase of sale prices weeks, months 

or years in advance. For example, assume that a farmer is expecting to produce 100,000 bushels of 

soybeans in 12 months. Typically, soybeans futures contracts include the quantity of 5,000 bushels.  

If the farmer's break-even point on a bushel of soybeans is $10 per bushel and he sees that one-year 

futures contracts for soybeans are currently priced at $15 per bushel, it will be wise for him to lock in 

the $15 sales price per bushel by selling enough one-year soybean contracts to cover his harvest. In this 

example, that is (100,000 / 5,000 = 20 contracts).  

Commodity futures and options contracts allow farmers and raw materials producers, as well as 

industrial buyers, to hedge their risks. Those contracts are traded on commodity exchanges.

1.3 What is a Commodity Exchange? 

According to J.F. Pyle, “Commodity exchanges are specialized organized markets which provide a place 

where their members buy and sell commodities or contract for future delivery under established rules 

and regulations.” 

It can also be defined as a public organization consisting of buyers, sellers, producers, traders, and 

dealers dealing in one or more commodities which constitute the articles of trade in the market.  

The commodities which are generally traded in at the commodity exchanges include the following: 

▪ Natural produce of the soil like soybeans, corn, wheat, tea, etc. 

▪ Mineral products like gold, lead, copper, oil, etc. 

▪ Manufactured products like hides, artificial jam, etc. 

1.4 Functions of a Commodity Exchange 

Commodity exchanges are generally utilized for wholesale dealings in agricultural commodities or the 

products of some important primary industries like lumbering. 

These exchanges perform the following important functions: 

a) Providing a Market Place 

A commodity exchange provides a convenient place where the members can meet at fixed hours 

and transact business in a commodity according to certain well-established rules and regulations.  

b) Regulating Trading 

As organized markets, commodity exchanges establish and enforce rules and regulations with a view 

to facilitating fair trading. The rules define the duties of members and specify the processes for 

business transactions. 

c) Collecting and Disseminating Market Information 

The buyers and sellers on the commodity exchange enter into deals for settlement in future, after 

assessing the trends in price and the prospects of an increase or decrease in prices of a commodity. 

The commodity exchange acts as an association of these traders, collecting the necessary in-

formation and the relevant statistical data and publishing it for the benefit of traders all over the 

country. 

d) Grading of Commodities 

Commodities which are traded on the commodity exchanges are graded according to quality. This 

enables dealers to quickly enter into agreements for the purchase and sale of commodities by 

description. 

e) Settling Disputes through Arbitration 

The commodity exchange provides the mechanism for the arbitration of trade disputes. 

1.5 Services Provided by a Commodity Exchange 

While performing these functions, the commodity exchanges also provide a variety of valuable services 

to the producers, consumers, traders and others parties in the ecosystem. 

The most important of such services are as follows: 



 

8 
 

a) The exchanges provide a ready and continuous market for the purchase and sale of commodities. 

The producer is enabled to be independent of the middlemen. 

b) By providing hedging facilities, the commodity exchanges reduce the effect of fluctuations in price. 

c) The commodity exchanges provide the producers an opportunity to transfer their risk to 

professional risk-bearers. 

d) By providing continuity in the trading of commodities, the commodity exchanges induce bankers 

and financiers to lend against commodities. 

e) The commodity exchanges provide facilities and opportunities for arbitrating and thus equalize the 

price levels of commodities at various centers. 

1.6 Commodity Exchanges and Clearing Houses 

Commodity exchanges depend on clearing houses to manage payments between buyers and sellers. 

Clearing houses are usually large banks and financial services companies. They guarantee each trade and 

thus require traders to make good-faith deposits (called margins) to ensure that traders have 

sufficient funds to handle potential losses and will not default on the trade. The risk borne by clearing 

houses lends further support to the strict quality, quantity, and delivery specifications of futures 

contracts. 

 

2. Current Landscape of Food and Raw Materials Trading 

2.1 High Barriers to Entry and Complexity 

Because of consolidation over the years, the trading of food and raw materials is controlled by a few 

exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Eurex Exchange. These exchanges 

trade in every kind of futures and options, including treasury bonds, indices and weather futures. 

Because of this consolidation and centralization over the years, the current landscape is made of a few 

dominant organizations which charge high fees and dictate requirements that present high barriers to 

entry for small investors. 

Additionally, unlike equity exchanges where there is active competition and liquidity is spread out, the 

structure and operations of these exchanges restrict the liquidity of futures, which creates significant 

challenges for traders who want to operate across markets in different continents. For example, a 

Chinese soybean farmer with customers in Germany who wants to hedge against a slowdown in the 

European economy will need to route his order through Eurex. 

2.2 High Fees 

Commodity futures exchanges are extremely profitable. For example, the CME Group had revenues of 

$3.6 billion and a net profit margin of 43% in 2016. About 85% of this revenue was received from 

transaction and clearing fees, paid by both buyers and sellers for each contract exchanged. 

It is fair to believe that these spectacular results are achieved thanks to the small number of players in 

the world and to high barriers to entry.  



 

9 
 

Also, centralized exchanges practice price discrimination to maximize profits. There are different 

categories of participants in the exchanges, such as high-frequency trading firms who hold for seconds 

and long-term traders who hold for months. Centralized exchanges charge these players different fees 

based on relationships and trading volumes. This practice makes the system very uncompetitive. 

For trading the S&P 500 E-mini contract, fees that traders are charged can be as high as $1.18 per 

contract. In addition to the transaction fees, individual traders are also required to pay brokerage fees 

ranging from $0.85 to $2.25, which makes the total cost of trading one S&P futures contract for an 

individual trader in the US about $2.04 to $3.44. 

2.3 Complex Processes 

Because the centralized exchanges have emerged due to consolidation over the years, their internal 

back-office systems tend to be complex, with several systems and processes for the different functions 

of the exchanges. These multiple systems and processes create significant operational costs which are 

passed on to the traders.  

The lack of standardization and complicated processes affects productivity and makes the systems 

inefficient. This situation offers a strong opportunity for a player based on the blockchain technology to 

disrupt the market. 

 

3. What is ChainTrade? 

3.1 The Platform 

ChainTrade is based on the CTT (standing for ChainTrade Token), an ERC20 compliant token. The token 

is used for all trading activities on the platform. The activities include but are not limited to trading, 

settlement of contracts, insurance, and leverage. 

For now, the ChainTrade platform allows the trading of options and futures on commodities only (food 

and raw materials). However, in a second phase, we plan to extend the platform to the trading of 

futures and options on equities, treasury bonds, and other types of underlyings. 

Token holders can operate on the ChainTrade platform as traders or insurers. Insurers guarantee each 

trade by providing insurance against the risk of default by the traders (counterparty risk). 

Our current prototype allows users to list Smart Contracts, view contract details, see order books, and 

place buy and sell orders.

3.2 Trading Process 

ChainTrade’s ecosystem consists of Traders (which can be food and raw materials producers, buyers, or 

speculators), Insurers, and Smart Contracts. 

The flow of activities in the ecosystem is described as follows: 

1. Trader A chooses an insurer and deposits collateral. Traders can choose insurers based on their 

preferences and on the conditions requested by each Insurer. 

2. Trader B, the counterparty, chooses an insurer and deposits collateral with it. The insurer can be 

the same with as Trader A’s insurer or a different insurer. 

3. Trader A selects the options required for the contract and submits his order. 

4. Trader B selects his own options and submits his order too. 



 

11 
 

5. The system selects the potentially matching orders, verifies that both traders have the required 

capital requirements for the trade by querying the records of their insurers. If the verification is 

successful, the trade is recorded on the public blockchain. To complete the process, ChainTrade 

initiates the associated Smart Contract with the parameters of the trade. 

6. The system monitors the contract and if the need arises for a margin call, the Smart Contract for 

that scenario is called to execute. 

7. When the contract expires, the system reports the price at expiration and closes out the 

contract by settling any payments with CTT tokens.  

8. In case of any potential technical glitch, human error, or issue with the settlement, an 

arbitration procedure ensures a fair and equitable outcome between the stakeholders. 

Below is a diagram showing a high-level overview of the process flow / infrastructure: 

 

 



 

12 
 

3.3 Smart Contracts  

A commodity contract (future or option) requires two parties: the buyer and seller. ChainTrade will 

utilize Smart Contracts to implement futures and options contracts. The Smart Contract defines the 

parameters of the trade such as date and place of delivery, and execute automatically on the exercise or 

expiration date of the contract. 

In order to protect investors and traders against the potential volatility of the CTT token, Smart 

Contracts may refer to another currency of reference, whether it be a fiat currency or a cryptocurrency. 

For example, a Smart Contract for delivery of corn in 6 months may refer to USD or Bitcoin as currency 

of reference. All trades are however effectively paid with the CTT token: the amount in CTT is set by the 

exchange rate between the currency of reference and the CTT at the date of the trade. 

3.4 Insurers 

ChainTrade’s platform allows certain people and financial institutions to cover for the counterparty risk 

of the traders. These risk undertakers are called insurers. The insurer guarantees the trade in case the 

insured trader defaults, i.e. they will pay the other trader the amount that is due. 

To understand the role that insurers play, let’s first describe the requirements of margin in the trade. 

A margin in the futures market is the amount of cash an investor must put up to open an account to 

start trading. This cash amount is the initial margin requirement and it is not a loan. It acts as a down 

payment on the underlying asset and helps ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations. Both buyers 

and sellers must put up payments. 

Initial Margin 

This is the initial amount of cash that must be deposited in the account to start trading contracts. It acts 

as a down payment for the delivery of the contract and ensures that the parties honor their obligations. 

Maintenance Margin 

This is the balance a trader must maintain in his or her account as the balance changes due to price 

fluctuations. It is a fraction (e.g. 75%) of the initial margin for a position. If the balance in the trader's 

account drops below this fraction, the trader is required to deposit enough funds or securities to bring 

the account back up to the initial margin requirement. Such a demand is referred to as a margin call.  

The trader can close his position in this case but he is still responsible for the loss incurred. However, if 

he closes his position, he is no longer at risk of the position losing additional funds. 

To make a transaction, traders first need to select an insurer to deposit their collateral with. The deposit 

is managed through a Smart Contract according to parameters agreed to by both parties. 

Insurers have the flexibility to set their own margin requirements and form part of an open market. 

Insurers are paid by traders for the length of time that a trade is unsettled. 

Insurers have the responsibility of making margin calls when a trader’s loss goes beyond the minimum 

margins for a contract. They are entitled to close positions early when a trader defaults. 



 

13 
 

3.5 Arbitration Procedure  

In case of technical glitches, material human errors, litigation between an insurer and a trader, issues 

with the settlement, or any other issues related to a Smart Contract, an arbitration procedure allows to 

settle the disputes in a fast, effective and low-cost way. 

Arbitrators may be individuals, companies, financial institutions, or other entities. The list of available 

arbitrators is public, along with their fees, and each Smart Contract must include an uneven list of 

arbitrators (typically three) appointed to settle any dispute related to that contract.  

The goal is to settle any dispute within two weeks, and most disputes within a few days.] 

3.6 Blockchain 

ChainTrade’s trading platform will be based on Ethereum. This allows us to take advantage of the 

blockchain features of Ethereum for decentralized trading. All trades will be recorded on the public 

Ethereum blockchain and Smart Contract will be used for implementing futures contracts and for margin 

deposits with insurers. 

Ethereum provides a good platform for ChainTrade due to its wide adoption, active development 

support, and growing ecosystem of distributed applications. 

However, ChainTrade will not record non-trade related data on the Ethereum blockchain, due to speed 

and cost considerations. These will be recorded on a separate delegated proof of stake chain. 

In order to conform with the execution time of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain (which takes 

several seconds at least), buy and sell orders will not be matched in real time. Instead we will implement 

a periodic settlement of orders, currently planned to take place every 5 minutes. Execution of orders 

and Smart Contract quotation will therefore follow a similar process to the opening and closing cross 

mechanism commonly used by various stock exchanges in the world. 

 

4. What makes ChainTrade unique 

4.1 Blockchain Technology 

A blockchain is a distributed ledger, that is made up of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages 

called blocks. These blocks of data are stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain is 

cryptographically encoded with information from the block preceding it, ensuring that all data in the 

chain is immutable and remains unchanged. 

Blockchain technology can essentially replace intermediaries or centralized systems as the underlying 

technology provides a mechanism for different parties to transact without the need for trust. 

A research conducted by Autonomous estimates that back office costs such as costs of clearing, 

settlement of trades, reconciliations, regulatory reporting, etc., represent about 30% of the cost of a 

commodity exchange. Blockchain technology has the potential to cut those costs by at least 80%. 

ChainTrade’s platform will be based on the Ethereum blockchain and will utilize Smart Contracts to 

facilitate the execution of contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries or expensive back office 



 

14 
 

processes. This will result in a lean and efficient platform that will offer fees that are significantly lower 

than current centralized commodities exchanges, making trading more profitable to all participants on 

the platform. 

4.2 No Barriers to Entry 

The trade of commodity futures is controlled by large entities like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 

(CME), and the Eurex Exchange. These exchanges have requirements that present high barriers to 

individual or smaller investors that want to participate in trading on the exchange. 

ChainTrade will provide a platform that will allow smaller investors to trade on its platform with minimal 

initial capital. ChainTrade will provide the CTT token, which any investor will be able to purchase on 

cryptocurrency exchanges, and which will give instant access to the trading platform. 

4.3 Low Fees 

The total cost of trading a futures contract for an individual trader in the US is about $2.04 to $3.44 with 

centralized exchanges. 

ChainTrade aims at cutting these fees by more than half, thanks to the blockchain technology allowing 

to remove intermediaries and streamline processes. 

4.4 Ensuring Liquidity 

Liquidity is key to the success of the platform and ChainTrade’s plan includes several aspects aiming at 

ensuring a high liquidity of the Smart Contracts. 

To attract traders from traditional exchanges, ChainTrade’s processes and interface will be designed to 

reduce the learning curve of experienced traders. 

Its initial Smart Contracts will mirror traditional futures and options contracts to smoothen the 

transition of current investors to the ChainTrade platform, and allow them to interchangeably buy and 

sell contracts on traditional exchanges and on ChainTrade. 

This will attract high volume investors and ensure liquidity in the system. 

4.5 Using Artificial Intelligence for KYC and AML 

Traditional methods for implementing “Know Your Customer (KYC)” and “Anti-Money Laundering 

(AML)” policies are manual, costly, error prone and inefficient. 

Implementing KYC is expensive: for example, according to a recent survey by Thomson Reuters, an 

average bank spends about $48 million a year on KYC compliance. As a trading platform, ChainTrade is 

submitted to KYC and AML obligations, which has a cost. 

However, ChainTrade will use Artificial Intelligence to enforce KYC and AML good practices, so as to 

dramatically reduce the cost of being KYC and AML compliant. Our primary objective is to build the AI 

tool internally (leveraging our team’s experience in AI), however an alternative would be to partner with 

existing AI crypto tools such as Civic or Coinfirm. 

Artificial Intelligence will cover link analysis, data analysis, and pattern recognition to ensure that only 

genuine traders participate in the platform – not criminal or terrorist organizations. 



 

15 
 

5. Business Model 

5.1 Growth Strategy 

ChainTrade will pursue a strategy of aggressive marketing and sales to achieve its goal of securing 5% of 

the global volume of food and raw materials trading by 2020.  

ChainTrade plans to attract traders and investors to its platform by providing highly competitive fees. 

Based on its lean and efficient platform, traders can expect to pay less than half of the fees they are 

currently paying at the current exchanges for each contract. 

5.2 Transaction Forecast 

ChainTrade plans to disrupt a market of circa 10 billion transactions per annum.  

As an illustration, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) recorded a revenue of $3.5 billion in 

2016, with an average daily volume of 15.6 million contracts and about 3.9 billion contracts for the year. 

Eurex recorded 1.72 billion contracts and a revenue of €1 billion in 2016. 

Based on its market research and estimate of the potential, ChainTrade’s Business Plan aims at reaching 

transaction volumes of: 

▪ H2 2018 – 5 million transactions 

▪ 2019 – 80 million transactions 

▪ 2020 – 500 million transactions 

6. The ChainTrade Token 
ChainTrade is based on the CTT token (ERC20 compliant). The total number of CTT tokens is 42,034,200. 

The CTT token is a utility token that allows its holders to use the ChainTrade platform, pay transaction 

fees, and trade the Smart Contracts available on the platform. 

7. Project Roadmap  
ChainTrade is working with an aggressive three-year timetable to ensure that the project progresses 

within the shortest possible timeframe.  

For purpose of legal compliance, Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC has been engaged as solicitors to the 

company as to Singapore law. 

The history and roadmap for the project are as follows: 



 

16 
 



 

17 
 



 

18 
 

 

  



 

19 
 

8. Project Team 
We have a strong team made of experienced tech entrepreneurs, excellent blockchain developers, 

technical advisors, former traders and bankers, former Strategy Director of NYSE and Euronext, VC 

partners interested in blockchains,…  

They are bringing their interdisciplinary experience and combined passion for blockchain to make 

ChainTrade a successful company. 

 



 

20 
 

 

 

9. Regulatory Environment 
 

COMPLIANCE 

Legal aspects are key to the success of the ChainTrade project, as we will need to obtain the necessary 

regulatory approvals in the market(s) where we will operate.  



 

21 
 

Singapore being the place of trading, we will first seek regulatory approval from the Singaporean 

authorities (the Monetary Authority of Singapore). 

In the current state of the regulation, it is not yet known whether a separate regulatory approval will be 

required in other markets where traders will be located (but not ChainTrade). In view of the regulatory 

uncertainty to date, our roadmap also plans to seek green light or approval from European authorities, 

US authorities, and Chinese authorities (and potentially more authorities), progressively over time, if 

and when required. 

In any case, ChainTrade will always endeavor to comply with any applicable law and regulation. We 

recognize the importance of complying with the regulations applicable in Singapore and potentially in 

other countries, with regards to token sales, cryptocurrencies, and trading derivatives. ChainTrade has 

therefore retained the services of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, a global law firm, to advise on the 

regulatory frameworks and ensure that all required licenses and authorizations are obtained, to trade 

futures and options legally on the blockchain.  

We recognize the important role that regulators play in safeguarding markets and building trust, so we 

intend to work with them to ensure that our platform complies with regulations and provides a safe and 

reliable trading environment for all market participants. 

 

THE CTT TOKEN 

The CTT token is a tool to be used in trading on the ChainTrade platform. The CTT token should not be 

expected to gain value or have value outside of this role. A token is only used at the behest of the token 

owner, and any time it is used, there is a possibility that the token will lose value or be lost. 

The CTT token is not an investment in any way and is not a security. The possession or ownership of the
