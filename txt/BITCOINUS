A WORD FROM THE CEO

The world of finance is about to change beyond belief. Decentralized blockchain technology brings incredible 
new opportunities to our society. Everyone can now be an equal part of a newly forming ecosystem of either 
financial or socially influential movements. 

Bitcoinus has formed a team of highly ambitious blockchain professionals to achieve an important goal — to 
become the leader of online crypto processing industry. Our experienced team have previously worked with 
a highly successful ICO as well as other online based projects. Attracting over $80 million worth of crypto 
capital shows exactly what our team is capable of. 

Online retail industry continues to rise sharply. According to all major experts, the revenues of e-commerce 
will double in the coming 3 to 4 years. This fact reflects where Bitcoinus is going with its business 
development. While the market share of traditional payment processing companies will also increase over 
this period, crypto processing is expected reach an absolutely unprecedented new level. 

Currently the adoption of blockchain based payments on the major online retailers is LESS THAN 1% in 
comparison to all traditional payment methods. This is exactly why the timing and opportunities for Bitcoinus 
to start expanding could not be any better. Most of the blockchain experts agree that the implementation of 
various decentralized solutions has only just started and is currently in its infancy. 

Bitcoinus online crypto processing will instantly allow everyone to use cryptocurrencies for all types of 
payments. The growth of our industry is projected to develop exponentially. This is where the money is today 
and this is where more money will be tomorrow. 

I would like to personally thank you for supporting the Bitcoinus project. Together we will take part in 
reinventing the online payment industry. 

Sincerely,

XAVIER MURTZA

CEO

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �3



VISION

In the digital age not all revolutions have already happened. Breakthrough of blockchain technology 
essentially changes the understanding of money as a traditional payment method. 

A variety of blockchain based cryptocurrencies has started to disrupt many areas from traditional banking, all 
the way to online payments processing. This is where Bitcoinus come in. 

The vision that has inspired us to create Bitcoinus comes from incredible dynamics of the cryptocurrency 
market. Ever-increasing acceptance makes them an equivalent part of global financial ecosystem. 

What it means to us is that e-commerce units of any type and scale will start to adopt the blockchain based 
payment technologies. It will require innovative yet secure and wide reaching payments processing service 
providers. 

Market is growing exponentially. All e-shops as well as big retailers where you currently shop are on the 
threshold of integrating blockchain based payment methods. 

It is perfect timing for Bitcoinus to emerge and lead the evolution of crypto-payments. We focus on real, living 
processes of B2B businesses which will be reinvented according to the global markets needs. This is the 
direction Bitcoinus has chosen and that is the way e-commerce is headed. We will make sure that spending 
all types of crypto-holdings is instant and secure for both individuals and businesses.

1. FUTURE OF ONLINE PAYMENTS

1.1. TOP 100 COINS 
Single wallet — hundreds of opportunities

Bitcoinus will be developing a platform for effective B2B business-oriented crypto processing. To make sure 
the individual clients as well as all business needs are met, the first stage of Bitcoinus platform development 
will integrate the 100 most used and trusted cryptocurrencies.  

Different businesses have different needs. The blockchain based currencies have brought a completely 
different approach to it as a method of payment. The fact alone that a currency can be pre-programmed to 
also provide additional functions in certain environments (tokens) requires a new universal tool to make them 
spendable. This tool will be Bitcoinus online processing platform where the most popular cryptocurrencies 
will be available to every business. 

1.2. BLOCKCHAIN BASED KYC 
We will protect your crypto-assets

In the current situation with ordinary bank cards — there are many risks when it comes to online payments. A 
wide number of phishing schemes and other scams can easily be performed with the centralized networks 
as they currently are. 

Bitcoinus will literally disable this sort of risk because of our sophisticated KYC standards which will be 
necessary to comply with in order to become our business client. Minimizing the service fees and generally 
making our service affordable to even the smallest, business is our priority but only if they comply with strict 
regulations and good practice of the blockchain community. Bitcoinus will implement blockchain based KYC 
to ensure maximum reliability of information distribution. 

The individual customers of our clients will certainly be happy with this sort of approach. The general power 

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �4



and acceptance of cryptocurrencies will increase at a much higher pace when all security measures are in 
place. This is simply because everyone can trust the other party which is certainly not the case at the 
moment. 

We believe in the synergy of blockchain and ordinary business but it must be built on trust.

1.3. GLOBAL PAYMENT SOLUTION FOR E-COMMERCE
One-click crypto payments? Yes, please

Bitcoinus is building a platform that will enable exceptionally fast crypto transactions. Current situation where 
transaction speed is low and its cost is high cannot be used in most e-commerce businesses. Bitcoinus will 
change the way transactions interact within internal system due to our complex algorithm which enables 
certain operations to be performed before they are uploaded to blockchain. Yet it will remain secure and 
reliable as it should. 

The platform enables a merchant to receive the funds in up to 2 seconds. For all global businesses it is very 
important to be able to get all funds at its disposal as soon as possible. The Bitcoinus platform will reduce the 
time of receiving funds from days or weeks to a couple of seconds. Certain current payment gateways can 
delay the receipt of funds by 1 to 2 weeks, especially when a transaction needs to clear though faraway (or 
less trusted) bank locations. 

�

Great example would be a simple e-shop where our client sells trending electronics. When a retail customer 
pays for the goods, a merchant gets his funds straight away. No delay, no uncertainty about payment 
gateway failures, frauds or slow and problematic international bank transactions. 

Transaction gets uploaded to the blockchain of whichever cryptocurrency that is used as a payment method. 
It only takes 1 to 2 seconds for everybody to see the transaction making it transparent and fast. 

In this whole chain of business processes is the cash flow. Currently there are obvious difficulties when it 
comes to small businesses desire to sell as much trending production as they can. 

All money that could fuel the growth of a small business gets trapped in the layer of financial middlemen. 
What it means to a small business is that there is no way to grow fast unless they borrow much more capital 
to increase their cash flow. Borrowing money means added risk. Getting their own money back the minute a 
product is purchased simply eliminates the need to borrow and enables any small business to expand at a 
much faster pace using their own funds.

1.4. REVOLUTIONARY TRANSACTION FEE
Our fee — almost free

Advantages of Bitcoinus payment processing platform is, of course, its cost. Bitcoinus will only charge 0.5% 

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �5



commission on all transactions. In comparison with other processing companies and service providers, 
Bitcoinus will be the most cost effective on the market. 

The low price of a transaction performs two important roles:

a) Cost effective alternative to traditional banking and other payment service providers for any type 
of online based business.

b) Encourage businesses to adapt crypto currencies much more effectively. Bitcoinus is going to 
bring the benefits of blockchain to every business unit around the world.

The Bitcoinus team is less concentrated on getting the maximum amount of commission but rather the 
spread of the technology worldwide. Quick and effective market penetration of an incredibly dynamic 
blockchain industry is more important than focusing on a single line on a P/L sheet today.

Our business strategy is designed to reach the most e-commerce business units and enable their potential in 
the newly forming industry of decentralized global payments.

1.5. TRANSACTION ALGORITHM
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

�

Illustration shows how complex the current online payment algorithm is. Due to the number of layers, the 
transaction has many risks passing through each of them. Complexity of the payment process means it is 
also expensive as there usually are around 16 steps in every end-to-end transaction. There is no way any of 
the online payment gateways could offer such a low cost transaction as the one offered by Bitcoinus. The 
reason is simple; less layers = less complexity = lower cost. 

Incomparably more efficient payment processing only became possible by adopting blockchain technology 
as the main backbone of the solution.

A typical purchase algorithm of any product using e-commerce tools:

�  

1

Buyer uses their bank card 
to make a payment.

2

Necessary currency 
amount gets transmitted 

over the payment 
processing service 

provider.

3

Payment processing 
service provider transfer 
the transaction data to 

Card association.

4

Association transmits the 
payment request to the 

bank.

8

Transaction finalized.

7

Payment provider delivers 
the result back to Seller.

5

Bank either approves or 
declines the requested 

transaction.

6

Card association sends 
the information back to the 

payment provider.

3

Bitcoinus platform 
proceed with the 

payment. 

4

After the transaction is 
done — both parties get 

notified. Done.

2

They select the desired 
Altcoin.

1

A potential buyer desires 
to purchase an item with 

a preferred 
cryptocurrency.

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �7



1.6. MERCHANT REPUTATION SYSTEM
100% trusted merchants meet 100% trustworthy clients

�

There are cases when for one reason or another either the transaction or the item does not meet the 
requirements of the other party. If both of those parties can resolve the issue on their own — it’s great, but if 
they cannot?

Bitcoinus platform will introduce merchant rating. It will apply to all of our clients who sell anything anywhere. 
Let’s say the retail client does not get its item due to some unforeseen circumstances.

No matter which party might have caused the issue it is always important to have a back up. In the cases 
where both parties do not reach agreement within a 7 day period, there will be a procedure initiated which 
will involve a 3rd party moderator. This person will be acting as a neutral party who will initiate an effective 
issue solving procedure for both — buyer and seller. 

In case of common agreement, no negative feedback will remain on either party. However, if similar cases 
start to emerge more often and will involve the same merchant or a buyer, Bitcoinus team reserve the right to 
exclude the seller from the platform to prevent any loss of funds or possible frauds of any kind. 

In general, all buyers will be able to rate all the sellers that will be using our platform as their processing tool. 
Bitcoinus will monitor the transactions and all feedback generation carefully in order to maintain the high 
transparency of all cryptocurrency related operations.

2. DISRUPTING THE OLD ORDER

Decentralized revolution for online payments

�

On of the main visions beyond the development of the Bitcoinus platform is a desire to create synergy of 
online processing efficiency and increase opportunities for cryptocurrencies. 

Cryptocurrency general acceptance prevails among the individual users. On one hand, it offers great 
opportunities to all sorts of transactions making them fast, low cost and secure. On the other hand, this is 
one of the most desired combination to any business making it easy to adapt.

According to Bitcoinus philosophy and the currently fast changing rules of the financial world: it seems that 
one important message is clear — the evolution of decentralized networks will continue to increase at an 
even more rapid pace.

Bitcoinus will enable everyone to buy cryptocurrencies using their ordinary bank cards. All purchased Alt-
coins will also be stored in secure wallets. Moreover, we will be providing the most cost effective and efficient 
B2B online payment processing solution. 

This widely covering solution which starts from every individual and ends at any of the largest corporations is 
unique. Bitcoinus focuses on reaching all members of the financial ecosystem in order to implement smooth 
and fast service. This may only be possible by eliminating as many layers as possible which is what we aim 
to do.

2.1. CRYPTO MARKET CAP TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF
Riding the ultimate market growth

The cryptocurrency market capitalization increases rapidly. Having in mind that it is only the beginning of the 
blockchain era; Bitcoinus believe in the exponential growth of combined e-commerce and blockchain 
technologies. 

We believe that the future growth of the crypto payment processing service market share will increase along

with the value of cryptocurrencies. To imagine the direction of this market, take a look at the latest trends of a 
couple of major crypto’s:

2.2. E-COMMERCE
Exponential growth of crypto adoption 

It is also important to look at e-commerce sales growth alone. Even without the involvement of blockchain 
technology, the industry is set to double in generating revenues 3-4 years from now. It is a considerably short 
period of time for such growth of a not so new industry. 

E-commerce market share in Q3 2017, as a percentage of all retail sales, has increased to 9.1% according 
to the US Census Bureau, up from 3.5% just a decade ago.

In 2017, according to Statista, “The gross merchandise volume of business-to-business e-commerce 
transactions is projected to amount to 7.66 trillion US dollars, up from 5.83 trillion US dollars in 2013.” That 
difference in growth almost matches the entire amount of projected transactions in B2C e-commerce, at 
$2.143 trillion in 2017.

It is important to mention that mobile commerce, accounting for $161 billion at the end of 2016, is set to jump 
to $319 billion by 2020.

According to McKinsey, 1.4 billion people will join the global middle class by 2020, and 85% will be in the 
Asia Pacific region. CPG and retailers who enter this space early will have a competitive advantage in 
meeting market demand.

Now if we add our perception from the blockchain technology point of view it is important to underline some 
facts. Currently the adoption of the blockchain based currencies in online payment systems amount to less 
than ONE PERCENT of all online payments made.

For the industry early bird investors and blockchain enthusiasts this number might be a bit shocking as it 
feels a bit different when you live in the blockchain community formed bubble. Bitcoinus highlights simple 
facts of the financial world which would not be obvious if statistics of the overall market situation wasn’t 
analyzed. This analysis has been done by Bitcoinus and that’s why it is important to grasp the vast potential 
in cryptocurrency buying, selling and online processing market. 

In a way, it is not even there yet. Bitcoinus will be the first company to combine all aspects for buying, 
storing, selling and receiving (B2B) crypto assets. 

Following figure represents the market estimate of historical and future e-commerce (retail) growth.

2.3. RISKS OF FINANCIAL FRAUD
Safer, traceable and instant — crypto payments for the world

One major issue of any decentralized currency is essentially a risk of fraud. With Bitcoinus payment 
processing and online payment solutions we will ensure that only you control your private information about 
all your assets. 

Bitcoinus will be designed to step away from the centralization of information and ensure that no single entity 
can see, impact or manipulate any financial data of any individual or business. 

All private keys of the wallets will only be known to the owner of that particular wallet. 

The other side of the business is the relationship between buyers and merchants. Since almost 2% of total 
revenues are lost each year because of fraudulent purchases, the centralization of payment mechanics 
simply does not work well enough. 

Bitcoinus will utilize the best of what blockchain technology can offer to create a rating system in order to 
prevent or minimize the potential loss of funds. One good thing about the decentralized technologies is that 
most of the transactions can be easily and publicly seen on most of the blockchain networks. This will 
instantly create an environment to prevent continuous fraud coming from the same sources.

Cutting-edge innovations for emerging revolution

�  
Bitcoinus is all about providing two main solutions:

a) Creating a payment gateway for utilizing over 100 cryptocurrencies that will be integrated into the 
platform in the first year.

b) Developing a powerful online payment processing system. It will enable all online businesses to 
accept an increasing amount of altcoins as a payment method.

Combining all of it with the merchant rating system will make it better than any of the existing online payment 
providers. It is not about the fact of only adopting crypto as the main source of financing. It is about the 
combining FIAT with crypto to create and maintain the powerful bond between the traditional and the most 
groundbreaking financial technologies. 

3.1. E-COMMERCE PLUGINS 
One of the first stages of successful market penetration will be to develop the plug-ins for the most popular 
and most widely used e-commerce platforms such as Magento 2, Shopify, Wordpress, ZenCart, 
WooCommerce, OpenCart, PrestaShop and others. Companies like Microsoft, KFC and Apple already 
accept Bitcoin and some other major cryptocurrencies on their platforms. Quality crypto processing 
increasingly becomes a standard.

The plug-ins will work together with the Bitcoinus platform which will enable all crypto assets to be utilized 
whenever necessary by its holder. This sort of combined solution will enormously enhance the safety of 
transactions as well as their speed.

3.2. THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES
Empowered by visionaries, developed by professionals

Since we have already started to develop our initial MVP, the processes will continue through our ICO 
campaign. The first working part of the project should be finished by September of 2018. In this stage 
Bitcoinus team will create plug-ins for the majority of the main e-commerce platforms which will enable an 
effective processing service. Swift interaction with the main Bitcoinus platform will make sure the payments 
get transmitted flawlessly. 

By the end of the first quarter of 2019 the Bitcoinus team plan to get all major functionality finished and the 
finalised solution will be widely available for e-commerce and individual clients. 

3.3. ONLINE PAYMENT
The Bitcoinus platform will be designed for buying goods and services. The new solution based on 
decentralized networks is being developed to offer more than any other crypto-oriented platforms today. Our 
team is focused on rapid adoption of the technology in global markets which will make online payments 
using cryptocurrencies advance forward when we speak about all global financial markets. The buyer, the 
merchant and the initial token contributors will perform an important role in this evolution of financial 
independence based on implemented blockchain solutions.

3.4. IN-STORE PAYMENTS 
Bitcoinus platform will be a payment processor solution.

It will simply ensure that merchants could accept multiple cryptocurrencies from buyers while receiving their 
funds in ordinary traditional currencies. 

Bitcoinus is currently focused on development of the most advanced processing solution in order to deliver 
the following: 

• Transparency between merchant and consumer. Elimination of most of the existing risk is the 
key to successful blockchain evolution leading to a possible revolution of the financial industry 
as we know it.

• Smooth conversion between crypto and FIAT currencies at the point of purchase.
• Option to buy, hold and spend Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency using the single 

platform of Bitcoinus.

• Integrated internal currency conversion as an additional service.
Bitcoinus will provide an API in order to combine the traditional payment system benefits with the speed and 
major advantages of blockchain based payments. All integrations and further development of plug-ins will be 
made in order to successfully maintain the right level of innovation and maximum satisfaction as well as 
convenience for both — individual customer and business.

3.5. INSTANT PAYMENT NOTIFICATIONS (IPN)
The IPN system will notify your server when you receive a payment and when a payment status changes. 
This is an easy and useful way to integrate our payments into your software to automate order completion, 
digital downloads, accounting, or whatever you can think up.

It is implemented by making a HTTP POST call over an https:// or http:// URL to a script or CGI program on 
your server.

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �13



3.6. BITCOINUS API
The Bitcoinus API will provide access to our services and information to our sellers. API is important for us to 
make sure that a variety of additional implementation makes it possible to increase the added value to our 
clients. 

Bitcoinus API application layer will be created to be used to distribute information and services to new client 
segments which can be personalized to create custom user experiences.

3.7. VARIETY OF INTEGRATED BUTTONS
Bitcoinus solution will enable a simple integration of crypto payments through making buttons appear on the 
majority of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Below are the basic examples of buttons that will be 
developed for future integrations:

Simple Buttons 
Advanced Buttons 
Shopping Cart Buttons 
Donation Buttons

4. BUSINESS MODEL

Global reach for local victories

The Bitcoinus team is less concentrated on getting the maximum amount of commission but rather the 
spread of the technology worldwide. Quick and effective market penetration of the incredibly dynamic 
blockchain industry is more important than focusing on a single line of a P/L sheet today. Therefore we will 
be executing an intensive marketing and global sales campaign in order to lead the market. The Bitcoinus 
platform will be integrated into most of the e-commerce platforms. 

Our business strategy is designed to reach the majority of e-commerce business units and enable their 
potential in the newly forming industry of decentralized global payments. Our 0.5% commission for a 
transaction is already an important point to make when we speak about business and even the competition. 
Most of it spins around the offers that are close to what any payment gateways. Similar or slightly lower fees 
cannot act as a sufficient catalyst for booming technology where low cost and efficiency are always the 
highlighted factors.

Bitcoinus will not only charge the lowest fee, but will also ensure the quality of the transactions in terms of 
speed, effectiveness and availability to businesses. Our experience in similar projects will make Bitcoinus go 
straight to where it is supposed to be — the leading brand of online crypto payment processing industry.

5. MARKETING AND STRATEGY

Marketing is one of the most important considerations for any business, particularly in the e-commerce 
space. With costs continuing to climb, brands are being forced to find new and engaging ways to market 
their products and implement new cost saving innovations.

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, brands are given access to more and more innovative ways to 
engage with customers and build lasting experiences. From loyalty programs to partnerships to 
personalization, the possibilities are virtually endless, making the future of e-commerce very promising and 
extremely impactful. 

5.1. NETWORK EFFECT 
The strategy of Bitcoinus business development will be to not only spread as fast as technically possible but 
also on developing a trust and reputation system which will empower our expansion by live feedback and 
continuous improvements.

As mentioned above, the our main goal is to be widely available for all online businesses. There are a great 
many ways of achieving this and all of them require hard work and impeccable performance. This is where 
the Bitcoinus team is strong and will be further evolving together with the industry.

It is also important to educate the newly forming clientele. Not all businesses are fully (or even somewhat) 
aware of the benefits that blockchain technology is bringing. We will make sure the information and these 
advantages are well communicated.

8. LEGAL NOTICE

This whitepaper (“Whitepaper”), in its current form, is being circulated by Bitcoinus (referred to as the 
Company in this Whitepaper) for general information and to invite community feedback only on the Bitcoinus 
project as presently conceived.

The Whitepaper is subject to review and revision by the Company (as referred to in this Whitepaper), the 
board of advisers and/or legal advisers of Bitcoinus. Please do not replicate or distribute any part of this 
Whitepaper without this legal notice. No part of this Whitepaper is intended to create legal relations with the 
recipients of this Whitepaper or to be legally binding or enforceable by such recipient against Bitcoinus. An 
updated version of this Whitepaper may be published and announced by Bitcoinus operating in its sole and 
absolute discretion.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION AND THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS ENTITLED “DISCLAIMER OF 
LIABILITY”, “NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES”, “REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
BY YOU”, “CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS”, “THIRD PARTY 
INFORMATION AND NO CONSENT OF OTHER PERSONS”, “TERMS USED”, “NO ADVICE”, “NO 
FURTHER INFORMATION OR UPDATE”, “RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND DISSEMINATION”, 
“NO OFFER OF INVESTMENT OR REGISTRATION” AND “RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES” CAREFULLY. IF 
YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ACTION YOU SHOULD TAKE, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR 
LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR(S).

Bitcoinus (BITS) tokens are not intended to constitute securities of any form, units in a business trust, units in 
a collective investment scheme or any other form of investment in any jurisdiction. This Whitepaper does not 
constitute a prospectus or offer document of any sort and is not intended to constitute an offer of securities of 
any form, units in a business trust, units in a collective investment scheme or any other form of investment, 
or a solicitation for any form of investment in any jurisdiction.

While this Whitepaper does not preclude Bitcoinus from offering holders of BITS tokens a share of the 
revenue generated from the commercial applications of Bitcoinus, such offer, if any, and the extent thereof, 
will be at the sole and absolute discretion of Bitcoinus. Accordingly, there is no assurance whatsoever as to 
whether such offer will be made and holders of BITS tokens should have no expectation of receiving any 
such offer. No BITS token should be construed, interpreted, classified or treated as enabling, or according 
any opportunity to, purchasers to participate in or receive profits, income, or other payments or returns 
arising from or in connection with the Bitcoinus platform or products, BITS tokens or the proceeds of the 
BITS token generation event (as described in this Whitepaper), or to receive sums paid out of such profits, 
income, or other payments or returns.

This Whitepaper does not constitute or form part of any opinion on any advice to sell, or any solicitation of 
any offer by Bitcoinus to purchase any BITS tokens nor shall it or any part of it nor the fact of its presentation 
form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Bitcoinus will 
deploy all proceeds of sale of the BITS tokens to support ongoing development of the Bitcoinus products and 
ecosystem. No person is obligated to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the 
sale and purchase of the BITS tokens and no cryptocurrency nor other form of payment is to be accepted on 
the basis of this Whitepaper. Any agreement as between Bitcoinus and you as a purchaser, and in relation to 
any sale and purchase of BITTS tokens (as referred to in this Whitepaper) is to be governed by a separate 
document setting out the terms and conditions (the “T&Cs”) of such an agreement. In the event of any 
inconsistencies between the T&Cs and this Whitepaper, the former shall prevail.

No regulatory authority has examined or approved of any of the information set out in this Whitepaper. No 
such action has been or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The 
publication, distribution or dissemination of this Whitepaper does not imply that the applicable laws, 

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �19



regulatory requirements or rules have been complied with. There are significant risks and uncertainties 
associated with Bitcoinus and its business and operations, the BITS tokens, the BITS and the Bitcoinus 
ecosystem (each as referred to in this Whitepaper). This Whitepaper, any part thereof and any copy thereof 
must not be taken or transmitted to any country where distribution or dissemination of this Whitepaper is 
prohibited or restricted. No part of this Whitepaper is to be reproduced, distributed or disseminated without

BITCOINUS WHITEPAPER �21



by the public and oral statements that may be made by Bitcoinus or its directors, executive officers, advisers

statements, including but not limited to statements as to Bitcoinus’s current or future revenue and profitability, 
prospects, future plans, other expected industry trends and other matters discussed in this Whitepaper 
regarding Bitcoinus are matters that are not historical facts, but only predictions. These forward-looking 
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual 
future results, performance or achievements of Bitcoinus to be materially different from any future results, 
performance or achievements expected, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

These factors include, amongst others:

respective businesses and operations;

compete under such conditions;

(i) changes in the future capital needs of Bitcoinus and the availability of financing and capital to fund 
such needs;

(j) war or acts of international or domestic terrorism;

(k) occurrences of catastrophic events, natural disasters and acts of God that affect the businesses and/
or operations of Bitcoinus;

(l) other factors beyond the control of Bitcoinus; and (m) any risk and uncertainties associated with 
Bitcoinus and its businesses and operations, the BITS tokens, the BITS and the Bitcoinus ecosystem 
(each as referred to in the Whitepaper).

All forward-looking statements made by or attributable to Bitcoinus or persons acting on behalf of Bitcoinus 
are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. Given that risks and uncertainties that may cause the 
actual future results, performance or achievements of Bitcoinus to be materially different from that expected, 
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Whitepaper, undue reliance must not be 
placed on these statements. These forward-looking statements are applicable only as of the date of this 
Whitepaper. Neither Bitcoinus nor any other person represents, warrants and/or undertakes that the actual 
future results, performance or achievements of Bitcoinus will be as discussed in those forward-looking 
statements. The actual results, performance or achievements of Bitcoinus may differ materially from those

upon as a promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance or policies of Bitcoinus.

announce any revisions to those forward-looking statements to reflect future developments, events or 
circumstances, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
